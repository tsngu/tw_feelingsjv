#####

it creates an addiction at the level of cult of the lamb and loop hero i think i will continue to give my hours for a long time i definitely recommend it also after starting this game i bought fins and mask and started diving

#####

i stopped playing zelda to play this

#####

im a game developer and im overwhelmed with how toxic the industry has become in the last 10 years due to greed and venture capital games have transformed from actual toys to play and have fun to machines for juicing and parasiting on users addictions and cravings

in that context of our society dave the diver is an amazing relief and gives me back my inner child passion to get back to making videogames that really are fun to play to make an art form with love to make content just for the sake of telling a good interactive story to give a nice moment to people

this game is a 1010 it never stops giving you new content and new core mechanics even in the late game the game has lots of minigames to solve and when you thought youve seen and perfected all the core mechanics suddenly a new map town or challenge is unlocked with completely new mechanics to learn and master it doesnt recycle too much it doesnt take the easy path its development demonstrates what is really possible when you make something with love and real effort and not just for an easy cash grab

i want more games like this i want to make games like this not a single lootbox in sight not a single child becoming a gambler as an adult

every dive is a test of your ability every night is one more result of your pursuit of culinary arts

dave the diver is a perfect game

this is the second game i have ever sought the achievements for the first being bloodstained ritual of the night but i told myself that i would be fair to the games i have played by getting all of their achievements if i truly love the game and you can assured that this review will sing nothing but praise of dave and his diving

lets talk about story you play as a large fellow named dave he is a diver and he has approached by an old acquaintance named cobra who sells him on the idea of getting sushi only to be met with the cold and studious bancho a disgraced sushi chef who recently came back into the food world the goal to make the best sushi in the world from the fish that can be found in the blue hole a wondrous ever changing undersea phenomenon rife with a diverse and colorful ecosystem your job as dave the diver is to dive into the blue hole and collect the ingredients bancho needs to perfect his craft

along the way of becoming the best sushi restaurant you meet an amazing slew of characters from banchos old boss to a washed up farmer to an overenthusiastic archaeologist to a weeb obsessed with making special equipment you meet them you dine them they in turn help you and bancho and along the way you find out the mystery of the very recent and violent earthquakes the game does a fantastic job of portraying all of the side characters and their quirky pixel by pixel animated cutscenes will always floor you its always a highlight to watch

the gameplay itself is a mysterious one you spend the morning and the afternoon diving for fish and in the evening you open your restaurant for the rest of the night by morning you start the cycle again the game paces you out by giving you minimal diving tools to catch fish initially armed only with a knife and a harpoon gun as you progress you gain access to more tools more guns more things to grab more fish youre also met with various minigames that open up new parts of the blue hole for how repetitive the cycle of diving is somehow you are never bored its always one more dive and the developers were super smart to change up the gameplay in many ways to keep your attention in bitesized portions but allow you the freedom of staying in the water until youre full or as long as you want however the challenges of the violent undersea fauna will prove to be your biggest obstacles in obtaining your menu for the day once you kill them its a success once you capture them youre overjoyed in how much youve collected

there are bosses theyre not hard but theyre not easy either and the game allows you to try as many times as you need without needlessly shoving you back to the surface should you fail although you do have the choice the game isnt needlessly cruel and ultimately it wants you to come back and feel like you have a chance

dont wanna dive cause you wanna do other things do it skip the night ill also want to say do not feel like youre going to miss things permanently theres only one thing that i think is missable and its an achievement for an easter egg the game allows you to take your time and as long as you need even if you miss certain events theyll come back dont worry

the otherside of this is the night time portion of the game banchos sushi you are the manager of this establishment as bancho leads the kitchen your job is to not only gather the ingredients but to serve your customers refill the wasabi manage and hire new people train them and also spend your hard earned gold in whatever way you see fit the better you perform in your restaurant the more you can afford for upgrades training new dishes new interior to the point where youll try to find ways to automate the night no man is an island and dave and bancho cannot run this restaurant by themselves i thoroughly enjoyed this moment in the game because it allows you to see the fruits of your labor

you also gain new ways to source your ingredients as you open a fish farm and eventually land farming your cycles will continue to optimize as you keep playing and enjoying yourself

the music is superb and perhaps its the only place where i feel like its not done enough justice the games soundtrack is so good and full bordering on mystifying to relaxing to action packed and the game allows you to play the soundtracks on your phone as you find them what it doesnt do is let you play the music anywhere in the game and i think thats criminal because there are so many good tracks youll be hooked on every beat and theme the sound design is also a great area where this game shines due to the sound of moving through the water the sound of your harpoon hooking the funny babbles of the npcs as they speak nonsense but you get it my favorite noise being dr bacon when hes flailing his hands in excitement or dave when hes disappointed

so not only did i learn all about sushi but i learned a lot about marine wildlife and the different biomes in which a lot of these fish live in yeah i totally served narwahl to my guests but i learned about their majesty i learned the cruelty of the sea but this game also let me ride on a beluga pet them and save a manatee this game is simply a joy

honestly the real reason im writing this is because the game happens so fast this game is so good its just about a perfect game with so much heart in it you can hardly put the controller down if you had any doubts dispel them 

put on your wet suit and dive goodbyeternity

side note i may have a huge crush on dave in general what a cutie

#####

the trailers do a good job of explaining what the core gameplay loop will be dive into the ocean collecting fish turn that fish into sushi to use at the restaurant where customers pay you money turn the money into upgrades go back to diving with better gear rinse and repeat 

what may not come across quite as strongly is how well paced and soothing everything is diving around for fish does have moments of punctuated panic where youre trying to expertly dodge sharks or land shots with your harpoon gun to reel in that particularly agile fish youve been hunting but the vast majority of the time is simply exploring the everchanging cove and gently floating alongside the local marine life 

the jumps between the panic and the breezy bits is really well done the restaurant management makes for a nice change of pace between your dives and the additional layers that come later ill refrain from mentioning the other things youll visit manage later in the game mean that even after 16 hours i was still finding new directions that the game would go in 

theres not a lot more to say than that the animations are delightful the characters and the dialogue is funny and the gameplay hits the note between panic and relaxation really well id heartily recommend dave the diver and im looking forward to where else this game goes once its out of early access

#####

dr bacon rewarded me with a bottle of olive oil for discovering mysterious ancient sea people

#####

as a very very picky gamer dave the diver absolutely hits well made and loaded with content every time i reach a place in this game where it feels like ive done just about everything more new content shows up its actually the biggest dopamine hit ive gotten from a game in ages theres just always something newmore to do and to think this isnt even the full release yet highly recommended

full release edit yeah it somehow just got 10x better

#####

h1yup this is peak of worksimtwoinone gameh1

at first i was skeptical about this game wondering why did dave the diver blow up while others of same genre didnt well now i can certainly say i understand everything now the strong core gameplay loop accompanied with the sheer amount of features and events easily make the game charming and fun things dont stop there the story and the characters are oozing with personality the humorous cutscenes various events to spice up the restaurantmanaging experience and a ton of mini games sprinkled over each quests and regions all packaged up together in this lovely pixelated indie darling it is no wonder that dave the diver receives such an overwhelmingly positive review i would go even further and say that it is one of the best in the worksimtwoinone genre it would be really hard to topple this giant i cannot recommend dave the diver enough

h1things i like about dave the diverh1

b1 looting before fishingb
like every other workingsimulators you always need to start from scratch and gather as much resources as possible however dave the diver does things a little differently scattering around the ocean floor are various boxes inside each boxes contain equipments that are slightly stronger than your basic onethey will break when you leave the water so it is always better to loot the boxes first before you fish this small design not only incentivizes players to explore ocean more thoroughly it also offers a great benefit to them because of these limited but better equipments players are in no urgency to dump all the coins into upgrading their gears thus they can have some leeway how to spend their money either hiring and training better staff or expanding the farms

b2 the sheer amount of contentb
wow where do i even begin dave the diver has so much things to do fishingobviously scavenging taking photosthough not freely exploring fighting giant creatures chasing things being chased by other things managing a restaurant hiring staves for higher quality serving drinks and sushi decorating assisting chef contests helping the vip quests feeding cat stealthily following said cat fishfarming farmingactually keeping chickens keeping a virtual pet playing music game browsing through the games equivalent of ig helping the local marine magazine playing in an underwater casino seahorseracing riding a pink beluga resisting the urge to shove the grenade launcher up a certain sea persons rear stealthily avoiding zombie sea people infiltrating a secret base sling shooting a turtle playing it takes two on your own fighting a fanatic multiple times shooting missiles at a giant ancient sea creature arcadeshooting the list goes on and on

b3 other complimentsb
lovely pixelated art style
very catchy tunes
some scenes in the game are magnificent
the icon of each dish looks tasty
weapons have various upgrade path
each employee has a unique cooksta post

h1things i dislike about dave the diverh1

b1 not enough randomized layoutb
the first time i saw them ingame dialogue describing blue hole as everchanging i was expecting the layout would be randomized i was disappointed to find out that the scale of randomization is way too small in my play through it is always the same three terrainsa ravine a plain and a corral cliff for the first area theres actually a fourth one kelp forest but for some reason it never spawn over two times for me in an ingame month the situation does not improve since the second and the third region barely randomized at all i think i know the reason behind this in order to keep the important areas easy to reach the layout cannot be randomized too drastically or else the players would have a hard time finding the right place before emptying the oxygen tank i wish after the main story concluded the game could generate more interesting or dare i say chaotic layout to make repeated runs more refreshing

b2 other complaintsb
melee weapons and hook should also have crafting and upgrading menu
not enough interesting charms to play around
why does it cost so much to max out a staffs level
i wish you could refight the bosses to get more of their meats

中文小簡評
這大概是最頂的工作模擬二合一遊戲
起初我還滿疑惑這遊戲為何會這麼紅整體看起來和其他同類型沒啥兩樣等我親自玩了之後才逐漸了解
極讚的點陣圖和好聽的音樂
海底場景描繪得非常壯麗
令人上癮的玩法配上多采多姿的特色和小遊戲讓人愛不釋手
有趣的故事風趣的動畫非常有個性的npc多樣的任務新鮮度不減反增
值得一提dave the diver的每一輪工作有個小巧思玩家可以先搜刮散落海床的武器箱再開始捕魚因為這些裝備等級肯定會比初始裝備好玩家不只能更有效率的抓魚也無需急著升級武器和裝備能夠將錢運用在其他地方
料理的圖標看起來很好吃
武器有多樣升級
遊戲內有類ig的應用程式可以看看客戶和主廚的po文
或許是為了確保重要地區生成固定地圖隨機生成的幅度不大
近戰武器和魚叉應該要有各自的製造升級路線
護符數量過少特別的護符也不多
員工升滿級所需的錢真的太多了
希望boss可以重打刷食材

i love it you can play at your own pace theres no pressure whatsoever this makes it the perfect relaxing game filled with mini games exploration a nice story and light rpg elements upgrading itemssushi bar etc its an addictive game with a relaxing and fun atmosphere in wich you can sink many hours

#####

foreword i do not really write reviews but i felt compelled to do so here

i have lost that positive and exciting glow that video games exuded that feeling that once held me captivated especially when i was younger somewhere between all the discourse that floods the gaming industry i could go on and on here unfulfilled promises from aaa publishersstudios incomplete games that are listed full price nearly all multiplayer based games switching to a battlepass or other form of paid live service or outrightly lying to consumers my faith for gaming has rotten into cynicism and resentment 

this game however made me forget all of that negativity and laziness giftwrappedinsideofgreed its really entirely unique in what it sets out to accomplish ive played many other oceanesque style games or storetavernfarm type simulators that have partial rpg undertones this game takes the funnest parts of those genres and collaborates them into something really different and new and i seriously cannot get enough of it 

it does this consistently and seems to always deliver something new each time you complete a daycycle ingame and at some points almost too much where i felt only slightly overwhelmed not in a bad way any time that a thought like this is great but if they added this crossed my mind it delivered it so far ive counted around five or six times the story had depth and is interesting and is also consistently building onitself throughout your playthru what is this feelings in a game is this hope i smell

all of the content that it offers as you progress comes at the perfect moment and makes you feel like your accomplishing something there are some redundancies like with any other game however i never found myself bored doing the more minuscule or repetitious taskschores like collecting the same kind of fish a bunch of times or finding weapons in sunken chests 3 times so that you can unlock it to construct or going back to some really deep depth to catch another species you missed my favorite of these simply involves feeding a cat its worth it trust me

i really could just go on and on but i digress just play it give it a shot and im sure you will be pleasantly surprised and find yourself quickly sucked into the world and all that it has to offer and its a lot it gives you so much for the price its listed at and its on sale so yeah also i would love to talk about all the mechanics and what you can do in the game but i feel theyre wrapped around too many spoilers and part of the fun is just going in blind and feeling that spark that i was talking about before i can honestly say im smitten by this game and if i had to pick a favorite of 2023 this would be it and ive played just about every aaa title thats come out thus far none of those have kept me as engaged

thank you mintrocket i look forward to finishing this and playing the dlc thanks for restoring a portion of my hope in that some people in this industry still care about playability consistency and story this has felt quite complete so far constantly keeps giving and i really look forward to completing it but will likely be sad when i do

#####

this is  a vacation from games 

usually kbm but for dave  grab a controller put your feet up and just chill

#####

dave the diver is a simple game about fishing and running a restaurant

at least until you get further in the story greenpeacestyle ecoterrorists alien creatures absurd celebrities yet somehow it all remains a cohesive whole

dave the diver is a unique experience everyone should try

#####

h1 just one more dive h1

i bought this game completely on a whim because i kept seeing it advertised everywhere and saw all the glowing  reviews i went in blind not knowing much besides catch fish during day sell them at night i was expecting something with a very simple concept like moonlighter but i was pleased to see its much more than that and theres a lot to unpack here and so much to enjoy theres a lot i personally love about the game 


 the addictive gameplay of filling out essentially a fish pokedex like animal crossing 

 the satisfying loop of catching a bunch of fish selling them at the restaurant you manage and using the money to upgrade daves diving equipment so you can progress further deal more damage upgrade oxygen tank etc 

 wonderful soundtrack its got tense scores during boss fights to just more relaxing chill music while on a peaceful dive and im someone who almost never pays attention to the soundtrack in games

 even many hours in i was pleased to still be unlocking new content for example a farm to grow more crops for your dishes 

 some of the random minigames are so much fun i wasnt expecting to suddenly have to play a rhythm minigame sequence as duff the anime loving neckbeard who provides dave with weapon upgrades but it gave me a good laugh and just shook up the gameplay a bit 

 all the characters are so charming even smaller characters are so fleshed out such as a rapper named mc sammy who has a popular song called hot pepper tuna


this is one of those games where its very clear where all the hype comes from once you play it i cant recommend it enough 




#####

it good you play now

#####

you can use a golf club to beat jellyfish to death and the ecological society will reward you you can use a katana to kill a shark and then serve its entire head to your customers game of the year

#####

imagine paying 250k to see the bottom of the ocean when instead you could of just bought this

#####

i dont know if you can tell by my hours but i love this game ive been spending so much time jamming to its music finding fish to level my sushi recipes and other stuff

its funny pretty and the story is super easy some of the boss fights are hard until you figure things out i have found that some of the quests will come back around so if you dont succeed at them you can try again another time 

1010 this is a blast

#####

subnautica
we dont want guns in our game because we want players to respect the beautiful ocean

chad dave the diver
you wanna hunt tuna with an m32 grenade launcher go for it king


























#####

awesome gameplay mini game galoreyou will not and can not guess what kind of uniquely weird shenanigan going to happen next unbelievable addicting and satisfying catch and profit loop spear fishing trip swapped with base building gameplay  and countless mission just so good

too few non fish creature tho hope there more crab shellfish and lobster to catch also more non shark enemy almost every mini boss are shark should have sailfish or something like that too

#####

overhelmingly positive should be right for this game
its not too hard its fun and its addictive o and it made me laugh out loud several times because of the characters and the story its over the top beside all of that the diving is very relaxing and the game doesnt hurry you up so you can make sushi and sell it at your own tempo and upgrade your stuff before you want to go deeper into the story the upgrades are great and realy help you along deeperdiving into the game yep dave hit several of my game spots i really like sushi by the way

#####

dave the diver is an extremely diverse distinctive and captivating adventure rpg it does not stick to a specific genre and has constant surprises for players i have never played anything even remotely similar and am blown away at the amount of interesting concepts jumbled masterfully together to create the memorable experience that is dave the diver this astonishing indie is well deserving of its overwhelmingly positive rating here on steam and i am ecstatic to see it rightfully receiving its success and welldeserved recognition

you play as dave and you guessed it he is a diver dave begins diving in the blue hole which is a marine biological hotspot that provides habitat to a diverse range of aquatic life dave dives and collects marine life to be used in the accompanying sushi shop dave soon finds himself entangled in the mystery of a longforgotten sea people civilisation and will use his diving skills to discover more about them and help various other characters along the way

whilst there is a strong narrative in the game the characters are all so lovingly wacky from the animegirlobsessedgunmaking nerd to the stoic sushi chef or the vegetable loving rapper despite the crazy characters there are fantastic foundations for each of them and i adored them all

h1gameplay brief synopsis h1
as aforementioned i have never played a game with as much variation as dave the diver but i will attempt to explain the core gameplay during the day dave is able to dive into the ocean explore it collect fish via various methods pick up objects complete quests etc at night the sushi bar opens and he will help serve there this means typical cooking dash style gameplay running around clicking on food and taking it to the customer and serving drinks have to be quick though as customers do not have high patience levels dave will earn money after each sushi serving shift and this can then be used on upgrades and many other things the games pacing is absolutely fantastic despite the enormous amount of extra content that gets added later things are introduced slowly and are generally easy to understand perhaps the biggest downfall about this game is the lie i would tell myself after playing until the early hours of the morning saying one more dive then i will go to bed definitely not

budiving ub
in the beginning dave can only dive to limited depths and has restricted cargo capacity these will increase as different elements are upgraded such as oxygen tank capacity etc dave can hunt fish via a variety of methods using a harpoon to manually pull fish in or various guns and tools everything can be upgraded and there are also different types that can be added such as incendiary poison or tranquiliser bigger fish such as sharks require more effort and stronger guns and sometimes quick time events will trigger where a button must be mashed to pull in a fish while diving dave must be careful of his oxygen levels as if it runs out he will need to be rescued resulting in everything in his inventory being lost except 1 item oxygen also acts as his health and if hurt by other fishes or the environment his oxygen levels will quickly deplete there are lots of goodies to be found in exploration that can be used in crafting and also includes plenty of oxygen spots to refuel as the game progresses players will have access to further locations such as glacier waters caves and of course the deep sea each area has unique fish to be discovered with over 200 to find in total

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3030272423


bucombat ub
there is a decent amount of combat in the game including many boss fights the boss fights are all exceptionally different and vary in difficulty as said earlier guns can be crafted and upgraded to help in the battles specific fish will also automatically target dave if he gets close and these first encounters can actually be quite scary specifically with the large sharks


bucooking ub
further to the basic cooking dash style mechanics the menu must be selected daily based off the fish dave brings back from his adventures recipes must be researched additional staff can be hired décor can be purchased and later in the game even a second branch of the shop can be opened and managed each dish is priced differently usually depending on rarity and can be upgraded with special items to increase its value and tastiness  this variation from diving to serving was absolutely phenomenal and kept me addicted from the getgo 

buextras ub
i cannot possibly describe everything in this game as there is just too much and it constantly switches genre however some of the highlights include having a fish farm vip visits cooking competitions rhythm mini games managing a vegetable farm side quests taking photos of wildlife chase sequences puzzles unique segments controlling two characters at once riding a beluga whale tranquilising large sharks and using a drone to transport them back to the fish farm and so so much more the game can easily be continued after completing the story and there is enough in management style mechanics to keep you busy for hundreds of hours from collecting all of the fish to running a successful fish and vegetable farm to operating and managing your sushi employees and second branch no two dives are the same



h1visuals  soundh1
dave the diver is visually stunning utilising a combination of pixel art with 2d3d art to create a beautiful oceanic environment brimming with aquatic life seeing whales turtles and manta rays created a sense of awe within me a testament to the efficacy of the gorgeous environment

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3030272266

the soundtrack is casual yet addictive giving a laidback beach vibe but ramping up the stress during fastpaced sequences characters are not voiced but speak in a robotic monotone voice that at first i didnt like but it grew on me shortly after

as everyone else have been saying im surethe game is nice and chill with a lot of different minigames and various quests best part as a person that doesnt normally play platformers and such is that you dont have to fight most of the bossesif you dont want to fight the big crab you dont have tosame with the white shark and so on

ive always loved games about selling stuff tycoon games and games like recettear so this was right up my alleynever liked underwater games thoughbut in first person that is this game has a lovely sidescroller view where underwater enemies doesnt freak me out p  

also for the graphic style i have to say that its a beautiful game

#####

never in my life did i think pixel art sushi would look so appealing

#####

dave the diver is a lot of things and its not shocking how all the reviews are overwhelmingly positive 

you hunt and photograph fish farm fish and food unravel mysteries deep underwater and help run a sushi restaurant while it all sounds like a lot it honestly is pretty well balanced i was surprised just how much content was in the game especially with it being a 20 indie game

the basis of the game and the controls were very simple to understand yet the game still had a lot of depth to it the music was amazing and complemented the gameplay really well the visuals and graphics were full of detail and looked beautiful even for being a pixellike style

the characters and the cutscenes are the best part in my opinion from an animeobsessed gun maker to cooking competitions between chefs the cutscenes are just chefs kiss i took so many screenshots because of dumb funny or cool visuals

there was also an assortment of boss fights and underwater puzzles that kept the game interesting there are a ton of different weapons to craft and also a bunch of unique weapons you can find while exploring
i cannot stress enough just how much stuff is packed into this little game

few small things i didnt like 
 the mouse icon isnt at all themed towards the game while this sounds like something so minimal and it is tbh it sticks out like a sore thumb compared to all of the amazing art and details that the game has
 there werent a lot of graphic settings i kept getting some tearing and unfortunately there was no vsync option you can basically only change the resolution not a huge deal but having options is always nice
 for how much content is in the game it can feel a bit repetitive at times its a constant gameplay loop of checking all your farms diving running the restaurant etc that eventually gave me burnout but that may have just been because i was 100ing the game

it probably took me around 30hrs to beat and 57hrs to 100 
 
i highly recommend this game to anyone who likes adventure and restaurant management gamessims its a great game to just relax and chill out on

#####

the game is surprisingly awesome and addictive loved the humor as well i think its very enjoyable for anyone who is down for a chill game with a solid gameplay loop they keep it fresh by introducing lots of new systems and mini games throughout the story lost track of time while playing it

h1bdave the diverbh1
idave the diveri is a casual adventure game that focuses on diving in the ocean and catching fish whilst having some light rpg elements to it

bstoryb

the player jumps into the role of dave who has to supply his sushi restaurant with fish during the day and sells the freshly caught fish as sushi by night 

during each dive you are tasked to find a few things or you encounter side quests while following the main quest that leads the player deeper and deeper into the ocean of the blue hole

bpersonal noteb

the gameplay loop of diving during the day and selling sushi by night is pretty simple but soon after your first handful of dives the gameplay loop changes a bit  sure you still need to dive and catch fish to ensure that your sushi restaurant runs well but you will encounter bosses and challenges ahead that makes the game a bit harder

the progression system in the game feels natural since you unlock more gadgets and recipes by following the main story and by simply playing the game without feeling the need to grind to get certain gadgets or upgrades

i personally wasnt sure if i would enjoy playing the game at first and saw a streamer play it and i bought it soon after 

idave the diveri has something unique to it the cutscenes are amazing the references to other things are good the gameplay loop is simple but rewarding and most importantly its a fun game and certainly one of the more surprising releases of 2023 iif you consider that it was available in early access at the end of 2022i

h1  david the diver  h1

let me start this off by saying that i was never fully expecting to love this game as much as i did this game provided so many laughs for me and almost a tear was shed at the end just because i loved the sheer experience that this game created for me i feel like no game will be able to replicate the feeling i had for idave the diveri 

idave the diveri can be whatever game you want it to be it contains something for every kind of player do you want to chill and just catch fish do it want to collect blueprints and make different weapons to kill sharks with do it do you want to manage a sushi restaurant do it want to collect fish pokemon style do it the game is what you make of it

i adored this game from start to finish the countless activities to participate in overwhelmed me in the best way possible and kept surprising me with how many minigames and endless content there are separate from the main story bill talk a little bit about the minigames but if you dont want spoilers dont hover over this next bit of textb spoilerthere is a little farming game that you will eventually encounter to be able to grow rice carrots eggplants etc to unlock more complex dishes at bancho sushi and it just added something to the game that i didnt really expect eventually you will also unlock chickens and you can harvest eggs for other dishes one of the other minigames that i lowkey loved was a mobile app that gets added towards the middle of the game that is quite literally tamagotchi and i adored it you had to take care of a virtual fish and feed it clean its poop play with it train it etc you even have to turn the lights off on your phone at night so it sleeps well lol  it added something extra to do every day and i really enjoyed that these little details in the game just really made me love the game even more because it provided a bit more content and it wasnt even content that felt like a chore to do they were fun cute and never felt annoying to partake in every day theres so much more extra content in the game if i talked about every single one of them this review would quickly become a college dissertation just trust me when i say its amazingspoiler

the cutscenes were possibly one of my favorite bits about this entire game every cut scene left me smiling laughing my ass off or taken aback at how pretty they weresometimes all three of these feelings simultaneously it definitely feels like a lot of work went into the cutscenes and it provided such a unique experience for the player im not even kidding one cutscene had me fing dying laughing

there are numerous collectibles throughout the game even a pokemonesque mini game where you collect one of every fish in every zone its actually kind of hard to complete some fish are hard to find eventually you even get to collect special unique fish for someone these fish are super rare and some are pretty difficult to catch as they will require certain weapons to capture them but ive found collecting them to be particularly fun and challenging if youre an achievement hunter this would be a great game to add to your list as its not too easy but still challenging to 100 as far as replayability idave the diveri does hold replay value for certain scenes or achievements if you failed them the first go around but most achievements are obtainable through your first playthrough there arent multiple endings to work towards

all in all do i recommend this game absolutely 1000 times yes it gave me such a beautiful experience that i was not fully expecting when first playing this game and im so glad that i completed this game i definitely plan on going back and trying to 100 it you can continue your playthrough after you finish the game which is really nice for achievement hunters and for anyone who just wants to keep playing anyway thanks for reading i hope this helps if you were on the fence about purchasing have a fantastic day

this game got me through a really dark place in my life i lost my job spouse and home in less than a year i would chop wood and fish when i couldnt find the energy to do anything else and fall asleep on the couch listening to the background music but when i played dave the diver first time my whole life changed the little successes i had were the catalyst i needed to think maybe i could have little successes again in life too highly recommend thank you for making this game

#####

i bought this game 11 hours ago

#####

worlds most athletic fat guy simulator

#####

i love dave

#####

after 40 hours and 100 completing this early access game i can say that its one of the most fun ive played i keep playing even though there is nothing left to do and there is no more fish to catch because it is still enjoyable after my life feels so meaningless now i eat sushi in the darkness and play the same overpriced fps in hopes that the full game releases soon  

amazing  5 stars  1010 





#####

im 55 hours in so far and this game is really great the art style is fantastic the cut scenes have an afro samurai vibe which looks incredible the game play is well balanced with a great mix of mini games and story quests which break up the main gameplay of supplying the sushi restaurant with fresh fish the story has me hooked ha the game feels very polished and finished despite it just releasing in early access which is refreshing compared to other early access games on steam my only complaint is i wish the game had ultra wide support but that is a very very minor complaint

#####

you may think this game is just diving catching fish and running a sushi restaurant but its not its so much more than that its an experience with surprises around every corner this game combines different elements that somehow seamlessly fit and makes sense 

its management fun storytelling satisfying  addictive gameplay boss battles collecting minigames upgrading exploration relaxing  sometimes terrifying combat not to mention the stunning combination of 2d  3d pixel art

an absolute gem made with immaculate detail  love

#####

this better get dave of the year

#####

this game works perfectly on steamdeck

#####

found a jar of mayonnaise 60m under the sea

#####

loved it i am almost to scared to finish it cause then what what do i play next that will compare

super cool game

#####

every once a while a game like this come along and hitting all the perfect spots  awesome mechanics story and gamplay

#####

its a good game that has a lot of charm and personality i like the tone setting soundtrack characters etc and its all very visually pleasing with its art style however the more i play it the more i realise its not my type of game the further i progress its leaning more and more into the stardew valley sim type of gameplay more and more fetch quests and its starting to feel more grindy so im calling it quits but i absolutely loved the time i put into it though i can recommend it to anyone whos a fan of management sim type games

#####

this is a very cute addictive and stylish game with a lot of potential my only complaint is that progression in this game seemed too quick for a restaurant management game with the gameplay loop being as satisfying as it is i think the game would benefit from slower progression allowing the players to just relax explore and enjoy their time working towards the growth of their restaurant slowing the progression of the game down coupled with enhancements to the procedural generation of the game so that it feels more varied on each dive i would very much like to see 

overall this game has a lot of potential i fell in love with the gameplay design music and style i just wish that progression was slower so that i could spend more time just diving cooking and managing my business

#####

these dives arent gonna dave themselves buy the game

i thought this game couldnt get any more fun and then i realized it was still only in early access

#####

im surprised devolver digital didnt get hold of this one first delightful game okay fine i havent played it my partner actually racked up the hours on this whilst im playing totk heres her review as a new gamer
 i can choose to avoid fighting if its too hard
 i like finding new fish
 sushi store is a welcome break and nice little minigame
 upgrading my equipment feels cool
 jellyfish suck
 babe i killed that fucking shark ahahaha

#####

this is a fun little game about diving in the ocean exploring the depths then savagely murdering every creature in sight as a sacrifice to the gods of capitalism   

the atmosphere is quite nice characters and creatures are done in a pretty good looking pixel art format the soundtrack is quite pleasant and generally fits the themes and moods  theres plenty of little mini games events and gameplay variety to keep things fresh beyond the loop of jump in kill fish make money and overall i found the game engaging all the way through until the end of the early access chapters  just about every cutscene is worth watching at least once  theyre incredibly stylish and good for a chuckle 

the game makes a big deal about using procgen environments and that every dive is different but i honestly didnt see much of that   creature spawns are more or less static and the areas themselves rarely change their layout beyond small superficial things  it doesnt really take away much from the gameplay loop itself and i probably wouldnt have even thought about it if the game didnt make such a big show about calling it out in the first place 

my biggest complaint is the controls   theyre quite clunky to the point that id say the #1 cause of dying for the time i played this was due to some kind of control mishap  it baffles me a bit that in a game about being underwater and more or less free from the idea of gravity that your aim is locked in to  45 degrees horizontally with no way to aim any higher or lower without awkwardly repositioning poor dave in the midst of having his butt chomped off by an angry shark  the choice to require a button press to begin aiming the weapon with a totally separate button to actually fire neither of which is terribly responsive can be equally frustrating in more dangerous moments   

adding to that frustration is dying during a boss fightevent section commits the mortal sin of making you rewatch all the unskippable cutscenesintros every single time you restart it  please a skip button   i beg you 

i do hope the world generation and control issues get polished up before the game releases but even if they dont this is still worth a play if youre in to the vaguely roguelite gameplay loop and exploration stuff

#####

no need to wait for a discount for this game

trust me this game gives so much than what its worth

the passion and experimentation is seen throughout this whole game and just takes me back to a time where games are not afraid to go away from a simple core mechanic just to have you do something else that gets you into wanting more of things to discover and enjoy 

simple premise

tons of things to do

witty readable dialogue

and wacky plots you cant get enough of

you wont regret it

i thought dredge was the best indie game i played this year but dave the diver is just as good if not better without a doubt dave the diver has tons more content than dredge with just so much to do that it feels like a steal to buy it at full price all main and side quests are exciting to complete and the mechanics of building up your gear fishery restaurant farm etc is fun and not a chore

with both dave the diver and dredge being in the dredging  diving bundle on sale right now i would definitely recommend getting both in the bundle theyre both different games that complement each other well with crossovers too if they dont win this years steam awards in their respective categories then the voting is surely rigged

#####

out of 1144 games in my library this is the only game i have 100 achievements i havent been this obsessed with a game since pokemon redblue came out hits nostalgia in the g spot too

there is a ton to do already for ea very few bugs and the few i ran into were not even an annoyance very minor got fixed very very quickly the devs are eager to please their players 

i recommend this game to everyone buy it you wont regret it



#####

yes definitely play it enormous amount of fishing fun the sushi is a pleasant reprise and you can farm some fish so you dont have to spend everyday fishing you can discover the sea people or battle a shark bottom line is ive had great fun playing

#####

in the approximately 15 years that ive been on steam with around 273 games in my library i think this is the first time ive ever done a review   it is super chill and enjoyable   the story and characters are great theres always a sense of getting better and evolving your various endeavors  its also beautiful  i would highly recommend the dredge crossover dlc as its very good as well  it may be my most favorite game despite the fact that i am usually drawn to rpg and shooter genres this game absolutely slaps 5 stars

bh1dave the diverh1b
b one more dive and its 2 amb


bh1the game in a nutshellh1b
dave the diver is a pixelart management actionadventure dive by day and run a sushi bar in the evening apart from managing your staff enobling your interior collecting ingredients and obviously hunting fish for your menu card which you change daily depending on your hunting success this game offers much more but ill try to keep it as spoilerfree as possible  it needs to be experienced the gameplay loop though is highly addictive and once you think youve seen it all the game surprises you with another possibility to expand your business another activity as eg mini games or one of its genious and charming cutscenes that introduce the next story or continue a previous


bh1h1b
 beautifully designed  art style atmosphere and musicsounds perfectly work together  
 explore the ocean and decide what itll be on todays menu
 lovable characters with amusing interactions
 hilarious cutscenes and humor in general
 many pop culture references  
 manage your todos crafting social media and more with apps on your ingame cellphone 
 time events that are always managable
 very polished for an ea game 
 as mentioned the gameplay loop is highly addictive  18 hours in three days says it all 
 several storylines all of which intertwine beautifully 
 end bosses for some of the quests and stories
 easy 100 for those who care about achievements


 although the game uses procedurally generated environments most of the areas repeat themselves  i hope that this feature will be strengthened in future updates for more variety during the dives


 the only negative for me is the qte parts that appear when you try catching some of the high tier fish but that depends on and minimizes when you get better gear the reason behind is just a skill issue  as an older gamer my reflexes are in a downward spiral and i totally suck at qte


bh1conclusionh1b
although its just january 2023 this already is personal goty material and there is a reason for the overwhelmingly positive rewievs it has dave the diver still is in early access and im thrilled for its upcoming content and since were talking about a food related game id like to mention that a good meal and in this case the game itself is the outcome of the right mix of ingredients passion and invested love for every step of the work and that you can feel in every single corner of the game the attention to detail is truly amazing this game is so good and entertaining that time really runs and i had to force myself to go to bed highly recommended if youre looking for something unique that already is a masterpiece in its current ea state

#####

what is this one of the best games i have played dont let the pixel graphics fool you this game has a lot of gameplay elements and story in it 
you are a diver during the day and have to explore the sea to catch fish find treasure and react to any sudden situations you basically have an oxygen meter to determine how long you can stay under the sea it is also your hp meter if you are hurt you will lose some oxygen when you are out of air you will be saved and taken back to your ship but you can only retrieve one item
for any fish or sea creature you caught you sent to your restaurant for it to open for the night you have a restaurant management mini game which you have to design the menu from what you caught in the morning or from previous days leftover manage your staff and serve your customers repeat the next day the good thing about this game is that there are alot of side missions and quests for you to tend to during your undersea adventure i wont get into too much detail here but there are still new stuff unlocking after 10 hours of play time 

anyways here is a quick summary of pros and cons of this game
pros
 lots of gameplay elements
 multiple storylines
 loveable characters and main protagonist
 relaxing but occasionally gives you a sense of danger and make you fight for your life

cons
 some quality of life changes needed 
eg1 the drink pouring minigame continues for like 5 seconds even after you finished pouring and locks you out from doing other stuff and if you dont entertain them they get angry and leaves b update spoiler turns out you can train your staff to supply drinks so they deliberately makes you suffer at first to make you appreciate your upgrades more spoiler b

eg2 no game loading unless you go back to the main menu you either make it entirely impossible to load or you allow us to easily load please b update still no load game and only 3 auto saves need to rely on altf4 in order to preserve auto saves otherwise they will be easily overwritten b

eg3 claims the map is randomly generated but there are only a few variations with the same layout so you will get familiar with them over time b update no change a bit disappointed to be honest but not a deal breaker b
 strike still in early access makes you wanting for more okay not really a con but man i want the full game so badly strike full game has released

hrhr
update after beating the full release

so it has been a few months and i have put in 30 more hours to complete the game this game still holds and manage to give me enjoyment from start to end makes me wanting for more though i can say there are two different meaning of completion with this game most people would end it after clearing the main story and probably after getting all achievements this requires around 3040 hours i had a bug so i had to go and replay parts of the game again for one final achievement and then there are the 100 completion crew to get 100 completion eg all dishesstaffweapons upgraded i can see you will probably need another 3040 hours the gap in between finishing the game and 100 the game is colossal i would love to 100 the game normally but the great effort required made me gave it up i am sure some people would love this and the game company actually gave you a choice by not forcing any achievements on that is great just make sure you note this

some notes worth mentioning
 released some other qol changes that removes the button mashing from the game this wasnt a problem in my original review because i was playing with mouse and keyboard at first during full game i tried playing with a controller and that was where the problem comes in but the devs listened to the community and added accessibility options to simply have you hold the buttons so finally no more button mashing

 upgrade cost for staff for the final 5 levels are crazy materials required for the final few levels of dish upgrades are also crazy in general the climb is very steep near the end for each staffdish upgrade while the return on investment is the same as before

 occasional bugs still exist normal but still happened too often and had to mention or not unlocking achievements

#####

this is what pc gaming is all about

#####

do you like fishing restaurant management pokemon snap stardew just play this game its charming and cute and fun

#####

just one more dive and then ill go to bed

one of the most addicting games i have ever played the fishing can be as calm and relaxing or as intense as you want it to be and the restaurant always feels fulfilling very excited for the full release

#####

since ive gotten a bit older i only play a little a day as my brain gets fried trying to keep up with everyting going on i usually play on console as my joints are deformed and it makes playing on the computer painful at times that being said
i started this game at 7pm and stopped playing only because adulting dictated i needed to at 345am i was having a blast each time i was like ok ill complete this and then do go to bed but a special event happened or i got a new upgrade there is so much content for early access how much will there be for the whole game if its any indication its got to be a big game im really looking forward to playing more and for the full release hopefully our progress will be saved and added with full release but honestly if not im game to replay as far as the graphics and game play i did run into 2 issues only 2 bugs for an early release is damn good bringing your phone out will sometimes cause a red and black screen ive had that happen 3 times in almost 9 hours of game play i started the dive and my character never showed up in the ocean that happened once so 4 bugs in 9 hours for early access is amazing also for those who are a fan of food wars it does have some vibes with the vips thats all ill say
happy fishing

#####

i am in love and in awe of this game worth every penny and more the entire game is a delight and dave is so precious

#####

in dave the diver you play as dave who is not just a diver but also a managerserver at a restaurant and a farmer of both plants and fish  the core game play loop is dave diving to collect fish and managing your restaurants menu  within the game youll also explore the depths of the as of current two ocean maps complete various quests given to you by a host of unique and fun characters manage your restaurant by hiringtraining staff and overseeing your fishrice farm  

the game starts you exploring a small portion of a what it calls a constant changing pocket of the ocean again only two maps as of now wherein after learning the controls youll become a server in the restaurant slowly opening up more game play as you progress

things done well in my opinion
 the core game play loop is enjoyable
 theres a lot to do in the game
 the nps are silly entertaining and the dialog is fairly well written
 animations are over the top and a joy to watch skippable after repeated viewings
 the oxygen as health bar mechanic adds a nice level of tension to the game

what needs work in my opinion
 theres a delay in trying to rapid fire your speargun thats annoying and makes fighting fast moving fish annoying
 it has the mario mechanic where simply touching an enemy damages you when fighting larger fish this can be very annoying as the tail or fins will destroy you in close combat
 fish can get inside your hit box wherein youre unable to repel them  if youre heavy this can outright kill you as youre unable to escape
 it would be nice to be able to change the music around and set it to different locations  as it is now you can listen to any of the music you unlocked in the game on your phone but thats all you can do with it

overall dave the diver is quite a fun game and i would recommend it to others

#####

i dont usually leave reviews but i just had to this game goes above and beyond to make each second engaging and fulfilling super cozy and relaxing but never boring the combat is intuitive the menus are easy to navigate learning about and collecting different fish feels satisfying and everything looks super charming all the time i usually struggle to relate to characters that i dont have anything in common with but it doesnt even matter because dave is so sweet and its impossible not to love him 1010 game

#####

this game is utter perfection

it has it all diving fishing harpooning sushi selling customer serving wasabi refilling rhythm beating strikepokestrike fishmon collecting tamagotchi raising boss fighting seed farm simming fish farm simming hiring manager simming restaurant managing and more there is even a really fun dredge cross over

it is a total 10 hot pepper tunas out of 10 

i could only wish this game was longer or that there may be a sequel one day

#####

game with a soul
you can feel it is made with love
very enjoyable

#####

callmekevin played this and made me wanna buy this i will say as a caveat but generally seems like a wonderful restaurant managerdiving game as far as i have played quality indie game 

#####

as somebody here said dave the diver and elden ring are the best games ive ever played

updated review after completing the story in the early access
this is a must play that it is even better than i thought it to be the game allows you to free roam after the main story and it has loads of awesome mini games

one of a kind
this is the sign that you needed to get it reader dont miss this masterpiece

#####

okay lets do the opposite of what the game does here and get straight to the point

relaxing and enjoyable at the start the game initially sets a great tone
however as you progress it gets increasingly tedious more and more shallow mechanics get thrown at you so that about 10 hours in you start feeling as if youre playing some weird amalgamation of a flashy mobile game and mmo fetch quest fiesta and start thinking what are you doing with your time fish farming crop farming each day becomes a maaassive chore

with other games of this type the realization comes to you right away while this one tricks you and sucks 1020hours off you before it shows its nature

it aint bad per say but gets more praise than what its worth

#####

you might say to yourself  how can i possibly lose dozens of hours in a game revolving around running a sushi restaurant and for under 20

i cant stress enough how incredible this game is i ran out of positive adjectives to say about this game due to me trying to express my profound love for what exists its like climbing up your favorite hill only to realize its a mountain but not only is it a mountain but the largest mountain on earth  only to reveal that its bigger than that the audacity of this game to be this good and so surprising and refreshing for so long borders on illegal 

this game is everything you expect and then tons and tons of things you dont expect  all of them fantastic and capable of being their own game hours into this immersive game more and more things are being unlocked every random tangent you swim on or cook leads you down a rabbit hole of other tangents and unlocks 

this is my game of the year and slowly creeping its way into my game of the last 5 years you will lose mountains of time 

and to finally get you to slam that add the cart button  you can pet a baby whale 

hope you have some free time

#####

you should dive with dave

#####

how addictive is this game
well i just spent more than 200 hrs in 1 month for this game

#####

scratched that stardew itch while simultaneously being its own game completely very relaxing with great upgrade goals to work towards and unlock 

i thought the sushi bar would be unnecessary game play but it actually works really really well

thats a buy from me

#####

oh my god i love fish
fish are so cool i love them so much
squids marine mammals crustaceans i lvoe theam somuch

#####

this game is incredibly wellpaced its not even a single game to be honest but rather a wide range of minigames that keep piling on without overwhelming you you start off diving catching fish and making sushi from it  and end up grinding approval for a new faction doing seahorse racing fighting bosses growing rice and more more more the best feature of idave the diveri is just how gradually these new features are introduced

its fun very welldesigned and rarely punishes you  not severely anyway

it also doesnt add anything to well anything

it doesnt have new ideas or aesthetics or emotions its not trying to say anything it only exists for the sole purpose of having you have some pleasant time 

and theres absolutely nothing wrong with that  except that when i closed idave the diveri i realized it left no impression on me it was like swimming in warm water  nice in the process completely forgettable after

#####

h1look at this giant blue hole ive never seen anything like thish1

bdave the diverb has impressed me in many ways with what this game has to offer due to the amount of content it has presented the developers at bmintrocketb really have outdone themselves in terms of making one of the best casual games out there i was given this game as a gift from a friend of mine and i am really glad they provided this to me because it is a ton of fun

h1pros and consh1
bprosb
list
a charming story with quirky characters
very fun underwater diving gameplay where you collect fish
the restaurant management was my favorite part of the game
side quests that will give you useful rewards
actual fun quick time events
beautiful pixel art style that i love
list

bconsb
list
boss fights felt very underwhelming
melee combat is very bad
list

h1storyh1
the game starts out with bdaveb who is a diver he receives a call from his friend bcobrab who asks him for help in starting a sushi restaurant with bchef banchob the location is at the sea known as bthe blue holeb a spot that contains all the fish from all over the world and constantly changes each time you enter it this would have been bthe all blueb for bsanjib from bone pieceb as a matter of fact i think he and bbanchob would have gotten along just fine except the part about wasting food

the story of bdave the diverb is very charming all the characters are fun with each having something special about them that makes them stand out from each other my favorite one has to be bbanchob i just love how he does his cooking and just how devoted he is to his craft this reminds me of bgordon ramseyb in some ways and bgordon ramseyb even makes a cameo in the game which is something i loved

h1gameplayh1
now for the gameplay i have a lot to explain but i will try and be brief on everything because both the main gameplay mechanics could fill a section of their own the main thing you will be doing in the game is diving for fish this is done with a harpoon gun proper firearms traps and melee weapons although murdering your pray is not the best way to go with the harpoon gun you do have to pull the fish in which the game will sometimes do for you other times a variety of quicktime events may be thrown at you you can come across a lot of diverse types of fish for you to collect and all of them can be served to customers

you are vulnerable when reeling a fish in so when you have multiple aggressive ones coming at you the gun would be a good thing to use you can upgrade all of your weapons with the firearms having different elemental specializations available the harpoon gun can also gain effects however only through finding temporary harpoon tip in loot during diving with the bidiverb app on your phone you can also upgrade your other gear like diving suit inventory space and oxygen supply you do have a limit to what you can carry and if you go over the weight limit you will start to swim slower you can carry a bit more but your inventory will eventually get too full and you will be unable to carry anything else keeping an eye on your oxygen is also key because if you run out it will be a game over and you will only be able to salvage a single item or fish upon being rescued

at nighttime you will be running a sushi restaurant with bbanchob where you must deliver food or drinks to customers the menu is completely up to you and you can use the fish that you have captured in the bblue holeb you can even hire different people to help you run the restaurant these people can also be trained and will get special skills or unlock special recipes your employees come with four different stats which influence the role they are efficient in you can get promotions which is handled by your internet fame on bcookstab and unlocks new menu slots for each night alongside other benefits the restaurant portion of the game is my favorite thing to do although i feel that this is more of a side thing in the later parts of the game due to the story that the game has which i did not go too into because i dont want to spoil it
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3165524343 
you can make bbanchob go into cookoffs with different chefs for which the gameplay will turn into bcooking mamab for a bit these will also open up some side quests or other features that you can use to help run your restaurant there are a lot of side quests for you to do and the rewards for them are fantastic from people who will come in and request a certain dish to you having to go out and take a photo of a special fish there is just so much to this game its amazing and i love it i even liked doing the quick time events that the game had which is something i thought i would never say

there are even a few minigames or special events you can do as well one of them makes you take part in an idol concert and i wish you had more opportunities to play this event again they even made an entire animated music video for the sequence as well

although bdave the diverb has two issues that i must go over that i did have a problem with the first issue has to be the boss fights feeling very underwhelming they mainly made you play keep away for the most part yet your weapons force you to go up to them the gun has a decent range but the stock one you get has some very lackluster damage in the later parts of the game unless you put upgrades into it but they can get pretty expensive and you will only make a certain amount of money a night i did mention that the game has a ton of side content and they can help you make money you just have to commit yourself to the whole thing the other issue is that since you are underwater your movement is also rather limited  the enemys however is not plus some of the bosses can get pretty big so you may have to try and avoid one in a small space with not a lot of room for error

melee combat is also another issue and i am really glad that its not something you have to do in boss fights the knife you have is just outright bad it does poor damage although you can upgrade it it can do stuff like mine for materials that only the pickaxe can mine and the damage can increase on it but these upgrades are not until a little later into the game your melee attack with it is just awful and the hitbox for it is very bad there are other melee weapons you can use and you are just better off using those than the default knife and even then i would still advise to not use your melee attack on enemies that are problematic the only fish that wont be an issue to use it on are ones who just dont attack and are slow at swimming

h1graphics and performanceh1
the pixel art style that the game uses is absolutely beautiful bthe blue holeb is a very mysterious place at times but the scenery is just breathtaking i tested the game on an nvidia geforce gtx 1060 3gb amd ryzen 5 1500x quadcore processor 350 and 16 gb of ram i had no issues with the game and it runs perfectly on lowend pcs and it ran very well on my steam deck

h1final verdicth1
bdave the diverb was a pleasant surprise providing lots of content that is sure to entertain anyone who decides to play it the animations are also something i should praise as well they look exceptionally smooth and are just wonderful to look at when they are shown the game is 2599 cdn and i think its worth the price for the amount of content provided in this title

3 times over worth the price packed with content tons of nods and pop culture references just finished the game but i am looking forward to play more graphics are adoable 710 and animations are surprisingly complex and cute 910 game play 910 music 710 1010 looking at the track hot pepper tuna best credit sequence in a long while amazing how they managed to balance punishment for greed with rewards for progression beating the main story boss was super gratifying and left me wanting to play the past credits content even more i have not played the full game before the big patch only demo but in this state the game is incredibly good

#####

no game should be this good ive stayed up til 5 am playing a game about diving it really says something about it the gameplay is fun and i love the quirky cutscenes i def recommend checking this game out

edit this has been on all my steam nominations hope you win 2023

#####

by far one of the most complete early access titles to date

yes the main content is locked for the official title release but the amount of extra side content blows it out of the water hehe see what i did there compared to other early access titles
a lot of side content to enjoy after youve caught up on all the main content
im 17 hours in maxed out on several upgrades but have not hit the content ceiling just had a few additional contents unlock

for approx 25  30 even at early access you are getting your moneys worth

#####

can i dive in dave tho

#####

bravo six going dive

#####

i wish there was a neutral vote option in this case since i normally dont down vote games in a review

to start off with the characters and atmosphere is great super highquality and you can tell there was a lot of love put into the development of the game the fishing mechanics are fun and theres a nice sense of progression as you start to unlock things

but for me this is where the fun stops to sum it up it gets very very tedious

as you progress it keeps adding more and more things to do time limited restaurant events vip encounters multiple overlapping sidequests and optional objectives many collection based challenges via the smartphone apps etc the list goes on

all of these can be done on any of the ingame days but you only have 2 later 3 dives per day to accomplish these to reinforce that this is the intended core game play loop they introduce ways to obtain fish without needing to go fishing for them later when you have a garden they once again add automatic ways to manage it the game knows it all takes a lot of time to do things to the point they automate it but then it feels like more things get tacked on and before you know it the fishing element of the game is only used to deal with hostile creatures as you get from point a to point b

short fun and relaxing dives went from 5 minutes to upwards of 1520 minutes often times most of what youll be doing is swimming but very slowly as you make your way to key locations to complete an objective sure you can ignore these and have fun fishing but youll be halting story progress

while i love some of the game i cant recommend this for someone who just wants a nice chill game to play before or after work the escapism quickly dissolves leaving you with a drawn out and tedious experience that feels more like work rather than play while this is fun for some its definitely not what i was expecting going into this

id give it a chance if you have the time to invest and like the slower pace the game delivers itself with id give it a 610 lovable characters presented in a fun world and a nice chill atmosphere despite the less chill game play loop id honestly recommend it for the characters alone but its a hard sell for me just on the tediousness as i cant guarantee someone might enjoy it enough through the slow parts to see where their stories go

big man big dreams small sushi bar

#####

excuse my grammar mistakes in advance english is not my first language

dave the diver is a fun game with roguelite elements 
good playful music and a simple but cute story
the game will keep you busy with these two main objectives

 run the sushi restaurant with the owner
 explore and scavenge this mysterious lakesea near the restaurant and catch food for the restaurant

the game does a great job of alternating the tasks listed above it keeps the game refreshing and light and makes me look forward to continue the progress that ive just made its also a great game for short bursts of playing as every tasksection of the game takes about 1020 minutes and you can just save and quit after any

thank you for reading my first review 
i hope it provided some insights that helped in your decision to buy the game or not
so would i recommend it  yes dave the diver is a great game to spend your free time on

#####

this is the single best rougelite ive ever played and its not even close dave the diver combines the beauty of some of the most relaxing game play with beautiful visuals incredibly funny dialogue and characters and so so so much side content that ive unironically spent more time doing that than i have progressing the main story you can beat this game in roughly 12 ish hours if you were just pushing for main story objectives but the insane amount of side content and extra achievements and optional content including optional boss fights will easily have you playing for 3540 hours minimum the games two main gameplay loops of diving for fish and working at the sushi resturant perfectly go hand in hand and the more you play the game the more youll actually want to just be swimming around underneath the ocean doing basically nothing but catching wildlife fighting sharks helping people with sidequests theres just an absurd amount of content here this game could be 150 of hell even 200 of its current price on steam and id still say its worth it this is a fucking gem of a game and youre seriously missing out if you arent playing it

#####

dave the diver is a relentlessly enjoyable experience when i played the demo months ago i could tell that it was something unique and fun but i had no idea that the final product would be packed with so much content while also remaining cohesive and endearing throughout then to top it all off it has some of the most hilarious and wellmade pixel art cutscenes i have ever encountered you can stop here and just play it but if you need more convincing continue below
 
abbreviated review httpsyoutubezg2nfria_w8
 
h1meet daveh1
the innocuous beginning of dave the diver makes it seem like youre in for a runofthemill management sim and sidescrolling shooter of some sort your protagonist dave is a seemingly mildmannered and friendly guy who takes on any task presented to him with a smile so in addition to being the sole diver hunting fish in the occasionally hostile environment of an islandencompassed blue hole youll also be managing the menu financials décor and being the primary server in the restaurant the only thing you wont be doing mostly is crafting the sushi itself  which is left to your mysterious hardnosed chef bancho
 
bancho like many of the noteworthy characters in the game has a small story that you get to explore within the gameplay character exploration is part of the larger narrative in what ultimately becomes a fairly expansive story with a lot of mysteries and discoveries within it like the blue hole itself the adventure seems basic on the surface but is actually deep and full of secrets while initially your goals are only stocking and running a restaurant various characters will wander out to meet you on the dive platform of your small boat to request your assistance in several unique and iterative quest chains some of these chains weave into the core of the story while others are just extra tasks that can provide rewards and keep the game rich
 
the money that you earn as a reward from some of these quests adds to your primary source of income  the restaurant this money can be used for many tasks and resources including augmenting the restaurant as well as upgrading your gear to dive deeper longer and with better tools to keep you alive the deeper you go the more threats youll face but youll also encounter rarer sea creatures that can be diced into more profitable dishes at the restaurant however thats only a small portion of what youll find in the depths
 
h1 the abyss h1
one interesting aspect of the journey through dave the diver is the process of unlocking the things you need to make it into new environments youll of course need more air available as its not only for breathing but also functions as your health bar any time youre stung by a jellyfish or snapped at by a shark youll lose air  while also steadily losing it as you breathe you can find barrels of that liferetaining substance randomly on the sea floor along with chests full of onetimeuse resources like underwater scooters and temporary oxygen boosts youll also find chests with new spear tips guns and melee weapons youll need to fend off and take down larger predators and prey
 
part of the unique challenge any time you dive into the ocean is that you have a sort of roguelike experience where you need to obtain stronger spears and weapons and the environment is slightly different the undersea environment isnt procedurally generated so you will see the same map over several dives but there are at least a handful of maps to navigate that change with the time of day however with the random nature of the items you obtain each time and the progressively more challenging creatures that appear as the story moves forward it feels a lot more diverse than it is
 
the chapterbased campaign is blocked out by the main quest line that uses key items to limit your overall progression while you can upgrade your oxygen and suit to go deeper as well as your harpoon and weapons to fish more efficiently even your first steps into deeper water require you to complete a quest for a headlamp you can sit around avoiding the main quest to fish endlessly and run the restaurant but the game is built around the excellent pacing that has you balancing that aspect with exploration and mystery quite well of the 25 hours it took me to finish the main part of the game i made only a handful of dives that werent connected in some way toward progression
 
 
h1riding the currenth1
 
dave the divers pacing works so well because it always gives you something new to do the number of minigames and evolving mechanics is astounding from the simplest tasks like having a different minigame for reeling in a big fish using each different spear tip to an immersive rhythmbased music challenge you can revisit at any time you will never be complacent it was almost overwhelming at times with how any given moment you could be using a mechanic you have never seen before to accomplish your next task there are entire moments crafted in the game using controls and functionality that happen a single time which almost seems wasteful if it wasnt also fun as hell
 
between the minigames boss fights everexpanding roles of spearfishing and restaurant management and the hilarious cutscenes sprinkled throughout the game i was blown away by everything presented for a mere 20 this game provided one of the best experiences ive had in an indie game in a long time and i am hoping that this isnt the end of the adventure for dave the ongoing nature of serving new dishes in the restaurant and the potential to unlock more secret caves or deeper adventures leaves plenty of room for more content however even if somehow the developers dont seize that opportunity this game is well worth picking up and diving into

i really want to like the game because it is a ton of fun besides one aspect what is ruining my experience as an older gamerdeveloper with karpaltunnel issues are the button mashing controls needed in many aspects of the gameplay it is ruining my peripheral inputs that is also why i stopped playing it on the steam deck i do not think having to mash spacebar leftmouse or a button input 20 times in a five second interval is good for your hand and wrist health
 
i wish the developers would change their approach and instead like they do it on some harpoons require a key sequence to be entered aka w a spacebar eg maybe give an option in the settings to activate sequential input mode so people can decide between button mashing or a less hardware and wristhandstraining input method

i will gladly change my review once this has been addressed or changed for now i do not recommend this game for anyone who is concerned about their peripheral health or has issues mashing the same input over and over in a short burst

edit well seems like we got heard and the devs are addressing the buttonmashing issues so i will gladly change my review to recommend the game thanks for listening to the feedback and solving the issue devs 

#####

works on steam deck 
played about 10 mins so far and it works fine on steam deck so far really happy this is working on the steam deck been looking foward to it for a while now

#####

dave the diver
can we fish it
dave the diver
no we dont have enough space in our inventory

i am but a humble feesh farmer

i usually dislike fishing minigames in other games so i had my doubts when i saw that this one was about fishing however it was a pleasant surprise how much i enjoyed the game and how entertained i was while fishing it never got tiring well except maybe taking care of the tamagotchi haha

this is a fishing game with several other interesting mechanics surprisingly for me it has a story and quite an interesting one at that with fantastic humor excellent pixel art and lets not even get started on the music this game has such great music i cant get enough of it

basically our main character dave is invited to an exotic island to try some delicious sushi but surprisingly they actually want him to go diving and by the way be a waitermanagerfarmerfish breedercard collectorphotographer and researcher among many other activities poor dave 24 hours a day are not enough

i found all the minigames very entertaining except for the tamagotchi mostly because when i was a kid i hated how much attention it demanded and the minigame reminded me of that

i think its an excellent game to relax while doing some fishing and if you like it get hooked on restaurant management lots of laughs with the cameos and references as well as the games overall sense humor i had a blast and i might even say i felt a bit sad when i finished it

i dont know what the devs are planning if they have more content in mind for the game or a sequel but im definitely looking forward to any news

highly recommended

#####

this game is excellent i have completed all achievements and its taken me around 60 hours at times where i thought gameplay was u starting u to get stale the story would progress it is such a great game with absolutely amazing pacing  its a blend of a few games

list
     farming simulation like stardew valley spoiler fisheries and farming spoiler
     restaurant operation which reminds me of overcooked blended with cooking mama
list

take those two key elements above and then add diving fishing crafting archaeology and exploration with an enjoyable combat experience side and main quest lines with constant progression all blended into one it has some of the most beautiful cutscenes and art the soundtrack is great as well all round excellent game full price you wont regret picking it up on sale is a complete steal


#####

this game is really something special it offers a fun compelling story that you can ignore for hours at a time it lets you float around the ocean depths pretty leisurely okay there is an occasional shark to be defeated or avoided but then it interrupts you at just the right time with a new gameplay mechanic or a new way to make money or an adorable side mission or a fun minigame 

i dont know that ive ever played a nonturnbased game that had more of a one more turn feeling one more dive then ill go to bed i say to myself every night and then 2 hours later ive done 4 more dives checked my fish farm completed a side quest unlocked a new recipe at the sushi restaurant and met a new character

this is also probably my favorite pixel graphics game i am not typically a fan  i lived through the 80s and 90s when bad graphics were all we had why would i want to intentionally go back to bad graphics but the art style in this game is just about perfect

the characters and writing are also great 

i dont know what else to say  try this game i dont think its for absolutely everyone but man if it clicks with you i think you will freaking love it

there hasnt been a game thats captivated me like this has in quite some time ive put close to 12 hours in and think im near the end of the early access content but i keep being surprised by new mechanics that open up theres a lot more to this game than initially meets the eye and the mechanics are rolled out slowly enough that you feel like you have firm footing at every stage of the game

so far i truly cant find fault with this the game just oozes character the art and animations are superb the music is great the mechanics are actually pretty interesting and nontrivial dont be turned off by the casual tag  there is definitely some challenge to both parts of the game at the same time theyre not super stressful  the restaurant part of the game isnt a cakewalk i rarely have a perfect night but its a far cry from something like overcooked

i havent found myself genuinely smiling or laughing at a game like i have with this in a long time to have that alongside genuinely interesting gameplay and all around good vibes is a treat definitely recommend checking this out

#####

i got this game mostly because i was bored and looking for something different  boy was i surprised by how different this game is  it has the sea exploration somewhat like subnautica but its also very much running a shop  you upgrade your gear to continue to get deeper and find newer stuff  you can upgrade your shop recipes as you continue to get more stuff  you can change the shop decoration as well as higher and level up staff of your choosing  there is a book to fill with all the different fish you find so you can complete that too  so far im very impressed and happy with this game  definitely found a gem

#####

this game has so much to offer the more you complete the more you find to do the characters are charming the story keeps getting deeper and the gameplay is addicting highly recommend

bim going to cap off my 2023 with a review of my favorite game of the year and my 99th review so i can start the brandnew year with an inaugural 100th which will hopefully be on a game i really love if i dont though maybe its okay because this 99th review of mine is on an absolute gem that really blew me away dave the diver is iinspiredi in more than one sense creative and full of little surprises this fantastic games strengths though are at the same time its greatest limitationsb

dave the diver is an unassuming little pixelart game 23gb a studio youve maybe never heard of a simplistic premise but before you know it this game really snowballs into something diverse and powerful

i will admit that upon seeing the trailer on steam now this probably shouldnt have surprised me as much as it did they certainly hold nothing back in the trailer showing almost maybe itooi much of what they have to offer if i had seen that maybe i would be less impressed alas my introduction to the game was a brief 10minute section of a urlhttpswwwtwitchtvnorthernlionnorthernlion streamurl back in the very early part of 2023 i committed to seeing no more and to get the game as soon as it went on discount again

daves foundations are robust the diving is very fun and in the very beginning your air tanks limited capacity and the weight you can carry keep you from satisfying your overwhelming thirst for just more underwater exploration and fishing that insatiable ijust one more turni feeling is profoundly present at this time the upgrade drip feed is steady and it opens up the underwater gameplay in various ways in terms of weapons you can bring and how they are best used items you can buy from cobras shop and side objectives like the ecowatcher and photo spots

at the same time the restaurant manager part of the game isnt bad but begins slow and although you can get new recipes semiregularly your ability to expand beyond just simple inigirii style sushi dishes is limited initially which for me restricted my interest in that part of the game the restaurant management is overly simplistic and just a means to an end expanding your diving capabilities

around 23 into the story however around the time you unlock the spoilersea people villagespoiler the game sort of flips the script part of this is because getting around is a little cumbersome now but also suddenly the restaurant part expands massively and provides tons of new creative approaches to the management sim the story meanwhile drags on a little long and the final two zones are far and away less exciting than the earlier ones by the end of the game although the diving is still fun in its own right the star of the show has changed

at this juncture players have now seen diving and fishing gameplay metal gear inspired stealth missions cooking mama style cooking classic restaurant simulation pokemon snap inspired photo spots 2d side scroller gameplay in two iveryi different forms gambling minigames seahorse racing rhythm minigames ace attorney stylized dialogue sequences and boss fights of varying qualities it sounds like some of this has to be out of place and even writing it now i think iman just what the hell bisb this gamei but it never feels that way in the action part of that has to be because of the simply flooring pixel art style gluing all of this together

its iflabbergastingi the variety that dave the diver throws at you it is an absolute joy to play and i thoroughly enjoyed all of the moment to moment gameplay save for a handful of boss fights which really dont work well and should have been adjusted in early access almost all of these moments are of high quality although simplistic
 
isome of themi are interesting and pleasing enough such as the photo taking and the cooking mama style gameplay for me personally that i am ialmosti more frustrated that theres not more 

band this is daves achilles heelb dave has spread itself ubso widebu and although the thin newyork slice is a classic and you can never go wrong with it there are times when you just crave that chicago deep dish experience but dave cant give you that in a lot of the ways you may wish for it some systems you cant engage with as often as you want and other systems once theyve been experienced never make a return which is baffling to me because their quality must have taken isome considerable timei to implement so well

this iisi a frustration of mine make no mistake but luckily the games foundations as i said are robust even though you want to experience more of the wacky and unique aspects of dave the diver than you are permitted what you icani do never really gets any less fun the way the game allows you to cover your bases with some very nice late game unlocksupgrades also lets you focus most on what part of the gameplay you enjoy too and this is a smash hit

overall this helped me complete dave the diver 100 a first for me in quite some time on steam and something i wish i felt compelled to do more often with games

there are some quality of life features that i am confident will be included in the future but i think i may be done with this one save for some gamechanging additions down the road but im extremely satisfied i recommend dave the diver to just about anybody and also would like to finally recognize that yeah i probably love this a little more than i ought to because of how much of a simp i am for underwater themes

the pacing of it all
 the story
 the rate of feature unlocks
 the upgrade system
this is what good game design feels like

cant wait for the full release

#####

relaxing and great on steamdeck

#####

man why cant dave get some respect hes the real mvp

#####

everything that i really want in a video game

exploration 
management 
interesting story to engage with 
addictive 

i really love how the developer has put a lot of details in every aspect of the game 
i wish there were other games that could explore other themes with this kind of gameplay 
wishing all the best for the full release

#####

didnt pay 250k for ocean exploration
and even have a sushi restaurant

1110 would recommend

#####

i got sucked into the initial gameplay loop which felt like a really robust old kongregate hidden gem with number go up upgrade progression revealing more and more systems that also want bigger numbers but the momentum dies as the core loop keeps getting interrupted for more and more and more unskippable cutscenes tutorials and interruptions i just sat down to play a quick fishing dive and the day started with two separate quest dialogues with new associated objectives including one that consisted of calling another character to actually receive an objective then a reminder popped up about a twoday timer ticking down that i didnt initiate and then i remembered tat the day before had set up an entirely new game mode separate from all that stuff with its own currencies and minigames with obsessively deep progression systems the intro to all of which was set in a zone i couldnt save my progress in i didnt go collect fish to sell at a sushi restaurant after all that i just turned off the game instead

i want to say this is fun in bursts and that hopefully i come back but right now i still feel like im waiting for the tutorials to stop so i can just enjoy my nostalgic game that feels like im on a flash site in the late 2000s and that is simultaneously surprising to experience at all in 2023 but also reaaaaaaally spoiled by unskippable unsaveable stretches that are becoming more and more of my time playing rather than that nice nostalgic upgrade grind i was sold on

#####

the first several hours are fun chill and full of exploration and adventure as you go on the hunt upgrade your gear and plunge to new depths  around the midgame it turns into a series of endless dialogue cut scenes fetch quests minigames stealth missions and even more of a micromanagement simulation

i wish i could give this a neutral review but it hit me that i was just no longer having fun  certainly this will appeal to a certain kind of gamer but it just wasnt me

#####

amazing game or should i say games

#####

this is a very pretty clever relaxing game ruined by a qte with feverish buttonmashing if you have arthritis nerve damage carpal tunnel syndrome etc then watch out it broke my heart finally i quit trying uninstalled the game and asked for a refund if the developers ever release an accessibility fix ill be happy to dive back in

#####

very cute and relaxing would recommend to anyone looking for a stardewlike chill game where you cant do much wrong

#####

great game perfect combination of a restaurant simulator and open explorer im a casual gamer and i dont normally spend hours in game but this one i originally thought it might get too repetitive but the environment changes each dive and as you progress other areas open up i get lost in the dive 

when is the full release

#####

hardest fish to kill is a damn spiky balloon fish

#####

who am i to disagree
perfect chill game
i lost my viriginty at the bottom of ocean

#####

game is fun but not made by an indie developer even though it keeps actively trying to claim that it is and even was in the indie category in the steam awards
this game was made by the people who made maplestory go to the wikipedia for mintrocket it takes you straight to nexon mobile for crying out loud a huge developer its fun i like it but screw you for trying to trick people youre a big time developer dont try and invade the indie market its not for you

indie means independent developer not whatever bs excuse you tried to make at the steam awards

#####

who would win in a oiled up twerk off 
dave the diver or scuba steve

#####

a crack pipe is easier to put down than this game

#####

a relaxing indie game that will keep you wanting for more  the storys charming the game play is immersive the music is amazing i love the ost but best of all the characters are quirky and memorable  

even without a sale this games worth every penny

#####

so addictive i cant stop i dont want to stop i havent seen my family in days i am fine with this

#####

wide as an ocean deep as a puddle

bthis is of course my personal views and feelings on this game so take my review into prespective with other both positive and negative review to get a better picture of what you might get from this gameb

throws more and more systems and tasks at you rather than making fewer things have more depth
the company that made this is a shell company of nexon and i can definitely feel that influence theres a lot of attempted charm and personality but it fall feels incredibly calculated the writing almost nonsensical the characters cooky and random the locations that at times dont even make sense within the game universes own logic
 theres also certain mobile game influences that dont make sense like operator codes to unlock appearances with 
theres just so much stuff thrown into this game that makes me feel like they had idea after idea and just implemented it until they had their next idea its unfocused and busy

hell i cant help but shake the feeling ai had something to do with this game this game that has been in development for some 4 years by a company that has only existed for about 1½
im naturally suspicious so maybe im being overly paranoid

now that the game has thrown yet another new system at me with tasks i have to complete i feel like i probably dont care to finish this game anymore it all feels like hollow padding of a homonculus of a game that doesnt quite know what it is
but hey its cheap so if you like the endorphinehunting collectathon you might fancy this more than me

#####

originally dave the bdriverb the main character enters a coma and proceeds to become dave the diver 

game is great and a lot of fun i rarely recommends something before finishing the actual game but theres so much content and everything is so much fun that i cannot help but to do so even if the base game only had around 20 of what it already does it would be a good purchase 

just do it buy the game


updating for the event

#####

wonderful little game right here that came out of nowhere for me

it has two parts to it

1 you have the diving elements where you have to get fish for the sushi bar you go diving for fish and other goodies

2 you then have the sushi bar part which is you making the menu based on what fish you got and help out when customers come

it is a wonderful mix and super chill also lastly the dialogue is great its a real wholesome game in general but especially with the dialogue

if you want a fun chill and relaxing game that is a nice mix of adventure diving and fishing in the water and also sushi bar management give it a try

no joke at all when i say this is in my top 10 games of 2022 which includes the likes of elden ring the game has a ton of charm fun gameplay nice art design and just wholesome all the way around already in great shape i cant wait to see what else gets added to the game down the road its a wonderful start here

it also runs very good on the steam deck and controls perfectly with the joysticks right away

#####

fantastic game very addictive gameplay loop great music great game to play to destress and relax and hilariously entertaining cutscenes my only complaint is that it is kinda short as ive been able to do most everything in it in about 1520 hours of play but its only 20 and its still in ea so im sure ill be getting a lot more time out of it anyway 

and theyre constantly adding improvements as well was going to put in feedback that we could use a sort option in the recipe menu and they did in todays update are they psychic

very addictive in all the right ways

update post release
still loving this game but with the full release weve got some new content that doesnt feel fully fleshed out yet stuff like

enemy movement can get kinda jank

bug where the game forgot my keyboard existed only once thankfully

some minigames are a little wonky mario one has weird spacing and the stealth level is meh

could use more breathing room between events

less button mashing could use an accessibility option for it and just turn it down anyway my keyboard is going to call the police on me

overall still loving the game would be a 1010 were it not for the above issues and its still like 910 with them excellent game that could use a couple updates

#####

this is a great game and i would have given it a positive review but one problem makes it unplayable for people like me if you have any sort of carpal tunnel or handwrist issues do not buy this game they force you to do button mashing quicktime events that require you to mash the button super fast there are no accessibility options to change this and i physically cannot place this game without hurting myself

#####

absolutely fantastic many things to like about this one rewarding exploration lots of variety art style is top notch especially the cutscenes great soundtrack

what i liked the most was diving ever deeper and runningswimming into increasingly bizarre environments and creatures

however imo after about 20 hours it does start to get a bit repetitive i finished the main story but probably wont go for the 100

#####

i love this game love it love it love it but the accessibility is awful the qtes with the harpoon absolutely destroy my hands and give me rsi is no time flat the lightning harpoon qte goes so quickly i cant even read what im supposed to do before they disappear the game would benefit from some more forgiving time windows and options that dont leave me in pain after playing

saw a friend wish listed it when it was in the earliest of its early access and got it and god damn this game got me reminiscing the days when i was a kid playing b feeding frenzy b  without the feeding and b diner dash b without the dashing 

the game filled me with nostalgia and not to mention the gorgeous pixel art style and stunning animations which i almost never skip the story itself is quite nice and captivating the game is meant for casuals who sometimes want little challenge but not a soulslike challenge so that it doesnt get boringthe addition of a running a sushi bar is absolutely adorable due to its simplicity 

the game play itself can be seen as repetitive for some because its meant for casuals but thats the charm of it if youre feeling a bit spicy and aggressive get the spoiler flame spoiler shotgun spoiler yes it burns spoiler if youre feeling cautious you can get the spoiler sniper spoiler there are multiple ways to play a dive run 

but the most enjoyable part for me is the feeling you get when you discover a new place or a new fish species that makes new sushi 


id give it a solid910

#####

just the kind of game you wanna play if you want a break from tense actionpacked games relaxing good story and even better characters clearly and neatly inspired from anime and a diverse set of loot and upgrade options oh and the relaxing bit doesnt mean it never gets stressful for example the boss fights are really intense and it does have roguelike features

definitely worth the money

#####

this game is just perfect barely even played 2 hours and i can already confidently call it a masterpiece and thats before its even fully released the gameplay loop is incredibly engaging it uniquely blends two genres that are usually seen independently  explorationresource gatheringcrafting and restaurant managementcustomisation this works flawlessly and gives the game great variation preventing it from growing stale as you are swapping between these two fronts with great pacing both sides of the game are enjoyable and feel rewarding with frequent feature unlocks that add additional layers to the game customisation options gear upgrades and collectibles namely a pokémonesque card system a perfect optional feature for completionists

the combat feels fair and can honestly be avoided in many cases making the game accessible for most players as it caters to casual playstyles as well as allowing for more intense intentional challenge

the pixel art is gorgeous 25d was the perfect choice of medium  the world is vivid and the art style feels unique you can tell how much love was poured into it just through the visuals there are detailed animated pixel art cutscenes to accompany certain restaurant upgrades and their inclusion showcases passion as in the game would feel no less whole if they were absent  their existence is just a cherry on top

dive catch fish cook fish story good game very good

#####

i heard a lot of acclaim and recommendations for this game but i personally didnt like it that much

for the most part dave the diver had little problemsolving challenge but lots of grind a lot of the gameplay was make numbers go up collect x of y object go to a farm multiple times a day to manually remove weeds and so on

the game also heavily featured quicktime event type interactions it showed me a prompt on screen to press a button and then i pressed that button again and again and thats as deep as it got for much of the gameplay this was especially true in the minigames which dan the diver had in overabundance so many shallow oneoff minigames which didnt require any decisionmaking and didnt ask me to develop any reusable skills it just said press this button and then i pressed it

i enjoyed the boss fights the most which were the rare place where the game didnt just tell me what to do but instead let me figure it out for myself i also enjoyed setting the menu at the sushi restaurant each night trying to balance food price with popularity and maximize sales for the day

i did finish the game though and i did have some fun it helped me to further refine what i seek and enjoy from gaming


#####

my wife told me to stop playing this game and do the household chores before she smash my pc 
that makes me really wonder about my marriage life and personal choices

#####

this game has no right to be as good as it is lol it is by far my favorite game right now im losing my mind waiting for the full release so i can rank up my cooksta lmao 1010

 full review with screenshots httpswwwgamingparrotcompostdavethediverreviewlowpressurediving 

i wish i could leave a neutral score but given the options im closer to recommending it than not 

dave the diver is a laid back game about diving into a semirandomized ocean trench in order to catch loads of exotic fish to supply a sushi restaurant or at least thats what it is at the beginning dave will still be a diver at the end of the game but along the way hell end up moonlighting as a waiter a farmer a gambler and many many other things there have been plenty of games over the years that start with a ridiculously ambitious concept and only implement half the systems youd expect but dave starts with a very simple concept and dumps an mmos worth of subsystems on top of it theres no denying that its unique but does it work

the early systems certainly do diving has a whiff of roguelite about it since the things youll encounter are slightly different with every round and youre forced to find most of your equipment in the water the first biome mostly has your standard tropical fish that youd expect from a glance at the game but youll find more interesting encounters as you go deeper although the diving gameplay is largely the same from start to finish boss fights and oneoff encounters shake things up occasionally it does feel pointlessly restrictive that some of the boss fights can only be done on a specific day especially since youre allowed as many retries as you want but none of them are hard enough for that to be a huge issue outside of some tedious puzzle sections about 80 of the way through the game the diving is consistently enjoyable 

the restaurant is similarly mostly solid theres almost no depth to it but its satisfying in the same way that old flashstyle time management games were you pick some fish to use as sushi ingredients for the night and then spend the rest of your time running back and forth between customers and the kitchen to deliver their food or server them drinks you can hire staff to be able to handle more guests or prepare sushi more quickly but in either case youre really just spending money to make the game play itself faster a very late side quest introduces a cooking mamastyle minigame that i wish had been used more and id also have liked to see decorations have any kind of discernible effect buying them feels very wasteful when they dont obviously do anything and the game constantly wants your money for more impactful items 

the systems introduced later in the game are a mixed bag at best most of them fit a pattern of being basically fine but not terribly fleshed out and collectively tedious youll have three different farms producing five different kinds of resources by the end of the game but each of them basically amounts to spending money and then waiting to get the outputs any seahorses you catch can be used for racing but thats just button mashing where youll win easily as long as your stats are decent many of these systems are also extremely grindy you can improve sushi recipes to boost their stats for example but doing this requires spending increasingly huge amounts of fish meat for each level similarly prices to upgrade your farms or equipment escalate quickly and have many levels so even with an efficient restaurant it can take quite a while before youre able to make relatively marginal improvements and dont even get me started on the stealth level

#####

i was on vacation and now this crazy chef is asking me to fight a shark for him because his pride is on the line i did not sign up for this man i just wanted to dive and everyone keeps calling me fat

#####

dave the diver is an amazing game

there is tons of stuff you can do and the story is super fun and goofy

here is what i enjoyed about the game

1 diving of course
2 collecting fish cooking ingredients cat food and a huge variety of items that help you improve your gear and stuff you need for quests
3 late at night you start to work at the sushi bar which is the territory of the legendary sushi chef bancho and your task is to help him select and prepare the dishes
4 you hire staff to work at the bar and sign them up for training while they obtain useful skills to make serving and cooking more effective
5 there are several interesting customers and vips who request special dishes all while events are hosted regulary to which you have to gather the right ingredients in time for them to be happy
6 decorating the bar is also a welcome option and sometimes you earn decorations through quests 
7 there is a lot to discover in the blue holelike really a lot coughseafolk cough and sharks god do i love sharks in this game
8 mini games dave owns a smartphone with all the useful information and mini games contacts and much more
9 farming is a thing in this game and it is perfectly done in my opinion
10 the most important thing dave is an absolute sweetheart who helps everyone outeven though he does have questionable people around him

there is so much more that i could mention but those are the things that stood out to me and i am still not finished with the game so i imagine there is a lot more on the way that i will enjoy

#####

im sorry but i have to agree with a lot of the negative comments that really appreciate the game  just as i do  but criticize the type of game it starts off and shifts to the comfy earlygame definitely wears off after some time

what starts out as a stardew valley with fishes quickly evolves to boss battles after boss battles with forced mini games that reward button mashing and tedious puzzles that are neither fun nor challenging
although for some reason some boss battles are ruthless since enemies are large have rapid dashes and damage you on touching you so getting bit by a shark is equally damaging as touching his back fin 

also a lot of quest interactions are forced and teleport you around without consent for example you could be planning on getting ingredients and finishing a quest in one run but a lot of times a quest ends in you just getting teleported back to your boat with no way of knowing beforehand 
this can easily be fixed by asking are you ready to leave in some way or form so you can finish looting or gatheting something in your vicinity 

the first few hours were definitely the best right now its just getting more stressful and tedious 
when i want to play a game to chill out this will not be on the list any longer 

while this review might seem negative i do agree with the positive feedback this game has gotten

#####

i like dave

#####

edit devs have responded that theyre working on it so fingers crossed that this will be a recommend soon looking forward to this game

each time you harpoon a fish you have to do a lame mash space as quickly as you can action not only is that boring loud enough to wake sleeping family members and unchallenging but its an accessibility issue i have a physical limitation that makes it difficult and painful to rapidly smash a key 

looking at the forum theres a 30 page thread stretching back the better part of a year of similar complaints it baffles that the devs havent added the option of a different mini game or at least a simple option to disable the buttonmash one the latter should be a very very simple thing to implement

id love to play this but that needs to change before i can fingers crossed but not very hopeful given the radio silence to date

#####

rating 710

dave the diver captivated me with its vibrant underwater world and intuitive gameplay mechanics exploring the depths discovering items and encountering exotic sea creatures provided a sense of wonder and excitement however the repetitive nature of the tasks and lack of significant variation made the experience feel stale rather quickly none of its core mechanics are deep enough to further dive into leaving me wishing for more complexity and depth to the gameplay despite this i found myself drawn to complete the game and unlock all the achievements driven by a desire to fully immerse myself in daves underwater journey while dave the diver didnt offer the depth and lasting appeal i had hoped for it still managed to provide enough enjoyment to warrant seeing it through to the end

#####

a great time

dives take place in a variable hole of limited breadth but plenty of depth with deeper regions containing pricier but also more dangerous  resilient sea life theres a real sense of adventure that comes with a limited oxygen capacity  fearsome aquatic life that can end your dive before its really begun while its not a hard game theres a real riskreward to be had throughout the game when it comes to dangerous species like sharks whose meat might be valuable but at much higher potential cost utilizing the gold you make from selling your sushi is the key to upgrading your gear to go deeper while also making sure you have enough to run the business during the story youll also unlock several items thatll make your trips more fun  open up new opportunities for you

the management side of things is enjoyable with enough layers to keep you invested with more being unlocked as you progress through the campaign theres hundreds of dishes  ingredients to be found  mastered so making the most of what you have access to is important add to that fish farm  farm management later in the game staffing concerns  more besides youll find theres plenty here to minmax if youre into that sort of thing

the cast is fun  expands nicely alongside minigames collectathon side content and a story thats charming despite being a little bit all over the place later on the game is packed to the brim with references  nods to other games that ill not spoil here but they definitely hit the mark more often than not

its not all good however the game has some puzzle segments which arent really puzzle segments as much as they are time wasters due to their ridiculous simplicity but that still doesnt stop dave telling you huh maybe i should pull that lever  well yes dave thanks for the tip the final few acts of the game in general feel a bit scatterbrained  rushed but they dont detract too much from the overall experience as you can fishcollectcook as much as you want in the postgame anyway

overall while far from perfect dave the divers addicting gameplay loop charming presentation  lovable cast make for an experience i wont be forgetting any time soon

#####

a better value then oceangate tickets

#####

i wanna be brief why i wouldnt recommend getting the game even though its great in many aspects
while the game looks and sounds fantastic the more i play the more i get the feeling that the developers just doesnt respect the time of the player every new mechanic which you will get in an endless rapidfire stream just tries to be take as long as you can barely tolerate
the best example for this a the frequent puzzle sections in the story sections the game tells you without fail how to solve all new puzzle mechanics and then you just have complete them which comes down to picking up rocks and slowy swim with them somewhere or pull something down a few meters in the later parts you are also in nearly no danger because your airmeter is most of the time between 70 and 90 percent full when you find the next container with new air
the only danger in the game are some really annoying enemies that do obnoxious amounts of damage and bosses
those are awesome for the most part i even liked the mantis shrimp even though the tip at the start of the battle will lead you away from the stuff you should really do but having a cool bossbattle every few hours that you cant even repeat and than another 14 hours boring busywork is just soul crushing
if mintrocket would have concentrated more on making mechanics more fun and less on cramming as much of them in this game im sure this would have been contender for game of the year for me
i will probably still finish the game and update the review if anything big changes but for me right now its a clear no for the recommendation not because the game is bad or to expensive but because it just wastes its potential by wasting your time

#####

im going to start off by giving dave the diver the praise it deserves 
this game is nothing if not charming there is so much character to almost every aspect of the world and it just radiates joy the visuals are a beautiful blend of pixel graphics and lowpoly 3d that on many occasions left me in awe the story is fun and lighthearted and it constantly encourages you to push on and explore more of the game world there is a pretty large variety of things to do and the game introduces new mechanics all the way up until the end which helps to keep things feel fresh to an extent 

which brings me to why i in good conscience just cant recommend dave the diver to anyone
its simply too long and paced in such a way that some aspects of the game start to feel like chores instead of relaxing fun in my opinion it overstays its welcome by something like 230 hours and while there is a lot of variety the core gameplay of actually fishingdiving isnt strong enough to carry the rest of the game on its shoulders it sells itself as a game where you dive during the day and manage a restaurant during the night but that balance is so heavily skewed towards diving that only 5 minutes out of every hour is spent actually managing the sushi shack and by the time you get to the deeper parts of the sea youre going to spend a lot of time retreading the same maps over and over and over again 

which brings me to the second part that was a letdown for me the broken promise made at the start of the game the blue hole is a changing place that mutates and shifts every time you dive into it sure but the blue hole is a very shallow part of the over 600 meter deep map adding to the frustration you will almost always want to fish in the deepest waters possible which means that youre going to spend a big chunk of your time pacing through the same oppressive dark corridors of the depths desperately trying to find rare spawning fishes so that you can progress your cooksta rating disappointingly enough once you manage to get past the depths and reach the two last levels of the sea youll quickly realize that they are the least interesting maps in the game both sporting a very limited variety of fishes and uninteresting geometry to navigate for what its worth theyre really pretty as i mentioned before

furthermore holy mackerel this whole game feels like an extended underwater level and i mean yeah sure its a game about diving but why does everything feel so sluggish there is a notable delay between clicking the right mouse button and pulling up your harpoon aim which makes it so that you often use a melee attack when you wanted to fire off a shot this doesnt sound like a big issue but since there is a big focus on fighting bosses that are very much faster than you and im counting every shark as a mini boss to that list you end up in scenarios where you have a fraction of a second to attack before you need to start dodging their attacks again you could lessen this problem by using firearms with better range but the game very clearly tells you that you shouldnt use them since you get fewer rewards from dead fish this leads you to rely on random drops from randomly spawning weapon chests to get just the right harpoon tip that has either a slowing effect so you can actually fight the sharks or a sleep effect once you unlock the yellow submarine upgrade roughly 1520 hours into the game and its arguably pretty underwhelming until you get the 2x and 3x upgrades for it theres another point i could make about how your oxygen tank is both your health bar and sprint meter but this review is long enough as it is and i dont want to rant forever and go on another tangent

this sluggishness extends to every other aspect of the play experience as well dave moves like a mollusk both on land and in the water which makes mundane things like talking to bancho at the end of the restaurant or emptying the fish farm needlessly time consuming tasks when you pour tea and other drinks at the restaurant there is a long pause between every action so you feel like youre wasting a lot time just waiting to regain control of your character so you can service the other patrons even just confirming a choice by holding a button takes a few beats longer than it has to i think even the devs are aware of this ive gone back to watch the trailer i can see that almost every single gameplay clip in it is sped up a bit not a great look to be honest

another small issue that made itself evident throughout the game is just how many quick time events there are on a conceptual level i take no issue with qtes but it feels a bit thematically dissonant to slowly paddle your way through almost all of the game only for it to be undercut by having to furiously mash the space bar as fast as possible for an extended amount of time 

and lastly the game holds your hand way too much there are fun little puzzles throughout the levels i think i would have really appreciated it if the game didnt go into a cut scene while explicitly telling me the solution to the problems before i even get a chance to explore whats going on its a small nitpick but its a cherry on top of an experience that at its core is pretty descent but undercuts itself by committing to a lot of annoying choices

out of the two fishing related games i bought as a part of this bundle i can with confidence say that dredge is the stronger experience it doesnt offer nearly as much in terms of gameplay but when i walk away from that game i was hungry for more whereas with dave the diver i felt exhausted and just happy that it was over

#####

good game i think dave is an inspiration to a whole generation and the sushi chef is my idol when i grow up i want to be just like him 1010 i recommend and i will dive again

#####

honestly better than i thought it was going to be gameplay loop is  dive into the sea to collect materials catch fish and do quests this happens in the morning and afternoon then you run the sushi shop at night by making the menu serving the food and decorating  loop the area you dive in is randomly generated and the story is interesting two thumbs up

#####

this game completely blown away with the changes in gameplay throughout the game minigames bosses etc everything was really well crafted must play this game before you die xd

#####

klaus the shark is a dark souls boss

#####

ridiculously wellmade for early access im thirteen hours into the experience and it still feels like i have so much left to dounlock its a great kind of addicting excited for the full release

#####

the game was so fun at the start when i was just catching fish and running the restaurant but the devs try to make this game so boring for some reason so many tasks that you have to complete are you just holding spacebar and carrying an object underwater from point a to point b no challenge no fun just tedium 

theres an underwater fish people village that you visit early on and while that sounds really cool it is one of the most boring parts of the game the villager quests are so boring and uninspired once again consisting of the same hold space here and move to here mechanics 

a good example of the devs realizing how slow this game is yet doing nothing about it also happens in that village in the underwater village you move so slowly and the village is massive simply crossing across it is a 2 minute excursion the devs must have realized that because they added a underwater taxi that you can ride only in that village except it triggers a cut scene each time you summon it it disappears whenever you go into any building and it uses that villages exclusive currency each time you summon it again thereby making even the fast travel slow and punishing

cant wait for the sequel to this game where you manage a paint drying business

#####

i dont usually write reviews but this game is by far the best single player video game experience ive had in a while so i had to come and leave some praise to the developers

the game is fun has a good story has a lot of different systems to keep you engaged its really well thought

congrats to the developers and i cant wait to continue my adventures when more content comes out

developers say 810 hours of content with the current version you can easily do 20h and still have some smaller stuff to do theres lots of side content waiting

#####

i have been playing it since prerelease and was more than excited for the fullgame
i am more than satisfied

for people who enjoy singleplayer games 
this game is a masterpiece
i am out of words to write a review because i cant describe how flawless it is
music  art  story   weapons  crafting system  upgrades  boss fights and the entire concept is well executed with the full release they implemented puzzles as well which are enjoyable


oh  and i am japanese so i might be biased  i love sushi 3

but truly this game is very fun for those of you who are into playing alone  it encompasses everything youd look for in a singleplayer game
my only sadness is that i know this game might end someday but it will be one of the masterpiece games i will always remember

#####

going deep sea diving to feed my cat 3

#####

tldr this game has a lot of charm i feel as though there are flaws to the diving experience that make it difficult to enjoy at times so i cant say that i recommend it at its current state


 the restaurant aspect is quite fun i wish it were more central to the gameplay the process of growing your business is addictive and i think this is where it shines the animations for special guests interactive food serving mechanics like serving various drinks the only issue i have is that i wish it could be longer granted im only two chapters in and i understand that this game is meant to focus on the diving part

unfortunately to say that the restaurant part outshines the diving part is telling of the latters flaws i have a growing list of issues in my diving experience that is making it difficult to enjoy

 scripted diving moments feel too disruptive i might go down to focus on catching all kinds of fish as well as finishing up a fetch quest for a customer only to end up fighting a boss i did not expect the rude interruptions of my expeditions where after certain quests are complete im forced to go back up to the boat and wait for the next day to fish again is not fun 

there was a countdown toward an event where i had to prepare a bunch of menu items of a specific kind jellyfish and when the day came a quest regarding the sea people forced me to miss the opening of the restaurant i thought i had missed the event as well and was upset fortunately it did push to the next day but this felt like a bug to me  

 there should be an ability to reference other info besides quests while diving i get that having a smartphone underwater is not realistic but i feel like its necessary to be able to access info on what fish you need to get for certain menu items for achievements or even like where i could find certain fish all of this is available on your phone and the restaurant but not while youre diving just something to think about

 diving controls feel really muddy to me this issue is glaring especially during combat events it just isnt fun to struggle because aiming is limited and you cant turn as quickly to avoid wide attacks i wish that moving around felt more responsive but its too slow and limiting at its current state i know that charms exist to boost certain stats but in my opinion the difference is negligible 

i am sure that time will either prove that the developers can create a more cohesive enjoyable experience or that this game is simply not for me i really want to like this game so my fingers are crossed

#####

before i get negative bthis is a good game that is enjoyable for a lot of people for good reasonb however to me this is a great example of a good game that gets kneecapped by its execution the core gameplay loop of gather fish and run the restaurant is fantastic and fun yet it feels like the creators had no confidence in this being enough leaving a lot of it feeling thinabandoned in favour of other aspects

as a result there are tons of eventsminigames most of which are obligatory explained in a window that only appears the first time you start that will stop the fun gameplay loop in its tracks constantly 

without spoiling you will be forced to skip days without warning locked into timed minigames that cannot be skipped or exited boss fights in the middle of the otherwise chill game experience and sudden walls of dialogue to either overexplain a plot point or awkwardly explain a new tackedon game feature

combined with the delay for entering and exiting all areasui elements and gotcha aspects designed to punish you for not remembering one of the many random tasks that are scattered across said areasui makes for a great game that actively tries to prevent you from playing the core game

#####

dave the diver blew me away and to be honest i wasnt expecting it its a hotchpotch of different genres all coming together to deliver a beautiful gaming experience all tied together by charming pixelated art its everything that i look for in a video game and more

#####

tell em to bring out the whole ocean
tell em to bring out the lobster 


#####

if moonlighter had a better story less glitches better scenery more game mechanics and revolved entirely around fish it would be this game

#####

excellent feel good game mixing brillantly different genres  exploration hunting management rpg minigames with a marvelous art direction 
it still has some small flaws  ergonomy could be better especially in the inventory or the farm management some phases are too short when you manage the restaurant rush of customers at night it last only a few minutes your gameplay is also often interrupted by special events or introduction of new character after 20 hours at the opposite it slow down and the interest decrease still the fun is there till the end
devs offered an interesting dlc for free and keep updating their game i hope for more dlc and one day a sequel

dave is fun dave is chill dave catch fish be like dave

#####

as of the time of this review ive played 18 hours in early access

play this game early access has tons of content plenty of story and loads of enjoyable things to discover every time i thought there couldnt be more there was more this game sincerely has every kind of minigame you can imagine and theyre all delightfully carefully lovingly crafted

the characters are hilarious a lot of them arent ilikeablei  but also they still are just because theyre wild caricatures especially our weapons dealer oh man hes both the worst and best character at the same time meanwhile no one is particularly nice to our sassy relatable dave but relationships develop and mature 

and lets not forget about the exquisitely rendered pixel art the level of detail thats gone into the aesthetic of this game is top tier its especially impressive when you run into the larger sea creatures like the whale which comes across as absolutely majestic i was constantly distracting myself by looking at the underwater landscapes the beautiful interesting fish the flashing neon lights of the sushi bar and the unfathomably wild charmingly rendered cut scenes when one of the npcs did an upgrade or some sort of action 

so this game is about catching fish but its also about exploration wonder interpersonal relationships ecological conservation and more i dont want to spoil all the things that you have in store for you but know that it will go past anything you can imagine

#####

dave the diver is a great combination of the cozy game genre perfect for relief in stressful periods of life while it seems like there isnt much to it when you just sratch the surface the game keeps on giving it has a story quirky and adorable characters a nice sense of humour challenge should you impose it on yourself and whenever i thought ive seen it all it reveals more and more content even past the end of the storyline as if its trying to do everything out there but all the genres mix naturally and usually you can skip an activity you dont particularly like entireyl

all this in a beatiful meticulously crafted pixel art and some of the best fullscreen cutscenes which there are a ton of and they almost always put a smile on my face

so far i think this is the ultimate cozy game
10 stars

#####

me and my partner spent 11 hours straight playing through as much as the early access had to offer in this game highly addicting very fun gameplay  honestly didnt expect this much out of a game about diving  spearfishing i love the graphics in this game so much its so gorgeous also the vibes too very chill and enjoyable

#####

this game is a gem
super chill great looking and full of good humor unexpectedly good storyline and extremally likeable characters just surprising amount of content really clever boss fights that are never just bullet sponges loads of minigames that diversify the gameplay a lot amazing animations huge variety of sealife and cooking options
cant recommend this game enough
i hope in the coming days this will be developed with as much love and care as up to this point

#####

one of the most polished and entertaining earlyaccess games ive ever played combines a satisfying pair of retro gameloops with cute pixel graphics and some genuine charm plus you get to play as a fat bloke with a beard  finally a game character i can really identify with 1010 would dive for sushi again

#####

1010 superr recommended

dave the diver is a fun game it is in early access and i am excited for upcoming content the pixel graphics are fantastic as well this game gets new content and updates

#####

idave the diveri is boring and mediocre  i have a hard time understanding why it has so many positive reviews  i might put another hour into it but i just dont understand the appeal

the game sets up a pretty simple gameplay premise relaxing roguelite fish catching by day relaxing restaurant management minigame by night  the concept reminded me of a bit of irecettear an item shops talei in which you alternate between managing an item shop and collecting items in a simple arpg minigame

the general gameplay is about on par with a mid 2000s nintendo ds game  while a little embarrassing in 2023 it wouldnt be a big deal if idave the diveri wasnt so hellbent on interrupting its own gameplay loop  every time i get in the water somebody is there to expound on some new and uninteresting gameplay mechanic or give me some new and asinine task which usually involves 1 swimming to some location and 2 playing an unfun minigame or fetch questing some garbage  when you complete that task and return to the surface someone is there waiting to give you some other boring task to do  its honestly the opposite of relaxing it reminds me of my actual job where ill be engaged with one task only to get called up on some uninteresting shortnotice project

the reality is that dave the diver is not a game where the player is a deepsea diver by day and a restauranteur by night it is a game where the player is a fulltime fetchquester who is occasionally permitted to play the restaurant minigame in between their fetch quests

however the pixel art and animation is outstanding  if only it wasnt wasted on such a boring game

#####

why have a game that centers around one gameplay loop when you can have one that focuses on three different ones it is an arduous task to make a compelling game on its own but to have different styles of gameplay be both polished and engaging is nothing short of a feat this is why developer mintrocket has to be commended for their work on dave the diver the latest indie sensation that has taken the internet by storm

this is the secret ingredient of dave the diver it is a simple game but never simplistic every day is split into two diving sessions in the sea in the morning and one night of managing the restaurant and serving customers the underwater exploration feels basic enough use a hook to capture fish or a knife to kill them as well as recover algae and other useful ingredients however after a while dave is given a rifle to defend himself from dangerous marine creatures and then he discovers more guns with different purposes and then he can upgrade them to add extra features to them and so on

there are a lot of worse games for the price but honestly this did not do it for me i found it to be pretty shallow a compilation of redundant minigames sewn together to push forward a story that was not particularly interesting the restaurant management portion of the game play loop is essentially a coolmathgames premise with better graphics the other side of the game loop is the fishing bit and all that is is a gun and a harpoon and both either do is point and click to kill fish and then you just pick them up to sell as sushi later the gunplay and fishing are not fun if anything they are annoying 

the characters are silly and unique but they arent worth following there is one point in the game where a character gets a fleshed out backstory and you figure this will keep up but it turns out to be a oneoff and not even relevant to the greater story it isnt even brought up by that character ever again
by the end of it the ending is super rushed and not particularly rewarding it is like a bundle of ideas and gameplay mechanics that were never actually fleshed out 

still the visuals music and general vibe of it is endearing i can understand peoples excitement for this because it has a lot of charm

#####

dave the diver is hard to judge because the game has two distinct halves the first half is wonderful serene and like other dig games compells you to traverse further with the promise of new fish and mysteries as you descend 

the second half is devoid of the joy from the first half and replaces it with fetch quests excruciatingly long dungeons with environmental puzzles invincible enemies and multipart boss fights  theres even a boat chase level and a tedious stealth section

in all had the first half been expanded to continue the fantastic loop of catching fish and restaurant management it would have been a complete and thoroughly enjoyable experience unfortunately the monotony and disparate gameplay of the second half draged the entire experience down

#####

absolute masterpiece the core loop is so satisfying that i plan to keep on playing after seeing the credits and i still cant understand how it keeps introducing mechanics and systems the whole game with an absurdly high frequency until the very end this game feels like a polished amalgam of several video game developers theses and i love it

#####

really got into this mixes pixel graphics  3d ocean exploration  fish and item collecting  crafting  then at the end of the day you manage a restaurant which includes a whole other layer  menu prep  decorating  staff hiring  then diner dashin through the actual meal time it hooked me good and i hit the early access story cap and i want more

#####

this game changed me i was in a tight spot in my life and almost went diving forever until i found this game buy it 100 buy it for me

#####

this is one of the best games ive played in a while while its still in early access and theres a limited story mode available ive still put in 17 hours and enjoyed every moment of it gameplay graphics animation and grinding are tight better than a lot of fully released games theres enough exploring fishing farming fish breeding and working in the sushi restaurant to make this worth your while

#####

less is more man dave the diver tries to be so many different games and it quickly became overwhelming and annoying it wants to be a diving game restaurant management game 2d rougelike 2d combat managing a social media account etc etc on top of this theres side quests crafting upgrades recipe research the fish pokidex etc it just never stops adding stuff for you to worry about the funniest part of all this is dave doesnt wanna do all this crap either every time somebody shows up to give him more chores hes never excited about it and rightfully so he carries this business on his back gets no credit and is continually insulted by everyone around him me and dave just wanna fish and serve sushi and at every opportunity i feel like im being taken advantage of i just want one day to practice and make some money is that too much to ask when 25 different game systems are thrown at me in the course of an hour

#####

starts off as a very fun game but at some point it randomly decides to become a visual novel replacing the enjoyable gameplay with an endless array of cutscenes followed by brief 2 minute segments of trivial puzzles and quicktime events the interesting exploration and cool boss fights of the first half simply disappear replaced by a linear series of corridors for you to trudge through every new room complete with a relatively simple puzzle that the game nonetheless pauses and explains to you it is is also joylessly stretched out by forcing you to return to town and get a mcguffin every few puzzles so you dont blow through it all in one go 

for some reason around this time you also start unlocking a lot of random minigames and activities to do if only they had maintained their focus on what drew players in the first place this could have been an excellent game instead i find myself struggling to finish it hoping to find its original charm somewhere hidden amongst what its become

#####

the first 1015 hours are surely a blast but then the core game loop youve enjoyed smoothly transitions into a painful grindfest thanks to the constantly added new featureslayers there are too many things to do so youll reach a point when you dont want to continue playing anymore

#####

dave the diver is an amazing game with a large variety of game play elements  it is a lot of fun and has clever and inventive ways to get around some of the repetitive nature of the primary game play  there are several different mini games some resource management business management and card collecting combined with a humorous and compelling narative makes it one of the best indie titles ive played  highly recommended

#####

game is incredibly unique and filled with content  the back and forth between the fishing roguelite element and restaurant management feels like two games in one with how in depth each system is  plus the tone of the game is pretty lighthearted so its something i can recommend to really anyone

#####

i got hooked on the game play right away engaging in the games depth is rewarding but not required to simply enjoy exploring or collecting

this game works perfectly on a steam deck small items are really small on a 7 screen but i wouldnt say its a problem 

i absolutely love this game and i hope they can add infinite content because theres nothing else like it there are so many things to do so many fun little details i would love to list all the things that i loved but i dont want to spoil anything dont look at the screenshots its probably too late if youre here just dive right in its worth it

my wife and kids dont really know what games im playing but they know about that one because ive been switching between my pc steam deck and simply talking about the game for most of the last 7 days its that good can you imagine when it gets out of ea

1010

disclaimer i did not get a free copy of this game by the developer i got it from another curator who resellstrades the games he gets you could say i paid for the game but the devs didnt get my money so i think its important that i leave a honest review to make up for that and i promise to buy any future dlc

#####

one of the most enjoyable experiences ive had in a while and its only early access i cant wait for the full release of this game it is absolutely worth every penny

#####

finally a protagonist with my body type

#####

lovely little game cant wait for the full release

#####

i have two reviews for this game

if you are a normal gamer you should absolutely get this game if your into a chill game with lots of different mechanics and a wacky story

if you are a disabled gamer you should stay far away from dave the diver it not only has no accessibility options it doesnt even have basic gamepad options this wouldnt be the biggest problem if the game stayed mechanically light but it doesnt you will frequently encounter sharks and bosses that require higher mechanical precision and there will be no options to adjust any of it i dont like writing this review because i hate being a whiney cripple and i have enjoyed many aspects of the game but i rarely encounter games this unwelcoming to disabled people

maybe theyll improve it in the future there have been regular updates but as of now do not buy

#####

dave the diver feels like a warm hug the pixel art is gorgeous the music is so calming and the mix of exploration and management is perfectly chill relaxation game

#####

steam ladder worldwide no1

#####

the first five hours of this game were great everything past that was slow repetitive and monotonous 

 the menu controls vary wildly from menu to menu i dont think this game was designed with km in mind
 the forced card matching minigame is infuriating
 there are oneshot kills by sharks that suck you in
 the game forces you to carry quest objects that take up room in your backpack and make you swim slower
 the more you are able to survive the longer each day takes causing the story in chapter 2 to take a very long time

i stopped playing when the fish people king told me i had to complete ten quests to make the people trust me and i was asked to swim around the village and ask everyone what they wanted me to do only to receive ten fetch quests they were all for various macguffins that could have been for tom hanks volleyball for all it mattered one of them actually was for a kids volleyball


#####

this is a pretty unique game i think the best way to describe it would be a stardew valley meets recettear meets a restaurant manager game mishmash then add about a hundred tiny minigames to it and some crazy characters and you pretty much get yourself a dave the diver

h1 gameplay h1

the main activity of the game is diving in the blue hole where all kinds of fishes can be found you hop in the water hunt for fish for the sushi restaurant gather ingredients and weapon parts avoid aggressive fish and try to manage your not so limited air supply while doing all that its fun its super relaxing and straightup addictive 

the first 20h of the game i literally couldnt stop playing collecting fish cards fighting pirates and bosses upgrading weapons and discovering the secrets of the lost civilization i wanted to do it all and as you progress more things to do open up breeding fish managing a farm and so on havent had this much fun in a game for a while

the game loses some steam later on however afaik the chapters were being releases during the early access and the devs had to keep the players busy between chapter drops later on the game gets a bit too grindy and theres a lot of things to manage diving sushi restaurant 2 farms fish breeding night diving gyao and other things require a lot of micromanagement and when you finally open a second location its just too much work i just wanted to dive man

one more thing that bugged the hell out of me is the inconsistency with the handholding sometimes the game would give you an unskippable popup and small minigame to try out new mechanics other times you didnt even know that theres something new to do hell i didnt even figure out you can refill the wasabi yourself until 15h into the game

h1 graphics and sound h1

i think the pixel graphics of dtd is great the characters fish and surroundings look absolutely beautiful especially the first and main zone of the blue hole is an absolute masterpiece for me the lively colours and lofi music feel amazing and even after unlocking all of the content the game has to offer i think i spent most of the time in the first zone its just so good

i felt a bit underwhelmed with the final couple of areas i think they were visually rather dead compared to the initial zone it doesnt help theyre mostly nonrandomized so there isnt much exploration to be done the shallow and medium depths change quite often which is very refreshing the rest of the game is rather static in comparison

h1 story and characters h1

the wacky characters of dtd definitely add a lot of charm to the game from the stoic bancho to animeobssessed duff they all find original and funny in their own way theres a lot of interactions between dave and the other characters and theyre often quite hilarious

the main story however feels pretty bland at first its quite interesting but as you go further it reveals itself as a rather cookie cutter experience no spoilers but halfway through youll probably already figure out how the game is going to end

h1 overall h1

i think dave the diver starts very strong i was in complete awe of it the first half of the game the latter half is not as good but i still think the game is amazing and definitely worth picking up even at full price

#####

game seemed fun for the time i played it unfortunately i was unaware of their affiliation with nexon a company i cannot in good faith support i wish they were more transparent about that information in the store page

#####

again missing a more neutral option for reviewing a game because even if i enjoyed some of the things that dave the diver has to offer there are some design choices on it that have worn me out and finally make me abandon the game

something very important to warn people thinking about getting the game this is not a chill management sim if i have to describe dave the diver i would say that is basically a very linear visual novel that presents you a lot of mechanics one after the other very abruptly with a sometimes fun sometimes awful story

i insist on the not chill part because this is my main complaint about the game it is constantly pushing you to do all the things the game wants you to do without letting you rest or taking these requests at your own pace sometimes these request pile up and all of them are mandatory if you fail to do a quest it is game over and you need to restart it there is no choice on dave the diver it is just one thing after the other

and yes the game tries to have a lot of different things to do you fish you attend the baryou upgrade weapons and your diver outfit there is the sea people the fish farm the rice and vegetable farma lot of things are added constantly so the game does not feel boring but in the end all of those things are just chores get 5 items to x person catch this one fish find this one person 

another point of friction for me is that while playing you feel like the devs thinks that the player is dumb every little new thing is explainedreexplained and then highlighted when you need to do this if you pair this with the fact that you spent all your time in the game doing one chore after the other the overall experience except for few moments is that of a gigantic chore in which there is no space for the player

i tried to like it as it is but i really thing that this game would benefit of a more slow pace and a bigger focus on the fishshop loop which is the best part of it but the constant interruptions so they can advance the plot and present you the 100th mechanic that wont matter after its presentation makes it somewhat tedious and frustrating



#####

game of the year 3

#####

its like subnautica in 2d but more forgivinning

clearly one of the best indie title of this year


#####

its the bancho cut scenes for me

#####

i love it it was great to enjoy it during my summer

#####

really fun and unique game theres so much love put into it
it does get a bit repetitive in my opinion since its pretty long took me around 20 hours but its worth playing it constantly throws new mechanics and stuff at you without overwhelming the player

#####

i dream of this game

#####

h1a passion project executed poorlyh1

the game starts with an intriguing concept hunt your fish and sell them in your sushi restaurant which you will also manage thats a fun and innovative idea right in a similar way to the game ravenous devils let me begin by saying that they have executed the pixel art style perfectly in this game this games visuals are amazing a cool aspect of the restaurant is the ambiance which varies according to your needs the amazing animations of the vips cooking animations hiring new people and training them to satisfy the restaurants needs and putting together the menu to suit each guests tastes i wish this side was the main part of the game because in dave the diver the games main focus is the diving part at 70 percent i must say that managing the restaurant 30 is way more fun the diving part begins cool as you find yourself in a colorful ocean surrounded by hundreds of different kinds of fish to find and explore you are accompanied by friendly dolphins and giant sharks to hunt while listening to enchanting aquatic atmospheric music this gets extremely tedious because its the same music for 40 hours you hunt for your fish then sell them at your restaurant throughout the night its a cool gameplay loop isnt it at the 10hour mark around when you discover the sea human civilization the games charm breaks down this is because thats when dave the diver becomes extremely repetitive and grindy

the game throws quests at you the game introduces you to many characters but none are truly interesting none of them feel like genuine friends to you every character you meet gives you fetch quests and you do them and get rewarded with money not that satisfying the missions and how they are presented to the player are poorly designed

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3001565931

i also didnt enjoy the micromanagement farms inside this game because you cant manage anything they are brainless work they have been placed in the game to artificially lengthen the game time minigames are cool though frequent qtes are tiring the diving part of the gameplay is very bland and does not feel right the controls of dave are not tight making boss and miniboss battles a tankversustank battle if you have enough hp oxygen you can tank the enemy spam your harpoon and easily kill the big buddy there is literally no strategic element to the hunting section of the game enemy hitboxes and animations also are not synchronized which makes combat frustrating at times even though its such a simple game at its core there were some cool bosses but they really didnt flow with daves controls most of the time forced stealth missions feel very out of place in dave the diver because stealth is not fun or engaging in this game

the main story is decent it evolves into a mystery story that i wont spoil it can be interesting at times there are tons of boring and unskippable dialogue and cutscenes thus the game makes you feel not in control so often they should have given us full freedom and control like in outer wilds for example

so dave the diver is this years trending indie game a better selection than that cat game for sure however a curious thing i have noticed is that almost every positive review has logged 510 hours of gameplay max this is a characteristic of casual players these days people enjoy a game for a few hours then bam positive reviews what about how that game will present itself to you in the last 90 percent will it be worth your time can the game keep the experience fresh for the players they dont care about that stuff but i am proud to say i do i have never reviewed a game without finishing it and i dont intend to start now ive played this game for 50 hours now completed its main story and have seen almost everything it has to offer i honestly cant see where all the excitement comes from to conclude is dave the diver an awful game no is it a masterpiece absolutely not

ok ill dive just one more time before bed

i honestly didnt think id be enjoying this game this much this game is so creative and storyrich be careful tho because once you start playing it you can hardly stop

#####

dave the diver is one of the best games that ive played this year it manages to combine the silliness that ive only seen in the yakuza series with the coziness of stardew valley the game is the equivalent of the saying but wait theres more because just when you thought you saw everything that it has to offer it hits you with a new minigame twist that you never saw coming

the gameplay is simple yet addictive making it perfect for a round of casual gaming the controls allow you to navigate dave through various obstacles and easily collect valuable items along the way below are some questions that will help you decide if this is the game for you

do you want to dive underwater fish and hunt for rare items and weapons   you can do that

do you want to run your very own sushi restaurant with menu specials and chef battles  you can do that

do you want to improve your restaurant by using an app that suspiciously looks like instagram  you can and need to do that

do you want to have a farm within arms reach that allows you to produce fresh ingredients for your restaurant  you can do that

do you want to have your very own fish tank that you can outsource straight to your restaurant at any time  you can do that

do you want to play a plethora of minigames featuring such classics as seahorse racing  i dont know why but yes you can do that

in conclusion dave the diver delivers a delightful underwater adventure with its engaging story beautiful visuals great characters and satisfying progression system its a game thats easy to pick up and play but hard to put down i have been a victim of the cursed promise one more dive before i go to bed numerous times

#####

dave the diver game of the year 2023  absolutely addicting  dont think just buy it and play it

#####

the core gameplay aesthetics and storytelling are all super well done but i  completely lost interest in this game when i reached the first big unlockable area and the game turned into fetch quest after fetch quest which was all required for the main storyline the beginning didnt feel grindy at all but once those quests started i couldnt keep playing

#####

dave the diver özellikle bu sene oynadığım oyunlar içerisinde kendine hem yer edinen hem de bendeki yarattığı etki inanılmaz mükemmeldi diyebilirim

balıkçılık dinamiğini denizin ihtişamlı sularındaki balık cinslerini avlayarak oyunda geçirdiğimiz günlerden restaurantımız yönettiğimiz sisteme kadar konuyu alan harika bir oyun olduğunu belirtmeliyim

oyunda her geçen saat acaba sıkar mı düşüncesiyle oynadıktan sonra oyunun sonuna doğru yaklaştıkça aslında ne kadar eğlendiğimi ve içerisinde barındırdığı özelliklerle yok artık bu da mı var diyebildiğim birçok içeriğe ev sahipliği yapmış olduğunu gördüm

 deniz içerisindeki balık çeşitliliği derinlere doğru indikçe farklı türleri ile karşılaşmak ve farklı tarzda balık bosslarını görmek güzel bir olay
 dalgıç kıyafetlerinin gelişimleri materyal çeşitliliği ve derinlere doğru indikçe farklılıklarını görebiliyorsunuz
 silahların verimli kullanımı ve geliştirme kısımları oldukça mantıklı işlenmiş diyebilirim
 oyunun içerisinde tanıdığımız her karakterin belirli bir hikayeye etkisi oyun içerisindeki tepkileri ve bize verdikleri görevler oldukça makul seviyelerde olacağını göreceksiniz
 çiftçilik kısımları ve balık çiftlikleri oyunun ilerleyen ritminde inanılmaz faydası olacağını göreceksiniz
 denizin derinliklerine doğru indikçe karşılacağınız mağaralar deniz insanlarının hikayesi farklı bosslar oyun için gerekli olan birçok faydalı şeyleri sağladıklarını göreceksiniz
 restaurant kısmına gelecek olursak inanılmaz etkilendiğim noktalardan bir tanesinin burası olduğunu söylemeliyim çıkardığınız balık türlerinden ya da çitflikten aldığınız sebzelerle inanılmaz bir yemek çeşitliliğinin olduğunu görmenizle birlikte gelen etkinlikle vip farklı balık türleri ile yapılacak yemeklerin etkinlikleri ya da masterchef vari durumlarla küçük yemek yarışmalarının olduğunu görmeniz inanılmaz bir mutfak deneyimi sunuyor ayrıca restaurantınıza mutfak servis ve bir şeyleri tedarik etmek için elemanlarınızı hem geliştirebiliyor hem de restaurant kısmındaki dinamiklerini gördüğünüzde sizi büyük yüklerden kurtardığını gözlemleyebiliyorsunuz
 onun dışında küçük mini oyunlar bulmacalar fotoğraf çekimleri ve daha fazlasını da oyunda görebileceksiniz

oyun gerçekten parasını sonuna kadar haketmesinin yanında ingilizce olarak belirli noktalarda zorlanabilirsiniz onun dışında gerçekten uzun süre önce radarıma giren ama çok fazla oyun oynadığım için fırsat bulamadığım bir oyun olmuştu fırsat bulduktan sonra oyun birçok içeriğiyle yağ gibi gittiğini söylemeliyim fiyatı düştüğünde ya da bütçenize uygun olduğunu düşündüğünüzde kesinlikle kaçırmayınız  oyunla ilgili aklınızda soru işaretleri olduğunda da sormaktan çekinmeyiniz

what a game it looks like an indie but so much in it its like stardew valley but with a bunch of nongenderspecific minigames and boss fights it was a true gaming experience than nonother everybody must play it

one negative it needs the gyao game to start more early it is boring at the end of the game to skip days to wait until they grow up and die

#####

its an interesting game  i want to like it quite a lot  its got a great atmosphere beautiful graphics and the core gameplay loop has a phenomenal amount of work put into it and is honestly very fun  every character design somehow even duff oozes charm and care and the sound effects and music are engaging and havent grown old even a bit

but it has a lot of small mechanical issues that add up and in a few cases enough questionable design choices all small ones admittedly that have made the last few hours of trying to enjoy it a chore and i cant say id want to play it further at this point

first off the game continually throws more and more at you but the pacing is inconsistent and oftentimes it throws enough at you at once that its difficult to manage

second the gunharpoonaiming system is an honest pain to use  there is an inexplicable limit to your aiming angle and despite being underwater dave is apparently incapable of pointing his guns up or down  furthermore you have to press down the right mouse button and then aim then left click to fire  on its own this isnt bad except that anything including firing the gunharpoon ejects you from the aiming state  and due to the animation timings this means that you are effectively stunlocked out of being able to use your gun for one or two seconds plus however long it takes you to leave and reenter the aiming state  if you forget to leave and reenter aiming instead dave will whiff his melee weapon like a fool

third there are inexplicable difficulty bumps in random places  shortly after the tuna event another special event started this time without fanfare just a notification icon in the corner and as part of it it seemed like much stronger enemies began spawning in areas that until that point had been completely lowlevel and easy to navigate  including one variant of shark that could kill dave with a 280oddbar oxygen tank in 45 hits and which moved multiple times as fast as dave meaning it was impossible to avoid and tanked far more damage than my upgraded gun could deliver  combat in general is plodding and a pain you have limited manoeuvrability and oftentimes you will get stunlockedmauled by one or more animals at once sometimes by surprise with literally no option other than to try and close the game before it autosaves

to further make combat a pain the ability to nonlethally manage fish is severely limited  the hush gun is laughably impotent against anything remotely threatening and the game itself is so amazingly stingy with net traps that it is a lottery gamble to see if you ever even manage to have the tools you need to complete some objectives effectively  this of course assuming random bad luck doesnt simply negate your run cost you any decent equipment you tried to buy to work with and cost you time that you cant get back  the game seriously needs a way to upgrade your defensivedamagereduction factor charms have not been sufficient thus far or to calm down combat for people who want to enjoy the more enjoyable parts of the game

there is also some inconsistency with the harpoon qtes with timing limits and ease and in general it feels like the games accessibility is limited especially with the razorthin reaction times you actually have to work daves hitboxes out of the way of incoming attacks given how slow he is even at maximum speed

its probably a game still worth supporting and its a huge amount of promise but there are definitely gotchas and the game has gone from fun to frustrating enough that for the time being i cant recommend it

#####

me and dave are making awesome adventures together 
from fighting meanies to saving cuties and getting nice gigglis from our one and only  master chef yummy
this game is a whole package to be explored 

love the game and love my fishis 3

#####

the game is a lot of fun the mechanics feel good if youre diving in the sea or serving drinks at the restaurant  if youre not doing the main missions diving can get a bit repetitive but the game is also called dave the diver so its kind of what you sign up for

#####

this games publisher is mislabelled this is released by nexon who are just plain evil you should avoid anything with their name attached to it which is why they do everything they can to hide it

#####

one of the best pixel games i have ever played the game constantly adds new stuff to do as you progress through to keep you entertained and involved recommended

#####

i  love  this  game  i dont always have a lot of time to game but this scratches farming time management restaurant exploration itches  its not easy but not too hard which is wonderful because i can play it in short bursts of time without having to resort to cheating  its not too grindy  its relaxing with it beautiful seas and fishes until i get eaten by a shark oops   i love that its a game inspired by a real person and a real story because were all stories in the end  its nerdy and clever and funny without being preachy or condescending a refreshing breeze considering all the games that feel the need to preachpropagandisescold you for some imagined wrong  ive even learned stuff through the random info and happenings
i dont eat sushi and i think this game is fantastic  im very excited to see future developments
tldr this game is just pure fun

#####

on a gameplay note

so generally i dont like writing reviews its a hassle 

but i want to love this game i really do the core gameplay loop of this game is so damn good and the game seems to either hate that it has a good gameplay loop or not be confident in it
 
sometimes it wants to be an action game its not good at that sometimes it wants to be a puzzle game its not good at that sometimes it wants to be a visual novel if its not focusing on dave or bancho its not good at that either sometimes it wants to be a farming game its not good at that so why is it the one thing the game is good at it seems to not want you to do the loop of fishing and running the sushi place generally feels good enough that i wanna ignore everything else but instead im stuck in chapter 4s boring plot

have fun every other day getting dragged along into some boring side quest for a 1 note character that ends in you swimming some place youve passed and never interacted with before 20 times before and then having to end the game to be spoon fed an item to solve this puzzle and then sometimes being forced into some garbage mini game and catching mostly shark and tuna cause nothing else is worth any money why put so many fish if theyre all worth nothing

the atmosphere is amazing dave and bancho are fun for the most part music rocks lighting is great art is awesome gameplay is great they recently added an accessability option for people who find button spamming harder 
i wanna love this game i want to i keep coming back and playing it cause theres parts i love

i think if the creators added a mode where once you beat the main story you can start over without any of the sea people plot or any of the puzzles or bosses or anything just a leisurely endless mode that you can progress through more roguelike esque that allowed you to focus on just the core gameplay loop plus weapons and farming i guess id enjoy it a lot more 


on a personal note

the game gets really weird about fat people sometimes

#####

i really wanted to recommend this game so i started writing a positive review however i did realize half way through that the mixed feelings that came up with the process were probably a sign that review should be negative so it is

the game is quite enjoyable at first game mechanics are good with a nice mix of relaxing atmosphere coupled with a little challenge here and there the night and day pace of the game is nice too and the main story isnt bad either pixel graphics are well done as well i was led to expect some resemblance with dredge and the first hour or two made me think it might just be true

however the longer i played the sooner i realized dtd is less a game than a collection of minigames strapped together once the sea people village is discovered theres barely any challenge anymore and the game mechanics go from ok to tedious quite fast i played a rough 30ish hour and im at a point where i just want to hurry and finish the main story to get a sense of closure before never picking up that game again i truly hate that feeling so chances are i wont actually finish it i believe im just not made for that grocerylist kinda game but maybe some people are afterall ubisoft has built a whole empire on similar mechanics and people keep buying their games so im sure the tediousness of it all appeals to some

tldr nice game at first becomes very tedious when you realize this really aint nothing more than three minigames in a trenchcoat

#####

you are a fool if you dont get this game

#####

amazingjust amazing so much love and hard work went into this title you can just tell that in the first 10 minutes of game play it is indie teams like this who show how games should be developed and when they should be released aaa titles need to learn from teams like this buy this game support teams that produce quality entertainment  1010 game play and audio and graphics great job well done

#####

i wish all games were this much fun the perfect balance between challanging and relaxing 95 out of 10

i couldnt sleep and was going through my email and noticed this had just released i really enjoyed the demo so i picked this up and thought id play for 2030 mins and then go back to bed 5 hours later and i only stopped playing bc i have to go run some errands otherwise id still be paying this gem of a rpgcooking sim mashup i like how so far even after 5 hours of playtime im still unlocking new things and upgrading just about everything else and even when it gets difficult due mostly from being swarmed by op fish and losing all your o2 i still want to play because it almost never feels cheap or overwhelming if you like action rpgs the mangaanime food wars or have been looking for a game to really sink some time into this is it right here 
glhf

#####

finished the game and glad i completed the achievements good grind

#####

i wish there was a meh option but ive played too many far worse games to not give this a thumbs up

this is less one game and more a collection of fishingthemed minigames most of which are references to other games i wish they had spent less time on the minigames and more time polishing the core fishing loop because i found it frustrating far more than i found it fun

#####

stumbled up on this hidden gem even though it was released last year its got 3 of my favourite things going 1 fishing 2 underwater 3 cooking  so good the artwork is amazing and the music is so on point in this game its got a story which so far keeps you interested but you can take it at your pace some of the cut scenes are hilarious so gives you a few laughs too for an ea game its very polished i havent had any crashes or bugs so far fully recommended

#####

at no point in this game did i know what was going to happen next by the end i was almost disappointed you didnt break through the earths crust to fight an old god great characters a fantastic mix of subtle and overthetop ridiculous humor all wrapping an entertaining experience

#####

the gameplay is great the animation shows such love and care that i cant not believe that these devs were truly passionate about their product play this

#####

i love this game so much

oh my fucking goooood

the graphics music and overall sound design contribute to a nice and chill atmosphere depending on the weather and your short term goals you will follow different strategies there are like 20 minigames grinding the gameplay loop is fun  i wish i could forget the whole story to start over

some mechanics appear a bit too late to my taste the weapon upgrades may be too expensive for the player to actually use them during the main quest some qte mechanics could be perfected  i played on a french keyboard meaning the layout is not qwerty still the game tells you to push keys that are not the one that are binded their engine can do many things and sometimes it feels some mechanics have been barely skimed over while being too good to be exploited for such a short time

i would love way more content and another main quest because that was a really enjoyable and memorable dive

#####

great visuals and sweet and short storyhopefully more to come this game is great for a calm and relaxing diving session highly recommend this game for any friend to have a nice relaxed time

#####

the kind of game that keeps me playing games every so often a game comes along that seems to get everything right dave the diver is a game like this i had no idea i wanted a diving  restaurant management sim so much until playing this simply amazing ill update more as i get further in the game

#####

tldr this is one of those games where it starts off very promising and it just gets worse the further you get almost like the demo was to bait people in then cram all the crappy stuff outside it this game does not value your time or rsi

after putting 30 hours into the game i cant recommend this game for someone looking for a complete package experience for a game that has a lot of problems the further you progress the story it is full of a lot of frustrations that just arent worth the hassle

on the surface this game is quite enjoyable and fun it boasts a lot of progression systems that are rather well designed from running a restaurant gathering resources operating farms gear upgrades it looked and played very well

so why the negative review because the negative parts of this game just leave a horrible experience of waiting to get back to the good stuff and most of them are mandatory to get through or just mundane crap for no reason it feels like the developers had too many ideas and tried to add them all instead of refining the good ones

so some of the negatives that turn this game from quite good to a pretty bad experience

quick time events there are so many qtes in this game it should come with a health safety rating for your hands it puts path of exiles flask piano mashing to shame seriously if you have rsi or value the health of your handwristsfingers i would advise to not play this game until they add accessibility options its that bad

suggestion to the above problem either add accessibility options or allow upgradingcharms to eventually remove some of the tediousness that is the qtes

bosses most people probably think boss fights would be a fun and cool experience and in any other game youd be right however in dave the diver the vast majority90 of them just suck from taking damage during times where you have zero control of your charactercutscene scene transitions to unintuitive mechanics and hitboxes most of these are mandatory and force you to complete them to get back to the good part there are a few bosses that are actually good

health and oxygen being the same resource this is like making stamina and health the same resource in dark souls just a poorly executed idea big enemies and bosses can sit on you and the only way to get away is to boost which consumes oxygenwhich is your hp which makes you die faster but all the large enemies have a dash that can very easily get them back ontop you of

hitboxes i cant count the amount of times i have gotten hit by an animation that has yet to touch my character because the larger enemies have weird tails and animations that cause them to be bigger then they seem 

game over mechanic when you diemostly due to out of your control crap listed above you get a game over that sends you back to the boat and you get to keep one item sometimes you spend 1520 minutes underwater collecting and exploring only to die to something you had very little control over you just wasted 20 minutes only to gain a single item the solution is to alt f4 and save scum so you get that section of the day back

suggestion to the above problem a charm or an upgrade path could allow you to take more items upon a game over

edit#1  removed feedbacknegativity on the stealth mission as checkpoints were added making it less frustrating

edit#2 finished the game after 40 hours still a lot of charm to the game still a few things listed above which are still a bit frustrating

#####

scrumptiously selfaware scuba fishing game paired with a sleek restaurant manager  the pace of satisfying goals and personal bests for each dive makes the flow even more addictive than it needs to be  tons of laughs thrills calculations risks ridiculous cutscenes resources great music fun weapons and dozens and dozens of fish to eat raw by the hand of a solemn monklike sushi god who i just want to see smile once  fantastic game for lovers of classic 8bit adventures innovative combinations of pixel and 3d art or anyone with taste

#####

while the first 8 hours of the game feels like a refreshing and relaxing take on the rougelike genre it gradually became a snoozefest chore simulator in the mid  late game it is anxiety inducing especially when you have to keep up with events that  usually overlaps with eachother

#####

h1this game is fantastic h1
game play wise it plays out like 5050 split between restaurant simresource gathering it makes sense since your operating a sushi restaurant and a diver

list
the music is great
the cutscenes being in 8bit pixel is cool addition
the story is interesting
the dialogue is very amusing
the minigames are okayish
the game play with the dive and explore element is quite nice the survival element of the diving portion is tied in with the oxygen meter if you have too much of a load youll get slowed down if you lose all the oxygen down there you end up at the boat and only lose your fish that session except for 1 thingfish you can bring with you
the restaurant portion is nice as well with there is no cliche dept looming over it like some other games like its gonna gets repossessed by the bank you help out at the resturant with serving and help set the menu for the guests to eat
list

uthe story is locked at a certain point planned for the rest to be in full release

despite this the game is still great and worth the priceu

#####

this is a really big game it is actually astonishing how many random features and assets theyve thrown in to this game many of which you are likely to only see once and never again an absolute ton of labor must have went into this

#####

like stardew valley but with more mini games action packed boss fights and no romances love it

#####

when i bought this game i was expecting an actual casual adventuremanagement game
emphasis on casual
it was advertised as such and hyped up by so many reviews as such
i did not really watch any lets plays my bad after starting to play the game watchingthe lets plays did not help much many were older or heavily edited

its not a bad game if you love button smashing and really clunky controls

the controls both kbm and controller are awful imho

the game is full of qtes tons of them
there is a qte override option in the settings but it isnt wellimplemented 
it is marginally helpful when diving and harpooning fish
in the sushi restaurant there is nothing to help with getting dishes serving tea and trying to run back and forth while dave gets exhausted every 3 seconds unlocking the ability to hire staff and train them takes forever you need to get gold status on cooksta but you cant get followers and upvotes on the phone app if you are overwhelmed with customers that you cant get to fast enough to serve the amount of time you have to get to them before they get mad is way too short the controls above ground are awful and only slightly better underwater the first few days are easy then you get slammed
the economy is bad too everything is expensive but you make only pennies after selling food and drink in the sushi shop or selling off excess ingredients fish after deducting the daily cost of operation you get punished hard f you skip the sushi shop because your hands just cant deal with the button smashing and really awkward controls even key rebinding did not help if you could use the arrow keys and the movement and action keys at the same time while in the sushi shop it would be much better but you cant you wont be using your mouse in the sushi shop making it so you could move with the mouse and pickup food and serve it would also be better

and omg the number of unskippable cutscenes so many unskippable cutscenes
so so so many unskippable cutscenes that dont give you any useful information they just show off the pixel art and add flavor flavor that isnt needed over and over and over and over  once is enough thanks i dont want or need to see the same cutscene dozens of times

buaccessibiltyub

not great

the settings menu only gives you the option of the click and hold qte overrride and a dedicated mouse cursor which is a giant hand instead of a tiny windows arrow cursor

the pixel art is beautiful if you are into it but for folks with certain forms of colorblindness its going to be bad

if your hands are older arthritic or you have tendinitis the game is very difficult to play and is likely to be painful
you can play short sessions but there are quests and locations you cannot save  exit from meaning you either finish it or lose the progress and have to do it over again

the text size is tiny even on a 2560 x 1440 34 monitor the font used is difficult to read it took me a long time to figure out that the thing that looked like an upsidedown battery was actually the letter q
bthere is no text or ui scaling option noneb

a good bit of stuff underwater is greyed out or very similar in color and saturation to the background it is on between that and the obnoxiously small text and hud that throws a big black window up on the screen often blocking what you are trying to fight or shoot with your gun or harpoon gun this game is going to be bad for folks with low vision or some other vision conditions really nearsighted you might be okay farsighted you are screwed

probably okay for some deaf and hoh players the music is okay but i didnt miss it when i turned it off but some audio cues will be missing making the game a bot more difficult since you wont hear hits with the gun or sounds of approaching danger or damage to dave

the controls are the worst part though the controls are awful for slow reflexes or tired hands

the game also throws you into situations with little or no explanation of what you have to do or expect and the tiny text in the hud and ui and how little time the game gives you to try to read it means yeah you are going to  miss a lot and have to retry a lot of things 

probably not a terrible game for some folks mostly younger with perfect vision perfect reflexes able to jitter can read tiny tiny tiny text dont mid replaying various quests dont mind getting punished like a thieving gollum if you die or fail to complete an interaction in the short time the game gives you

i cant recommend the game soe people may really like it and to be fair diving and catching fish and exploring the map is fun dealing with the sushi shop and the painfully sow unlock of upgrades due to the horrible economy balance not so fun

and a game advertised and often reviewed as casual should be fun and able to be played by everyone and this game is just not that it isnt what all of the online advertisements said it was what a good number of reviews said it was what the carefully edited lets play videos said it was and the devs and publishers trying to act like they are a small indie company is blatantly false

you are a masochist great youll love this game
you want a casual game about diving avoid its not that

i will likely keep playing in short sessions only because i am a completionist and want to get as many achievements as possible i will likely regret that urge many times over

quick edit to correct some serious typos

h3 stardew valley on steroids h3

dave the diver is an absolute gem that one must try if they love farmingrestaurant management games it excels in what it provides for the player it delivers a good but nothing outstanding in terms of story but it makes up for it in the characters personality and humour even without any voice acting you can imagine what every character would sound like which is unique 
the game is worth the price tag and i strongly recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience a relaxing game once in a while

#####

one of the few games where instead of showing you 3 gameplay mechanics at the beginning and spinning them for 30 hours you constantly stumble upon something new

this is not just a game but a whole world combining various game mechanics and genres the most pleasant and nonboring gameplay storytelling not stretched ideal for relaxing your soul

light pleasant calm beautiful peaceful kind and sincere
its a great rest for her which i wish everyone

#####

this game is a real pearl stylistic art and deep world building dive in for some fun creative and relaxing exploration this game will make you wet the only thing to be aware of is the time on the clock when you have been in the briny depths till 2 am it may be time to come up for air

#####

what an amazing game the interesting gameplay loop keeps you diving in for moreand just when i thought yeah this should be all that is to this game considering its price it just reveals another chunk of content or a new game mechanic that adds to the gameplay loopfunnily enough it happens over and over adding to the fact that this game is still in early access im just astounded at the amount of eventual content ill get once it hits full release the artstyle is very visually pleasing and the dialogue is humorousadd the borderline addictive gameplay loop and its definitely a game that gives you more than what youd expect at its current price point

#####

the games starts off very chill and slowly introduces you to new mechanics of which some speed up what you were doing previously but after a good amount of hours into the story you ultimately get sick and tired of everything you do because there are too many mechanics and each day becomes a massive chore rather than a nice walk through a cool story up to the point i dont want to play the game anymore but only know what happens next story wise

i now hate gathering fish managing the restaurant serving clients farming etc etc they couldve fixed this by changing the gameplay loop so you could care less about resources after youve done plenty of manual labor but the way it is structured now forces you to keep doing everything to keep progressing and it keeps adding more new stuff to do on top of it ridiculous really

and the worst part of the whole game is you ruin an entire day section if you die what even is the point of taking only 1 piece of food with you after dying reloading the save after altf4 is simply more worth which feels wrong why cant i just load inside the game its even more stupid than a soulslike game where you can at least get to pick up your souls where you lost them

#####

this game is awesome i wanted to buy it but then a generous friend gifted it to me the game is fun and there is just so much to unlock and explore im really enjoying it the art is beautiful the controls are pretty good the performance is solid i dont really have any complaints i had to look up a few things that i didnt understand but that could be my fault

okay after 82 hours i finished all of the achievements ill be taking a break now until the godzilla dlc

#####

sometimes less is more a crucial aspect of game design is adjusting the games length there must be a reason why according to statistics less than one in five players reach the end of the game i know it might seem odd to criticize a game for having too much content but this game really feels like one of those with a little bit of everything without excelling in anything
the game starts off at a pleasant pace alternating between dungeon crawling and a management aspect similar to what was seen in moonlighter but this balance is completely thrown off by the fact that a new mechanic is added every literally 10 minutes after 15 hours of gameplay mechanics continue to be added and the game feels like an endlessly long tutorial where you never reach the full state of the game
moreover the sea feels really lazy and artificial the environment exists only in function of your presence the world fails to give you that sense of immersion that in a game like rain world comes from the fact that the world goes on regardless of your presence you never see two fish interacting with each other one fish eating another or anything similar
furthermore the difficulty level of the boss fights is so low that it seems mocking
overall i think the developers should have focused more on the core mechanics of the game instead of continuing to add content upon content

breview after 100 completionb
h3dave the diver review a dive into coziness and culinary adventuresh3

boverview
b
at its heart dave the diver is a delightful mix of relaxation and adventure perfect for unwinding my journey with dave unfolded on the steam deck showcasing an impeccable match that hinted at a bespoke design for the platformdave even indulges in some steam deck action during load screens the game masterfully blends undersea exploration with the intricacies of sushi restaurant management offering a rich palette of side quests and minigames however the path to 100 completion marred by grindy achievements and rng dimmed its luster slightly still the vibrant graphics and nostalgic soundtrack whisked me back to the joy of childhood gaming cementing dave the diver as a mustplay for fans of cozy games

bgameplay 810b
dave the diver offers a unique undersea adventure in the blue hole where catching fish and completing a marine pokedex become as thrilling as battling bosses the progression from a novice diver to a seasoned shark hunter exemplifies a wellcrafted difficulty curve boss encounters blend challenge with fun more puzzle than punishment the sushi restaurant management surprisingly engaging adds depth with its dynamic customer satisfaction system though the fishing routine for restaurant stock can feel repetitive

on the steam deck the game performs flawlessly with intuitive controls and seamless gameplay that never skips a beat

with its charming pixelated visuals dave the diver pays homage to classic gaming with a modern flair the soundtrack is equally impressive offering memorable melodies that enhance the games ambiance lingering long after the screen goes dark

b100 achievement grind 610
b
the pursuit of 100 completion is where dave the diver shows its flaws certain achievements like gyao master and the rngdependent thors hammer introduce tedium and frustration the repetitive nature of some tasks especially in leveling up employees tests patience rather than skill

bconclusion
b
dave the diver is a gem that shines with its cozy gameplay engaging mechanics and heartfelt homage to gaming nostalgia despite its grindy moments the game offers a fulfilling adventure through its blend of action management and exploration with its pixelperfect graphics and captivating soundtrack its a call back to the simpler times of gaming making it a catch worth diving for

#####

i bought this game in the sale because of all the hype and now ive finished it i can honestly say i dont get it

theres not really any difficulty or challenge so its just about the story and exploration which was fun for about the first 20 mins but then became really tedious you keep going through the same locations over and over again slightly changed each time the story was just tedious as were the pointless mini games that formed part of it the gas cutter was particularly frustrating and the tamagotchi thing was really annoying

i dunno i dont think its a bad game but it really wasnt for me it was certainly very well polished if it looks like your kind of game sure go for it but if youre looking at all the reviews thinking that maybe you missed a gem dont buy into the hype

#####

i havent even finished this game yet but man you can tell this game was made with absolute love
its a fishing game a restaurant management simulator and a farming game all in one it is made up of many components but no component was left behind in terms of effort put in to make it high quality
this game is special and i cant recommend it enough


#####

i wish there was a maybe recommendation

dave the diver is a charming game with a lot of soul and effort put into it and you will enjoy first 10 hours while remaining time gets bogged down by repetitive mechanics and tedious management furthermore lack of coherence and unnecessary padding makes the game fall apart in later chapters

light early game mechanics spoilers below

pros
 fantastic art direction glorious cutscenes that made me laugh and good soundtrack
 the beginning cycle of divecatchcooksell is really addictive and will get you hookedhehe on the game
 restaurant staff and diving tool upgrades match the natural flow of the game making it more fluid and reduce the tedium
 i found variety of mini games and interactive story cutscenes charming some made me genuinely chuckle

neutral
 story is interesting and easy to follow yet sometimes blocked by lack of a particular diving suit upgrade which you will have to grind for
 tons of fish to find catch and collect with a handy reference guide on where are the missing fish located however your effort to 100 it or catch all fish  is not rewarded at all
 additional submissions that reward underwater collection are disproportionately demanding compared to the reward you get

cons
 no coherence in sushi menus there is literally no point in upgrading early dishes while dishes from fish caught later are almost always better even unupgraded
 pointless tasty food mechanic that only serves to block your rank up to next restaurant level and nothing else
 more and more gameplay layers are added that dont match the energy excitement and polish of sea exploration such as fish farm and vegetable farm and are a chore to do every ingame day
 minigames when catching a single fish are tedious there is accessibility option to make repeated presses easier but nothing about wiggling or rotating the stick
 enemies do way too much damage and are too fast for dave to circle around sometimes you get chunked for more than half health because you get hit once and then the enemys hit box lingers in daves hit box leading to more hits
 puzzle solving is constantly interrupted by dave telling you the answer to the puzzle
 if you want to be fast and snappy with your management mechanics prepare to be staring at 1015s loading screens every interaction steam deck at least

buy this game worth every penny

#####

this game is fantastic

the music is great
the story is interesting
the dialogue is very amusing
the gameplay is quite fun it can be relaxing just diving and exploring

the story is locked at a certain point planned for the rest to be in full release 

despite this the game is still great and worth the price

#####

after 25h of hey dummy go dive down and bring me this for only a small portion of story to be unlocked i got very bored
couldnt make myself finish this game 
this game while fun got wayyy too repetitive and grindy

#####

ill be upfront and say i havnt beaten the game as of me writing this review but its hands down one of the best games ive played as of recent

both calming and intuitive with how the game is played shows some real dedicated professionals put serious love into the development ill start with the calming factor of the game
the games feel is peaceful but under the surface has some really interesting encounters in the aftermath of your dives you have access to a sushi bar to show some well earned progression 
the intuitive flow of gameplay to progression is amazing occasional grind if needed story flows well with what you earn and overall gameplay is the best ive seen for the genre

now the combat is unique
the combat is a good portion of positioning due to only being able to shoot on a 180 degree both to the left and right and movement from enemies ways of attacking i wont go too far into it as its a learned thing

the combat mechanics works in an interesting flow of wound and capture or wound and kill or my favourite qte
wound and capture works for anything that cant be captured with a single harpoon shot relying on foresight
wound and kill is exactly what it sounds like but is actually the last thing you want to do normally in this game but cant be avoided with certain fish

now the qtes they are not annoying holy shit its a miracle
the qtes only appear when harpooning a weak fish that doesnt guarantee a capture now heres the cool part the qtes vary depending on the harpoon tip dont worry youll figure it out maybe an hour in and make it genuinely interesting to capture fish

overall my personal experience with the game so far has been amazing if you are longing for a game that doesnt have microtransactions a horrid grind and greed written all over it then pick this game up the price is in my opinion amazing for what you are given

hope this essay of a review was good enough to give a summary

edit oh yea i forgot to mention a good portion of this game can also be played on one hand only place you really cant is combat related but still thats dope

#####

this game is fun and i am enjoying it

#####

everything is on a timer i expected something more relaxing but instead its just rushing through one segment after the other its just not to my taste
you want to dive here are a couple of seconds before you run out of air
you want to cook  serve customers here are a couple of seconds per customer before the customer is unhappy 
its not fun to rush through everything its more stress than it should be

#####

excellent game

#####

a good video game

#####

i absolutely love this game its multiple parts fit together like perfect puzzle i cannot wait for the full release

#####

h1bthis game is a masterpiecebh1
in my opinion the whole game is quite successful almost throughout
lots of different tasks very good animations easter eggs varied gameplay good music etc the game does so many things right

h1bpositives bh1
story its definitely good but it also feels pretty standard in parts 810

soundssoundtracks are very well done there is a variety of music that perfectly fits the different moments 910

details there are so many small details and easter eggs from other games or even inspired by real people are very successfully incorporated with the characteristics belonging to the characters 9510

animations with the gameplay the strongest thing about the game there are a lot of animations that were made with a lot of love and just fit perfectly to the game 1010

gameplay the variety is extreme in this game the days are rarely monotonous and you are often confronted with new tasks that use different game mechanics and also fit very well into the game 1010

h1bnegativesbh1
 the only criticism i have are the bosses where all are very good but the balance is sometimes strange some bosses at the beginning are harder than those that come later a boss in the middle of the game is extremely hard in my opinion harder than the final boss 

 and the beluga you can use later outside the story feels a bit unnecessary especially when you have to pay for it

h1conclusionh1
i am very happy to have come across the game through the steam store page and can recommend it to everyone even if the graphic style does not appeal to everyone at first 
for me dave the diver is currently the best game that came out this year

h1910h1

#####

i think i fell for the overwhelmingly  rating there are lots of content that isnt really fun like minigames with gameplay worth of generic mobile games tap to run faster
its more a repetitive in a bad way gameplay focused in unlocking and upgrading stuff like a mobile game at least visual and sound wise is very beautiful the characters have some charm but it worns out quickly given how they are just bland charicatures


#####

great game with a very inviting community it has a lot of fun and random things that happen to keep you entertained

#####

this is the first time i take the time to write a review this long this game totally caught me off guard way better than i thought it would be i didnt have high hopes but from the fun gameplay to the hilarious moments and all the cool easter eggs i was hooked from the start to the end and it leaves you wanting more

id been on the lookout for a game to really grab me and dave the diver did it i was kinda skeptical when i downloaded it but dang it blew me away with all it had to offer this game quickly became my absolute favorite seriously its one of the best games ive ever played and i really hope more people get to enjoy it like i did

the games mechanics are not only cool but they keep getting updated so it never gets boring the devs really made a masterpiece that mixes awesome gameplay with a great sense of humor the game keeps things fresh with new stuff all the time its clear the devs put a lot of effort into making this game a blast  its got all the right ingredients for an unforgettable gaming experience

#####

masterpiece

#####

i never leave reviews for steam games ever i just finished this game and i want to cry it is so cute and wholesome and beautiful the gameplay is so addictive its varied and never gets stale i seriously sat down and played for 38 hours hardly putting it down buy this game its perfect

#####

well lets review this little gem shall we  ill try to keep it as spoilerfree as possible

b visuals b
dave the diver uses an unusual mix of 3d and pixel art and the low res textures on the 3d bits make the two mesh surprisingly well this makes the fish species easy to tell apart which is pretty impressive considering the sheer number of them and the environments just gorgeous while still looking pixel arty
the pixel art is absolutely beautiful and very well animated both for the gameplay sprites and the larger pictures such as character portraits the cinematics are just excellent you can tell the artists were having a lot of fun

b audio b
the soundtrack is extremely fitting to the chill ambiance of the game the only minor gripe i have with it is that some tracks get repetitive after 40 hours of gameplay maybe they will add some alternate tracks in the future
there is no voice acting but the sound design gives a very distinct voice to every character the other ingame sounds are also pretty solid

b gameplay b
the game manages to strike an excellent balance between letting the player explore at their leisure and introducing new mechanics even after 30 hours there are still some new small mechanics added keeping the gameplay fresh which i suppose is fitting for a game about fish
the main gameplay loop is split between the diving phase and the surface phase during the diving loop you explore the depths catch fish find loot all while having to manage your dwindling strikehpstrike oxygen bar and your inventory weight the swimming is very smooth and easy to get used to and again new small mechanics are added to fishing and exploration the deeper you go  such as weaponry equipment upgrades small qtes when harpooning uncooperative fish etc while some of the aquatic wildlife is aggressive most of it will just run away from you so again exploring is very chill
the surface phase is about managing the sushi restaurant which uses the fish you caught pretty straightforward right  well again it starts simple and gains extra mechanics as you get further into the game first its pretty much the chef and you you set the menu for the evening the chef makes the food and you serve it to the customers but as business grows youll need more staff then new ingredients then you get special events with a batch of customers who will pay extra for a certain kind of sushi yet all of it manages to stick together and form a very organic whole
the one nitpick i have is that the underwater puzzles are pretty simple and dave has a tendency to spoil the solutions by thinking aloud also playable tutorials for stuff like pouring beer would be nice

b writing b
the story is pretty good but what really stands out is the characters they are very well written and very well served by both the animation and sound design here you can hear the fire in usually reserved banchos voice when he starts talking about cooking you can hear the excitement in dr bacons voice when dave comes back to the surface with good news the characters are just the right mix of mundane and cartoonish to come together as memorable a special note to dave for managing to be an overweight protagonist while inoti being the butt of cheap fat jokes also before you ask no you cannot accidentally lodge a harpoon in spoilersuwamspoilers hindquarters
the game itself also have an excellent sense of humor with references to other games peppered in every other corner you can even get famous streamers and copyrightfriendly characters as staff members

b final thoughts b
i have a bad habit of focusing on the negative yet if im being honest the only negatives i could find here are nitpicks i only have good things to say about dave the diver it is beautiful fun memorable and it deserves a place in the indie hall of fame with the likes of stardew valley an excellent game if you just want to relax and catch fish

dave the diver isnt a bad game its not really a good game either its certainly not a 97 great game like the reviews make it out to be
it starts out pretty great you swim around collect fish its nice
then they add a sushi restaurant which you manage its a pretty sizeable addition to what you are doing ok cool
then they add upgrade systems ok now were rpging
then they add upgrade systems on top of other upgrade systems uhh
then they add night fishing then they add vip visitors then they add photos and pokemon cards and fish hatcheries and farms and kpop dance minigames and fish parties

it gets to be a lot the issue is that the systems dont play super well with each other  its so haphazard its like the devs had a game jam and tried to cram all the ideas into one product what started as a peaceful pretty fishing game becomes this frankenstein mess of systems that youre juggling all over the place just navigating between all the zones trying to do cram everything into a day becomes tedious

#####

i accidentally clicked new game when i was going to quit the game there was no pop up or anything  it just started the cut scene this caused all my saved data to be lost forever

#####

hilariously my first comparison for dave the diver were the old jumpstart games to be clear this game appears to have no intention of teaching you anything but where it is similar is that those old educational games built a universe for you to explore and then packed them with minigames and they would use a storyline to guide you from game to game this style of game has died off in recent years and i completely forgot how chill it is dave the diver is adult jumpstart without the learning

the game is amazing in every way so far i love running the sushi restaurant diving and exploring the ocean is a blast collecting new fish upgrading my equipment unlocking new weapons everything in this game is well thought out and rewarding to progress i have also been loving the music

this game is worth every cent they ask for

#####

chill beats

and 

hot and cold eats


i love sushi i love dave

waifu pillows for everyone

damn dave

#####

this is a very excellent game that came as a complete surprise to me and my friends im not a fan of restaurant management games nor do i have any interest in divingthe deep ocean thanks thalassaphobia but this game got its hooks into me and wouldnt let go for two straight days 

i havent beaten it yet but i believe i will in the next 34 hours 

so what is it about this game that won me over well not the first hour thats for sure i was downright bored initially every ingame day starts with your character jumping off their boat into the ocean usually and thus begins your diving adventure for the day you swim around while managing an oxygen meter which doubles as your health  getting hit by hostile fishenvironmental hazards drains your oxygen and when that runs out you ded and your goal is to slaughter and collect valuable fish to bring back to your sushi restaurant after your diving trip is done this was a cute little dynamic but i knew there was no way it would keep me interested for more than a couple hours

fortunately dave the diver agrees  and thats why it doesnt rely on that gameplay loop to keep players engaged

dave the divers strength lies in its ability to constantly surprise you have you played games like breath of the wild games where youre constantly learning about new systems and features and ways to interact with the game world dave the diver offers a similar experience

the game will shift and morph before your very eyes constantly make sure you do your main story and side quests and youll find that entirely new gameplay systems are revealed to you at regular intervals farming fish breeding seahorse racing restaurant automation trading card collecting roguelike gameplay progression with permanent unlockable upgrades weapon crafting exciting new boss fights and creatures there are so many mechanics and interlocking systems in this game that i genuinely struggle to name them all and only a handful of the unique ones were mentioned above

as you progress you will feel a sense of wonder and discovery thats rare in games these days 

and how can i forget the amazing art direction and character designs dave the divers characters are silly and fun and every character has a certain level of charm even the ones you might hate at first will probably start to grow on you the more you interact with them and dave himself is not a silent personalityless protagonist hes a big wholesome teddy bear that cares about his friends and those in danger and thats reflected in his dialogue as well as his animations 

the last major positive that comes to mind is the games custom fullscreen pixel art animated cutscenes these are beautifullycreated sequences that play for actions ranging from the mundane to the exceptional  they are not just reserved for major story moments the simply act of researching new dishes or completing a fetch quest will reward you with one of these gorgeous scenes and many of them will probably have you laughing out loud or spamming your screenshot key some scenes do eventually repeat for certain actions like researching new dishes but theres still a lot of variety here its almost worth playing the game just to experience those cutscenes

i dont often leave reviews for games but i strongly recommend dave the diver if youre like me and you dont find the core gameplay loop compelling initially thats fine keep going anyway focus on your nonrepeatable quests unlock more content and systems give this game a chance to surprise and delight you and it will absolutely rise to the challenge 

thanks devs i cant wait to see what you make next

#####

this game is worth every cent hours of content when you think youve uncovered every bit of gameplay they throw a new type of mechanic at you its not overwhelming and th content grows in a perfect pace

#####

instead of just one more turn this game features just one more dive and it may even be more addicting at first it is just a chill and relaxing diving game with some hectic sushi bar serving during the evening but the more you play the more it opens up never getting too complex it introduces more and more game mechanics that i didnt expect from this game at all the only con are some of the quick action mechanics that disturb the chill diving

bprosb
 great and surprising story and storytelling
 relaxing dives in a beautiful 2d pixel word
 hilarious characters
 lots of sushi
 quite a lot of boss fights with different mechanics some are also a bit hard needed 23 tries on at least 2 bosses
 more gameplay than you might expect 38h in not finished with the story and still soooo much stuff to do

bconsb
 some of the quick action button mashing doesnt fit too well with the otherwise relaxing game
 the theme is a bit hard when you know that sharks arent as evil and aggressive as they are shown here and fishing in general is a complicated story mini spoiler spoilerdoesnt help that the eco activist are portrayed as the evil guysspoiler

#####

for the last few decades ive been buying game after game trying to find something that gives me the same joy i had when i was playing games when i was younger and more carefree more often than not while fun for a little while they fall to the side either to repetitive to easy to hard to whatever

dave the diver gives me joy

other reviews are going to say the same thing because its true somehow they made a gameplay loop that includes elements that all seem like they should be frustratingbecause they would be in any other game after thinking about it for a while i believe i know why this game is great they somehow made it so that even if you fail you arent punished for it perhaps this changes later on but right now it feels like im always progressing even if something goes wrong

i am dave the diver

#####

best fishingdivingrestaurantfarming game ever made 1010

#####

just in case you think i am dissing the game let me make it clear that this is a fantastic game and i have been recommending friends to play it this is one of those games that is worth the asking price whether it is on sale or at full price 

as for my review however i like this game but i dislike the story it presents 810

i have done everything available in the base game except the newest crossover update with dredge the gameplay is really fun and i find it difficult to put the game down once i start playing buuuuuuuut almost every single npcs in this game who give you request for help are total jerkwads that makes fun of your character appearance and then expects you to help them for a reward like a good doggy anyway if it werent for completing the main story and achievement hunting i would have declined all those requests for help so damn fast not that you have the option to decline anyway 

see here is the thing dave the main character is a bundle of positivity that sees the good in everyone he is open minded and is willing to try new things out and gain new experience and he helps people even when they are mean or mistrust him spoiler and by the end of it all he gained these people trusts spoiler dave the diver showcases a more optimistic view on life and honestly if there are more daves out there this world would be a much better place the sad reality is however there arent many daves out there because it is hard to be a good person to be nice and understanding if i were put in daves diving shoes i would have had game over 3 seconds in game so i dislike the fact that a fun chill game made me self reflect and want to be a better person or at least say fck off strike more strike less often 

tldr we live in a society this game is great play it

#####

dave the diver is wholesome and totally silly through and through

strangely relaxing and always compelling low stakes gameplay wit a pretty wellmade loop
very thorough execution of the diving  restaurant sim mechanics slowly revealing more and more options as you progress around an irreverent retro bmovie type story

the game suffers somewhat from constant handholding and a rather gentle pacing but its not enough to hold back such a satisfying and very rewarding experience

#####

really fun experience and the funny cutscenes were well done

#####

it starts off as a simple game and surprisingly evolves into a product beyond my expectations its astonishing how many features and activities you keep unlocking as you progress through the game

the creative direction is amazing too the pixel art and music are beautiful theres also an interesting blend of 2d 25d and 3d art

game of the year

#####

such a great game i hope new dlcs comes out in the near future

#####

i played this before full release its honestly a great concept the story and visuals are very engaging sadly this game just is not for me but that doesnt stop me from acknowledging that this is something unique and cared for

#####

greatly recommend it even at this stage where the current content on early access has about 1215 hours of content i hugely recommend it as there is a lot to do keep in mind that is early access and you will get a wait for full release to continue the story mid way but the current content has a lot to keep you busy and it is worth the price 100

hrhr

h1for the goodh1 

 the artstyle is amazing lots of animations and lots of tiny details that give the game so much life

 a lot of diversity on fish and dishes for the sushi restaurant also for each new dish you serve you get some more art as the form of a social media post ingame

 the music is pretty good and i gotta say i never got tired of hearing it

 pretty much each section has a lot to do from ways to catch the fish to increase the card quality to customizing the store look or hiringtraining new staff spoiler theres also a fish farm where you can get more fish for the sushi bar or just to watch your fish like it was an aquarium and theres also an actual farm where you get to grow rice and vegetables for the sushi bar spoiler

 each new character you meet has some very distinguish personality and animations to them

h1this depends on the person playing it to find it either good or badh1 

 there is bway too much to dob and you have no downtime between content some people might find it good that you can just continue the story but for some other you might find it overwhelming to see the todo list always there for what you have to do next maybe some days between some events so you can focus on fish collection and improving the sushi bar

 bqteb all weapons and some bossesbig fish have some way of qte all different from each other and while it provides some fun for some it might be tiresome to mash spacebar or try to figure out the qte and failing a lot i got used to it quickly and i actually liked it but if you could change the keybinds it would improve a lot

h1now for the badh1 

 the bosses are way too easy at least in my opinion
 quality of the fish does nothing other than give you the golden card
 no way of changing the keybinds
 ba lotb of spacebar mashing
 upgrading the food does absolutely nothing on some dishes as there are way easier ways to get the big money big taste combo spoiler you can abuse this even more with the fish farm spoiler  and just spam those getting some bonus or more upgrades to dishes so you have to give variety would be great
 once you get a tv ad and upgrade some employees theres nothing more to do on the staff side and you just watch the money grow and i find it bad since you can do this very early game need more bar interaction or some ways of expanding since the bar is pretty much half the game

hrhr

overall the game is great and the overwhelmingly positive is well deserved even with the bad things i posted i loved the game 100 and had great 12hours of pure enjoyment im hyped and cant wait for what the next updates bring

#####

you can pet a whale

#####

dave the diver now boy this game was special the story was compelling and with each dive i lost count of time trying to explore the depths of the mysterious ocean while making sure i gathered enough ingredients for the sushi restaurant the characters too were well written

the art style was perfect for my liking with a blend of relaxing and sometimes creepy music i loved the atmosphere of every location the cutscenes were hilarious and very well donearguably the best in any 2d pixel game

i did not expect a divingexploration game with a mix of restaurant management to end up being my game of the year 1010 cant recommend it enough

#####

i dont normally go for early access games anymore  i would say around 90 of them that ive played have been utterly disappointing

this is not one of those games

what a lovely blend of early console underwater sidescrolling games like jaws on nes or ecco the dolphin on genesis and food serving games like cook serve delicious  the game itself is a simple concept dive to catch fish during the day make your fish into sushi and run your restaurant at night

on top of this there are a lot of crafting aspects such as makingupgrading your gear and weapons exploration of a randomlygenerated ocean each time you dive and customization of your restaurant  the best part  all of your tasks for the daynight only take a few minutes so you arent stuck doing any one thing for a long period of time  the game gradually increases in difficulty as well as rewards and there are plenty of things to keep you busy

this dialogue is very cute and tongueincheek and is one of the few games where ive actually enjoyed reading through it  

i can tell this game will be keeping me busy for quite some time and i cant wait to see where it goes  definitely worth the early access price

#####

indie goty for 2023 no question about it

#####

dave

#####

h1 just like a salmon roe sushi h1

lots of small elements coming together to pack a punch

you can dive and explore the great blue sea hunt  collect fishies manage a sushi restaurant unlock new weapons  upgrades run a farm and comes with main  side stories the game is still in earlyaccess but already offers a tuna wholesome fun

#####

this game is like a sanctuary in time where most modern games are poorly made and poorly optimized this game reminds me why i got into video games game that can give joy without asking you to give your wallet and nasa computer very great game highly recommend it

#####

i was so overwhelmingly disappointed in this game  as another good review said this is a game that gets in the way of itself and doesnt know what it wants to be  what is this game marketed as  a rogue like where you dive and fish to catch food for your sushi restaurant that you run at night  this sounds incredible  i will say straight away the restaurant management is perfect love it its so great i wish i could focus on it  in reality the game is filled with quests that start out just fine catch some fish explore new areas get some new tools kill some boss fish again pretty great  however it quickly devolves into a maddening never ending series of fetch and go to point a to point b quests filled in with random lacklustre one time mini games holy cow could the teeth pulling casino game be any slower  and extra features that barely need to belong  

i open up a fish farm but i have more than enough fish in my inventory already and i just bring back a full bag each time  i open up a regular farm to grow rice because a random customer wants better rice but i am already so inundated with fetch quests and different menus and load screens that i dont even want to understand what its doing for me  making me more restaurant money but its a diving and fishing game please let me just do that  

and thats the other part this game is roguelike in the sense that each day you empty your caught fish and start with an empty fish bag the next day  thats it  well fish are in different spots but its am ocean so that just sort of feels realistic  the game talks about the ocean being ever changing but i found about 4 different versions of the top oceans and then the rest all seems pretty much the same to me  seems they tried to do rogue legacys randomised rooms but instead as large layers or chunks  either way if the oceans different all i am trying to do is swim all the way to the bottom every day or all the way back up to find something for a quest 

and all of this really makes the games basic flaws so noticeable  movement speed is slow the in game ways to increase it are not enough its slow the entire game  fish are way too strong  i get it the big ones should take hits but when i am 14 hours in and the fish still take several harpoon shots followed by two tedious qte to catch it again becomes a chore to catch the fish that i need to run my sushi restaurant which is what i want to be doing but i am too busy bringing fish people books or food or finding balls or or exploring ruins above ground   as some random archaeologist guy  

i have no idea how so many people have enjoyed this game and review it as if it is as marketed a roguelike fish catching sushi restaurant sim because that is not what is inside

#####

an amazingly fun game
with a ton of mechanics freedom and collectible fishes

things that i liked the most
  bthe pixel artb thats all incredible animations and beautiful art without any flaws
  bthe music and sfxb be it ambiental music fighting music or the sfx it is good and the best is that it doesnt feel repetitive ata any point of the game
  bbanchob

things that i think that could improve or small bugs
  bug after arriving to 1112 likes in cooksta it stopped growing
every night after archiving that number when the report shows up it also shows how i have a smaller number and it grows repeatedly to 1112
for example previous count  1112  report  33 new likes  1079  1112 every night 
  i dont know if this was intended but in the glacier passage you get kicked out of the room before taking a photo of the mural in order to get all of the sea people murals photos you have to return and remake the puzzle and all of this can be quite annoying even more if you dont remember which mural you are missing
  i found that after the credits you dont have anything to do everything starts to feel lifeless quite fast
i think that adding some endgame missions characters or some new features more dreams the posibility to refight bosses maybe somehow going back to the past would do a lot of good

in conclusion
a fun game that throws a new mechanic or minigame that you have never seen every 3h of game aprox with an incredible art animations and ambientation with a simple but engaging history and some interesting characters

id rate it with a b8  10b on my personal scale that nobody cares for
dont drown

超出预期的一餐皮薄馅大的饺子

#####

i need more content 100h is too little the game is just too good

#####

contrary to the games marketing and what the first few hours of the game had me believe the exploration and management aspects of this game are underdeveloped after about 10 hours it became clear that this game is actually a storydriven action rpg with a bunch of tackedon minigames and as an rpg its not even particularly good theres lots of go fetch this macguffin and defeat the boss that ambushes you when you pick it up well not quite there is some variety in try to fetch macguffin #1 find out you need macguffin #2 but macguffin #2 is locked behind some other quest progression so complete that first

the boss fights are tedious and rely heavily on the playedout dodge the attack animation shoot the soft underbelly that appears briefly repeat until victory mechanic the defeat of each boss provided little sense of accomplishment and more a feeling of relief that it was over the ambushes are all predictable but the devs have written dave to be completely unsuspecting of them leading to some eyerolling moments such as one boss fight where you enter the boss zone via a dangerous creature ahead prompt but then dave says something to the effect of good thing this place is uninhabited later parts of the game world introduce some environmental puzzles but theyre very easy to solve and felt like filler the biggest challenge i had was trying to figure out what some qtes were asking me to actually do

the blue hole is very pretty but its small and despite the everchanging label in the marketing it hardly changes at all the roguelike elements are so minimal as to barely be detectable the sushi restaurant management gameplay is a fun hook at first but it turns out to be fairly shallow after progressing in the cooksta rating system it becomes purely a profit minmaxing enterprise on top of that the farming mechanics introduced later in the game feel more like tedious obligations rather than an enhancement to the gameplay loop the other minigames are rather boring and didnt compel me to play again after the game forces you to try them for the first time

some other relatively minor complaints i have combat controls are a little janky with the gun activation button being inconsistently responsive and the aim jumping after the activation animation completes there are forced dialogue portions during the sushi game where you waste precious time by being frozen while the game clock continues running the game does not fill the screen of an ultrawide monitor some hostile mobs will charge at you from offscreen

i think if i knew what the game really was going in i probably would have appreciated it more although i also wouldnt have purchased it

#####

game of the year move over ff16

#####

outstanding quite possibly my goty for this year very satisfying game made with a lot of love and charm

the game loop has three stages in the first stage you dive into the ocean catch fish and hunt for resources and treasures in the second stage you prepare your menu and ingredients from the fish youve caught and the third stage is a frantic series of minigames as you manage the nights business in the sushi restaurant

every part of this game is fun and satisfying to play and the little cutscene rewards for things like upgrading a recipe or unlocking a new one are lovely blowing a vip customers mind and seeing their cutscenes is a big delight too very shades of god of cookery

i have only one significant complaint about the game so far the gameplay loop gets interrupted constantly by special missions and more complexity that rolls out the game really needs to let me as a player just go have a calm chill fishing trip sometimes it feels like 75 of the first dives in the game youll make will get interrupted by more content which sure great but the baseline game is good enough let us sink into it more the pacing just feels too fast early on

anyway its a great game and im loving it i hope you will too
