with nearly 1000 hours on this game i can agree with some reviews that the late game is simply ridiculous  i can take all the land from a faction defeat their remaining parties repeatedly even capture and imprison all clan members and still have to pay vast amounts to obtain peace with them or else they raid my villages perpetually  the diplomacy is completely irrational i would love for these issues to be fixed  when you defeat an enemy they should dissipate instead of lingering to raid my villages until ragnarok  when an ememy is defeated they should pay me for peace  these things are realistic

#####

this is my first review on steam ever i felt it was kind of my duty to give my opinion on the game that i have personally been waiting for over 6 years as warband happens to be if not the one of my all time favourite games with around 1100 hours of gamplay  yes i know still rookie numbers compared to some other of its fans but still thats a considerable amount of my lifes time

so i have as of now played 63 hours of bannerlord and another 155 hours of the multiplayer beta of which i had the honor of being a part i now feel confident enough to talk about why i think that you should get the game yourself especially if you loved any of its previous titles

first of all the game is aesthetically a huge development from the awkward indie 2010 that even then still felt older graphics which we all grew to love the animations seem more realistic the items more detailed the campaign map is incredible and the scenery from the snowy forests of sturgia to the desert wastelands of the aserai homeland and from the rocky battanian villages to the great cities of the empire is beautiful and at times even dare i say majestic sure the graphics still dont compare to the other big games of its time and the character models still look a bit odd but for a game of a small company like taleworlds that chooses to focus more on the gameplay and the games mechanics you can at least overlook some of their flaws

i should also point out here that the game takes place around 200 years before the events of warband in a world where the calradic empire still exists although in crisis and new and old kingdoms arise in its wake some of the factions are the ones that evolved into the ones in warband vlandia is the predecessor to the swadians and the rhodoks sturgia is a mix between the vaegirs and the nords the khuzaits are the khanate before the rise of the khergits and the aserai the previous sultanate to the sarranids while we also have the battanians a celticlike mountain kingdom and the calradic empire an empire very similar to the medieval grecoroman now known as byzantine empire each of these factions is very well made in order to feel unique and different to the others with its own architecture clothing style and troops that are very close to their historical inspirations giving you a nice depiction of some fields of what the actual medieval world looked like and in some cases how it worked

now for single player on a first look youd say thats an enhanced version of warband and youd may be right for the most part but the game offers many new features and details that differentiate it from its predecessor examples of this are the many convenience options like the way you can recruit troops from villages and towns which can be more and better if you have good relations with the villages notables or the fact that you can see the full items stats and compare them to your own there are many new features like the clan and its mechanics basically you your family and your companions the fact that you can have children and continue to play as them once your older character finally kicks the bucket the forging system which allows you to make weapons and choose how they will look on your own the new kingdom mechanics that enhance the experience of serving or ruling a realm with multiple armies and kingdom laws and the fact that you can now kill nobles that you capture with whatever consequences that may entail other features have been renewed fixing annoying issues that existed in warband or completely changing the way they worked for the better like for example the new massive battles with more thought out aiplanning and the sieges that now have siege weapons and are not just a mass of angry people cramming a small ladder only to get violently killed by the other mass of angry people that awaits them on the walls

for multiplayer there are now 3 main modes which are skirmish 6v6 which is like battle and conquest together captain 6v6 which allows every player to command a small band of troops and siege which is the good ol siege we all know and love polished with siege weapons and some new mechanics there is also a team deathmatch mode which is more like a playground to prepare you for the real modes above now the way the combat works is almost the same as in warband with some minor changes like a shield bash move a crouch move and chain attacks and i feel like it is what we should expect even though i hear complaints about it being clunky and unreliable i personally enjoy it as i did in warband and id say it is highly dependent on skill and experience i believe its hard to learn and to master but once you do it offers you a very fun and challenging experience 

of course there are still many issues and bugs which make you question the fact that this is a game that was in development for 8 years and that it is priced as much as it is if you buy it now mind that you will come across a lot of them that being said you should also keep in mind that this is still early acccess and many of them are bound to change also you have to at least give credit to the developers for keeping track with the complaints and the feedback of the players having already made 10 updates during the first 1011 days since the release and continuing strong honestly the way they keep hunting for issues and bugs and the way they listen to negative feedback is all i could ask from a game studio which again is not a major one and if anything deserves my support in this journey of making the game that we all have dreamt and still dream of

overall and sorry for this lengthy essay the game is a worthy successor to warband it offers you a pretty similar experience that warband did letting you explore a vast world of different cultures and giving you the freedom to make your own story whether it is of the journeys of a merchant the adventures of a warlord the path of terror left behind by a bandit leader or the rise of a new ruler which is exactly what we should all have expected and hoped for and yet even as a game that offers content and possibilities the size and even significantly bigger than the size of warband it still feels like it has not even scratched the surface of what it is capable of leaving space to be filled in ways that we havent even immagined by the many and various mods that are bound to follow and have already started making their entrance by the ever restless and creative modding community of mountblade so if you have waited for this game like i have and still wonder if you should buy it in its current state id say yes join this journey because even if its not yet all you have dreamt of given time and support its going to be if you are new to mountblade and think that it is a little overpriced for a game that is not fully completed yet you can always wait until it comes out of ea but i would personally recommend that you give it a go and in the end you will be glad you did

#####

with 2192 hours in warband i think its safe to say that ive experienced my fair share of the classic warband experience that bannerlord is not only trying to emulate but also build upon with 15 hours in the game im already of the belief that taleworlds will not only achieve this end but surpass it

the game is buggy yes some of the bugs are obnoxious yes there are portions of content missing that are sorely needed not only is this true but the disappointment surrounding it is understandable after 8 years of waiting 10 for some this series has cultivated a cult following of dedicated and loving fans myself very much included who want nothing more than to dive head first into the game

but its very much an early access and anyone who finds themselves overly disappointed by the state of the game needs to remind themselves that it is still in its infancy even now the content included in the game is entertaining compared to warband combat actually feels weighty and adventuring around calradia has a heightened sense of danger and excitement to it side activities such as smithing allow for those interested in roleplay to create deeper stories for their characters and core mechanics such as trading have been developed and enhanced in this new release to feel far more responsive and rewarding

it is clear from the two very quick patches it has already seen that this early access is one that taleworlds are committed to building upon bugs will be worked out content will be added and i am firmly of the faith that the game will continue to evolve and take shape over the coming days weeks and months everyone is well within their rights to leave a negative review but i would encourage people not to damage the games rating unfairly as the current release is not indicative of the finished product

the thing that bannerlord needs right now is committed players to continue to highlight issues so that they can be resolved the framework provided to us now sets a good vision for the final product and i cant wait to see that vision be fulfilled

#####

historically speaking if you defeat an army 45 times your size you would usually win the war or at the very least stop the enemies from attacking you for a long time you will also have your name engraved into history with bards singing you praises and armchair military fans talking about how cool you are

in bannerlord its tuesday

crusader kings needs this game and this game needs crusader kings

#####

had my entire fortune poached by wandering looteres most of my men were killed those who werent died later of starvation and the only one to make it to a town was me where i was promptly ambushed by brigands who let me go because i was too poor at some point i realized id lived my entire life in poverty misery and eventually i decided to turn my life around

i became a blacksmith created some minor works  barely making a profit until one day when i made a sword that broke the towns economy everyone wanted my sword in merely a day id earned enough to purchase largess too grand for even kings then my life  so deprived in years gone by  was filled but still empty money begets money and violence begets violence eventually when i had conquered the world i knew nothing but stillness my clan was large and thus was my lot  eventually life was bleak if a man could have anything would he want for nothing or did it mean he could not desire anything as well 

then it was 3 am and i realized i had work in the morning

all in all ten out of ten would bannerlord again

a lord refused to nominate me for a castle after i successfully captured it so i switched sides tracked down his wife and chopped her head off 1010

great game who need 1 or 2 years of development tldr mid game turn into a micromanagment hell

the game is fantastic until a certain point you start as a mercenary one party 50150 soldiers doing missions small battles or bigger fights joining armies good graphics brutal engagments with 2001000 units at the same time if your computer can handle playing as a soldier is a blast

the problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime you have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues when your lords get captured  escapes theyll go into a random town until you pick em again then youll have to reform the party same with caravanes for trading if they get captured youll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan you have to partially fill towns with soldiers manually from your own soldiers all the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle as you cant delegate messengers are not a thing

you cant manage a town at a distance you cant tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory they do whatever they want if theyre out of your army  party so you have to do it yourself either youre leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight with various success some commanders are pretty good other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry protip dont be a recruit in an imperial army

you cant tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers its up to you or the ia if it feel like it worst if you let the parties you created roam around parties  group of 70200 soldiers under a lord they can be temporarily drafted in other armies of your kingdom and youll have to physically move to the army talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back of course large armies are slow this leads the the next problem swarms

my worst fear is not a massive army its an army disbanded in the middle of my territory the small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army raided villages impact your town  castle loyalty and gold quite heavily sure you could disband your army and hunt them yourself but that makes you take a step back and all your parties would reform under another army you cant control and man some army commanders are really really stupid verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers cavalry in a forest vs pikemens you name it i cant count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army but lets say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages

the capture system is broken captured lords escape a lot i had some escape 20 seconds after being captured they never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days once they escape they magically teleport to their hometown rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages ai cheat with recruits they will always find soldiers in town even if theyre empty for you executions you say

if you execute a lord no matter how much of an ahole heshe is the whole faction will hate you he raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants still not good enough you just cant kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line and youll need those lords to be friendly later worth to mention capturing the leader of a faction wont stop a war

last  peace  war is onoff i had 600 days of continuous war followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map due to a bug apparently and im now back at 300 days of war not a single day of peace when one war stop another start immediatly they will just never ever stop fighting cant catch a breath cant leave the front of your lose towns

oh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so

i would still recommand the game its really fun for a while but it need a huge qol update

h1mount and blade ii bannerlord reviewh1
explore raid and conquer your way across the vast continent of calradia making friends and enemies along the way raise your own army and lead it into battle commanding and fighting alongside your troops in the thick of the action 

basically its a game that lets you be whoever you want and do whatever you want within reason of course fair warning bannerlord is really light on story this is the type of games where you make your own stories about the adventures and challenges that you face


h1 questions you might have if youre interested in playing ith1

list
bwhat is it exactly that you do in the gameb
like i mentioned before bannerlord is the type of game that is more focused on the sandbox and simulation side of their gameplay rather than in the rpg sure this game offers you a deep character customization with dozens of background stories and classes each one with a play style associated with them along with this there is the classic stats gear and crafting system expected in modern rpgs but the whole point of the game is for you to look for your own fun looking for adventures and sometimes misadventures in the huge open world map that it has 

i personally played as an archer the charming son of a merchant and i spent most of my time with the game going around raiding towns and castles in order to get more resources to raid bigger towns and castles but i had seen people doing pacifist runs of this game or joining factions and climbing their ranks to become the emperor of the whole world my point stands this is the type of game where you make your own fun and the skys the limit on what you can do with the mechanics that the game offers you

b will it make my eyes bleedb
it looks a bit dated in some places and decent in others for example the top down view of the openworld map looks incredibly bland and simple maybe its just me who compares it to the total war games but the terrain textures and the map density feel like something from the early 2010s the game starts looking decent when you engage in 3rd person gameplay the armors npcs and buildings dont look so bad a bit dated for modern standards but since this is an aa size game i will give it a pass

something that i love from this game are the animations that the characters do during combat you can feel the weight and impact behind all the attacks its something hard to describe with just words but it helps the combat feel great and like i said before its my favorite part of this game

historically mount  blade games never were good lookers and this game is a huge improvement over the previous installment but i honestly believe that for the 50 that this game asks for it should have looked way better

bdoes it have a good storyb
doesnt apply this game virtually has no story

bdoes it have a good soundtrackb
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvl_ksqhx_rdc

its all orchestral songs that arent that catchy or memorable the ost is not particularly good or bad but it gets the job done 

bdoes it have replay valueb
tons of it from the multiple combinations of back stories and stats that you can get to the random encounters that you can find in the openworld and the multiple weird and niche play styles and builds that this game supports you easily can get dozens maybe hundreds of hours out of this game

bdoes it run wellb
no complains on this from me on this front i maxed out all settings at 1080p and got a smooth 60 fps all the time i didnt find any major bugs or glitches in my 30 hours play through of this game

bis it funb
yes but only if you are willing to tank through the inherent jankiness that his game has
list


h1 so what is mount  blade ii bannerlordh1
its probably the best medieval life simulation that lets you siege castles that exists on steam to date but it is also a game that looks somewhat dated and has a huge learning curve the amount of amazing and deep mechanics that bannerlord offers you is sometimes overwhelming from the whole banner system that gives buffs to you and your army to how complex the diplomacy and trading systems are and how it lets you do all kinds of crazy and fun stuff this game sometimes amazes me there is simply too much to learn and do this is a good problem to have in your game bannerlord luckily has a tutorial that explains the base mechanics of the game but it is lacking in some aspects i had to look for guides to understand enough of some mechanics to not get myself humiliated on starting areas

something that i hear a lot when someone mentions the mount  blade games is how fantastic the combat system is and well its going to depend on what you expect of a modern rpg combat system i can admit that like most of the mechanics of this game it has a somewhat stiff learning curve and it has a lot of complexities that makes it deep and strangely addictive i also mentioned before how the animations give it an extra feeling of weight and impact but i cant ever shake up the feeling that it never really clicked with me i think its because its slower than most modern action rpgs out there but im not quite sure

for me the moment that i understood why this game is so widely praised despite its shortcomings was when i was besieging a huge castle and i found myself in the middle of my army giving them orders and trying not to die this is not the type of game where you can fight 5 to 10 enemies at once in bannerlord you have to be tactical and smart in order to beat just one enemy and watching the whole carnage around me it felt real it felt like i really was there bannerlord is probably the most immersive game that i have ever played it encapsulated perfectly what it is to live in the middle ages with all their ups and downs and never forces you to do anything this is a niche experience that you cant find anywhere else


h1 things that i like about this gameh1

list
deep combat system

fun and complex sandbox mechanics

its the best sieging simulator out there

great rpg mechanics

amazing mod support everything on my dislike list can be fixed with mods
list

h1 things that i dislike about this gameh1

list
its janky

no story at all

the graphics are a bit outdated
list


h1 is this game worth my hard earned moneyh1
chances are that if you like the mount  blade series you already own this game and you have several hundreds of hours of play time in bannerlord so if you like games like the total war series and you dont mind janky games that look like the early 2010s buy bannerlord on sale its a game that offers you an experience like no other game on steam has but 50 is a hard sale for me at the time of writing this review bannerlord gets regularly updated and the devs constantly add more content

rating 810

great game started playing during the second lockdown finished the game to the point of having my own empire reaching the ability to fight multiple wars with over 380 troops in my personal army ambushed by groups of 8001000 and held small passages with 150 fian champions a shield wall and just enough cavalry to route the enemy 

had every companion in my personal bodyguard unit and was run down by a flanking cavalry charge most of my unit was dismounted we had to fight our way back to our line ordered our shieldwall to take tremendous losses to get us back into the fighting creating a tusudo square formation around the companions and bodyguard unit while we fought against the 2 v 1 odds realistic difficulty 

lost 90 of my army most of my companions but we won that battle 

when we get out we siege the enemy castle with just enough soldiers to push the ram we knock down the reinforced doors and engage in a skirmish the companions start to fall members who were with me from the beginning my troops are outnumbered holding a small room near the gate the balance of power is slowly creeping in the right direction we are down to the last 20 enemies we have 9 of us left holding the doorway the best that we can 

i take a javelin to the head instant ko my units keep fighting my bodyguard with insane leadership and tactics reforms the wall and finds 30 or so troops that i mismanaged to come around and flank 

i watch the battle incapacitated the units left on our side is under 10 the units left on there side is under 10 we get to 3 each companions vs enemy leaders my wife is one of the companions my brother nogrand is the other the last companion is a surgeon who somehow made it this far he dies but not before he throws a perfect javelin and takes one of the enemy commanders nogrand and my wife are melee specialists almost maxed fighting stats with pillaged level 6 weapons they hold they wound both the last commanders 

we take the castle executing the commanders but this isnt over we 265 wounded an effective fighting force of 2 with my character health at 1 are about to come under siege from a nearby army 

the nearby army sets the castle under siege hours turn to days the army of 600 is ready to fight and in the distance i see our last hope i see the first lord i recruited in my battle against the empire the lord i spent years chasing as a mercenary relentlessly beating in battle to gain charm points he with an army of 400 is charging this way in what looks like a rally to protect his king his commander his lord 

he stops and watches my no save death on realistic campaigns final moments he sits there watching this enemy army take down our walls with trebs and in the last second just as they start to storm the gates my number 2 my favourite lord just sits there 

we lose the campaign we fight to the end and with a valiant last stand my party is killed in battle it is over my sons killed my wife murdered and staring at my 300 hours campaign satisfied that the next time im going to behead that lord and his entire family the first time we meet until next time

short version if there was a tentative recommendation button id be using it it very much depends on the person because while most people praise the game there is a serious contingent that have reasons not to 

the company has a history of promising big things and then using a second game to finish fulfilling them if that turns you off i dont blame you it doesnt bother me as long as the first game is good in its own right but i can agree that we shouldnt have to buy a second game to get what was promised 

its a good core for a game but there are plenty of bugs ive seen i tried walking the streets of baltikhand and had a ctd while loading them in i repeated the process to verify that the crash was a consistent thing so stay off the streets of that town and just hit the trade and recruitment screens there im having issues with attribute points not being given to me at every third level like theyre supposed to be im sure itll get fixed but as of this review i havent seen it happen also having a hard time leveling up charm skill despite following the instructions given in the tooltip not sure if its a true bug or if the tooltip isnt telling the whole story ill have to wait and see 

all that being said i adore what this game is doing with the series we have families now not just a marriage for an alliance but an actual clan with potential for children and a brother built right into the story were the head of a clan not just a nobody adventurer making it on their own its very crusader kings ii to me and im loving everything i get into 

theres even a politics system where we can spend influence to vote on land assignment and we can spend that influence to put laws up to vote that have actual impacts on the stability and power balances within our kingdoms being a vassal doesnt just have to mean warring we can use our built in influence to do politics as well 

overall i love it if youre on the fence and dont want to spend 40 or 50 dollars on it yet wishlist it watch the patch notes and see how it looks when it goes on sale for real for the rest of you i understand the hate and dont blame you i just dont share it and i recommend anyone with an interest at least keep an eye on it

update 400 hours in and almost a year after release theyve done a lot of bugfixing theyve also done a bit of fleshing out and adding in features i can definitely say ive already gotten my moneys worth from it and ive been youtubing it as well it still suffers some problems from the old games so far the combat gets samey and isnt all that balanced there seems to be a big tendency toward telling things rather than showing them proper and this isnt helped by gameplay and story segregation though i could honestly see the gameplay and story segregation being intentional there is a main quest chain with a story to it and theres room to interpret that quest as pretty much poking holes in a lot of the flavor text again not sure if intentional and if it is its not really that smart a move on their part but its there if you want to read into it

im still giving the game my tentative yes if you like the series and just want more warband this is definitely for you if not keep watching or look into other games

#####

one of the best war games ive played plus i used voiceattack for voice commands i felt like a field general lol wife thought i was nuts

#####

1010 would go to war again 



#####

this game is like a time machine you sit down with the intention of playing an hour or two and then suddenly its five in the morning

#####

wait 10 more years for final release to truly enjoy this grand game

the reason to buy for me was not so much to play it now but to learn to mod it and enjoy it later with some fine full conversion mods its an investment in the future really

the gameplay is a mixed bag atm

h1the goodh1

the main game loop feels pretty polished and satisfying

combat is great challenging a bit better than in warband

smithing is an amazing crafting minigame and one of the best new features of bl you smelt refine discover new parts and explore new unique weapon combinations as you make your own gorgeous weapons make some of the best most beautiful weapons yourself and use them to chop chop smash smash thanks for that bl

the ui now allows for easy micromanagement significant quality of life improvements here

h1the not goodh1

the whole game is vanilla rough unbalanced

some mechanics dont work yet or work poorly like dont try to get your brother married it wont work dont get married dont save your brother you can but you might not be able to access their inventories

main quest can be impossible to complete you can only complete as vassal the game doesnt know you are an independent faction when you are in fact an independent faction

troop trees are rough and basic and copypaste vanilla values uninteresting to explore

characters can be missing impossible to find stuck in some castle while in fact are not in that castle the game points to location a when in fact you can find them in location b somewhere probably near location a or not

characters can sometimes be teleporting around like nonsense

smithing which i like a lot is beyond op and completely crazy broken mild spoilers at least for now until they fix their sht spoileryou can smith 2 handed swords level up smithing like crazy sell dozens to kings at half price or so and make easy millions or buy the best gear in game and hundreds of horses by trading just 12 swordsspoiler

while workshops are very hard to figure out make very little and most will not make any money at all as in zero

kingdom features are broken or questionable like clans which are now your vassals they are a mess instead of getting autooffers from ai clans are hard to get easy to lose and unfairly destroy relations this makes kingdom almost impossible

peace offers from the ai will not happen but you can buy peace with money and since money is not an issue atm its just silly

parties are poorly maintained ai armies that you pay for they do not autorecruit but will get themselves captured and will waste valuable troops

sieges have various issues like 1 guy unreachable forever will make you fail the siege troops management is a mess broken walls could be more like messy bottlenecks but sometimes are simply turning a siege into a field battle aka not much sieging gameplay if you simply break walls opening gates from the inside is tough but when it works its silly and op i also had a few crashes after sieges

most castles are not yet in game there are just a few and a ton of copypaste so not much interest in sieging the same castle again and again

xp seems pretty broken its extremely easy to get to around lvl 1315ish and then pfff xp requirements for companions are simply broken they will not lvl up not this century at least you finish the game and they are still 12 lvls away from where they started

executions are a questionable feature that simply splits the game in either you do it play a quicker much simpler and more repetitive game make a ton of enemies potentially ruin your character ruin diplomacy be forced to go down the genocide path and bypass any reason to siege or make a kingdom or not do it play the long game of building good relations with the nobility but miss all the murdering fun secretly wish you could do it and cry yourself to sleep every night and end up in a mess with your kingdom anyway the problem here is you can easily lamify the game by executing all nobles and instead of a juicy rewarding emotionally messy and mechanically complex end game you just chop chop chop chop chop the end

the ui again needs more clarity focus better framing better organisation less clutter more consistency and polish upgrades are hard to figure out at first a bit odd and the grey shield icons over the skills that can upgrade are simply not visible enough they should be colorful bright glowy animated with a color that stands out personally i prefer the grid structure of the warband inventory

the frequent entirely useless and poorly designed autosave doesnt async save in the background it freezes the game for a few seconds you cant turn it off

and for now some crashes may happen depending on how you play and what you may try

last but not least press n to access the encyclopedia there should be a large button for it in the main uiworld view its essential

cheers

only option now is to retire to a cave in the mountains and live the rest of my life as an honorless hermit while my governor brother and his children try to salvage our clans name in a dying kingdom 
hrhr

started out as a friendly wanderer with a heart of gold ended as a disgraced war criminal forced to retreat to the mountains and live the rest of my days hiding out in a cave reflecting on just how quickly the quest for power degraded my moral compass 1010


#####

update 1 6420  devs have been aggressively patching the game since release this is more than great news if they keep up the good work well probably have a fullyfeatured working game much sooner than anticipated


ok lets be real

this is a 2014 early access game that was released in 2020 

i love it its buggy its mount and blade its love 

buτ

1game is buggy so buggy that you should not only save often but also in multiple saves cause there are many many gamebreaking bugs that force the player to start over if theres no other way to avoid loopholes

2game is not only unfinished but also feels not properly tested too several bugs and missing textures are noticable right from the start while the game is still on rails before moving onto the sandbox gameplay you just cant miss those things with even bare play testing to prove my point i wanted to visit a castle to see how it looks like so i visited sestadeim guess what sestadeim castle exterior was exactly the lycaron city this is just alpha material

music is heaven i believe its more or less 50 of the games atmosphere

graphics are gorgeous for a mount and blade game ok for a 2020 release lighting kinda feels weird and fake but thats just personal opinion generaly im very pleased

my advice

while its playable its still very far from a steady release if youre ok with that and you think you have the stamina to replay the game several times untill its ready and then some then get it cause its freakin awesome its mount and blade 20 but if you think youll exhaust all your interest and youll soon burn out before the game comes into glory then you maybe should wait for a while and see what happens 

i hope as review score now will slowly start to lower after the hype trains gone taleworlds will continuestart improve their game for the sake of everything

back into the game

#####

mechanics is good but the world feels lifeless and it lacks immersion

#####

tried recruiting awesome general
he said no
beheaded his wife and daughter and married him to my sister
had to join my army through marital obligation
next time say yes when i ask nicely

is the game good let me tell you about my first single player campaign

im just starting learning how to play but doing pretty well got contracted as a mercenary for the northern empire and making a name for myself figure the time had come to settle down and have children with a respectable lady to carry the clan name forward after i perish so i start visiting different castles to see the ladies at court

they all snub me you simply arent of sufficient means blah blah blah you must rise much higher at court before id consider you for marriage blah blah

okay forget these picadilly snoots then

i devote myself entirely to winning tournaments honing my fighting skills training my troops i end up roaming out towards the fringes of the empire chasing mercenary work and meet the khuzait mongolianthemed clans intervene in a few battles earn their khans favor get a dialogue option to propose marriage between our clans and it succeeds the khan offers me his daughters hand in marriage

lolwut there aint no way this must be a joke bet shes one of those fd up looking npcs with garbage stats anyways right

nope

she is a babe warlord princess with amazing stats and traits to potentially pass on to our children my hands are shaking as i critsucceed the dialogue persuasion checks we marry and shortly after i am offered a fief and lordship by my liege in the northern empire  everything is too good to be true

my ragstoriches story took me from a nobody mercenary with nothing but a horse and a sword now i have my own castle 120 menatarms married a khuzait warrior princess who is now carrying our first unborn child and i have a warlord fatherinlaw who will literally send forth his hordes to demolish anybody who messes with me

1010 why did i hesitate to buy this game

#####

i feel like a lot of people here forget what warband was like or how different warband was compared to the original mount  blade warband offered some added functionality multiplayer and something of a narrative but was effectively the same game as the original even with the diplomacy mod the marshal ai was atrocious marshalling fickle ai lords was even worse and the limited amount of quests were far more than frustrating you cant pay me enough to herd zigzagging cattle to armies to deliver inconsequential messages across the map or to fight up and down 80 degree inclines ever again 

even in earlyaccess bannerlord is arguably the best medieval simulator on the market making it more than worth its value at its current price point the influence system alone is a godsend no more dedicated marshals and no more soliciting every peer in the realm for votes influence controls votes policies marshalling and maintaining army cohesion i love it 

the tactical game is unreal gone are the days of swadian knight charges the game is now about holding the high ground giving your archers a line of sight using your cavalry to harry and flank and maintaining infantry line discipline especially in battles with 800 men the maps make combat even better bridges cresting hills narrow valleys river crossings rolling sand dunes and more each of these terrain types demand different tactics 

fighting is a lot more fun than in warband twohanded weapons are an art the animations are satisfying to watch as well spear a guy from the front and he flies backwards shoot an arrow into a guys neck and he grasps at it before falling to his knees dead ring a guy with your glaive and he spins around in the direction you struck him fantastic 

i dont know what all this talk about wasted hours is about crashes maybe i havent suffered a crash for about 20 hours now it last happened when i succeeded on the first of two persuasion attempts to marry the khergit heir the crash occurred because i opened the dialogue box through the army panel no big deal i disbanded the army after i finished a siege approached the khergit heir afterwards and proceeded as planned we have a kid now and his name is junjad but i affectionately refer to him as junchad ive only encountered one or two bugs that i couldnt work around which makes this earlyaccess release more than playable in my eyes  

the only thing i truly dislike about bannerlord is the defensive siege game it needs a lot more work offensive sieges can be fun though but they too need some work eg laddered siege towers are useless i suggest cracking walls with four trebuchets after racking them up in reserve for the best experience

lastly i find the emergent gameplay qualities to be superb ive rolled two characters first with the battanians and now with the khuzaits ive adopted my own roleplay rules over recruitment executions and lofty ambitions each time and the game enables that i once got shot off my horse and was about to be swarmed only to command my cavalry to sweep in and save my life as if i were jon snow too much fun ive noticed some women die from childbirth making lords bachelors again feels like a real breathing world itd be nice though if lords and ladies killed each other every once in a while seeing as they breed like rabbits but im sure thats to come 

ive waited a long time for this game and i am beyond happy with it so far it reminds of me of ck2 back when it was first released  a great game with the potential to become a masterpiece thankfully talewords doesnt make any other games this is it with 100 employees the potential is there i wouldnt hesitate to buy as a former warband player as a newcomer with different expectations maybe its worth waiting for the full release up to you if you want to have fun now or later

#####

just opened the game and it was suddenly 2 hours later

#####

wish this had coop

#####

i wish they made a mount  blade where the campaign can be coop i have so many friends that would love this feature and i feel it will add a deeper level of role play

#####

so after my first 144 hours in game i have decided that the early access has a really strong foundation

bthe goodb
the graphics are nice combat is excellent including horse movement and weapon use the battles are excellent including formations and orders sieges are much more improved from warband with the addition of optional siege equipment the towns feels alive the factions are interesting and feel different culturally
i like the leveling up system it feels pretty free and not too complicated with some nice benefits to putting time in to skills you are using in a way you enjoy the game anyway trading is fun and a good way to make some cash though the economy needs work as a whole talked about below
i prefer the sandbox mode over the campaign mode as it just plonks you in the world alone without a main story much like warband though the story is fun the first time desptire the tediousness of constantly getting repetitive quests
your family tree is also amazing getting a spouse having children watching them grow up start families for themselves eventually dying of old age and having your child take over is very immersive

bthe badb
smithing needs a rework as its really overunderpowered depending on what you are currently making though its necessary due to the below
while i like the clan system over all it needs some work mechanically for instance allowing lords to join you despite their clans intentions this could work either as the lord forming a new clan or they are put in a rogue lord category until they are back in the same faction as the leader of their clan

bthe uglyb
ithe economy is absolutely trashi you cant make enough money naturally to achieve any of the necessary goals smithing cheese pretty much has to be used to balance the lack of money required for basic mechanics this ties in to below
idiplomacy is also absolutely trashi the way you end a war is just throwing a random lord 150k gold to stop it no negotiations or agreements between the leaders of each faction which is a step back for warband or your council can just agree to pay a daily tribute to stop the fighting again without agreement from the enemy you are paying tribute too 
also lords can just get auto ransomed or escape very easily without your say or ability to stop it this means that during a siege for example you can defeat a lord capture them then have them come back with a new army during the same siege that is a mess you should be able to lock people up forever if you so want or at least only have it so another lord breaks them out or a tiny chance to escape based on the security of the settlement

bsummaryb
in its current state the early game is incredible the midgame is fun but the lategame only is really fun if you are a vassal having your own kingdom just isnt fleshed out yet

i think the game could be pretty easily perfected by removing the economy aspect from the diplomacy aspect not having to bottleneck the game with silver and instead having diplomacy work on merit and situation alone would improve the game tremendously

edit spelling mistake

the game is still technically in early access so there are a few things missing like endgame kingdom functionality and some dialogue options for companions but overall its entirely playable in its current state

coming from warband this game is a true successor that improves upon the previous game in several ways those who are fans of the previous game will find much that is familiar to them here proxies for different western powers in the land of calradia each with their own cultures strengths and weaknesses and the ability to aid or hinder them there are some quality of life improvements as well such as the ability to speed up map time by 2x and food not rotting towns and castles too feel much more fleshed out though like in the previous games there is no real need to walk around them and you can avoid doing so the whole game given you never buy a workshop

on top of that there are some amazing additions most notably smithing which allows you to custom create weapons how you see fit and some others like siege weapons 

some aspects of previous games become much more commonplace here namely tournaments and trade now tournaments provide unique items in addition to the gold you bet and trade is much easier to get involved in and serves an important part of the beginning to midgame all in all much of the game has been smoothed over and polished retaining much of the older warband feel while still being an improvement in most areas

last but not least the combat for all the improvements to the base game mentioned above combat remains one of if not the largest draw to the series i have to say they did a damn fine job at it too the combat here is so satisfying warband was fun and it functions much the same here but like everything else it has been improved upon hits feel a lot meatier as you ride by and cleave someone in twain with a polearm from horseback duels feel much more tense as weapon handling has been refined and troop controls have been improved with the ability to select different formations as well as delegate troop command to the ai sergeants the battlefields look gorgeous although with noticeably repeating layouts and the large scale battles are breathtaking

a pattern is repeated here where troop commands were present in previous games but not quite as fleshed out or as central as they are here the only thing i miss is the ability to tell troops to advance or retreat 10 paces as well as the fact that the ai seems to have much more fine control of the troops than i can possibly manage

all in all the game is great so far as a warband junkie it feels like much the same game only better in almost every way the economy feels more involved game mechanics more polished and the combat more exhilarating 

i cant wait for mods

#####

b its almost harvesting seasonb

utldr it tends to crash the balance is broken and many systems are being worked on and implemented but these issues that every early access game under the sun has pales in comparison to the sheer scope depth scale and fun of the most ambitious medieval sandbox game to release in the past decadeu

warband cranked to 11 not without its problems crashes and broken balance as an early access game but even with bannerlord modbombed i experience significantly less crashes and issues as of 120 personally bget the community patch with vortex mod manager or install manually simple and easy installation that will make your gameplay significantly more stableb taleworlds even borrowed some of the most popular mods made for warband and incorporated them straight into vanilla bannerlord 

infantry bouncing off shield walls archers blotting out the sun with volleys of arrows cavalry charging with spears couched headlong into the breach and trebuchets reducing castle walls to rubble all of which in real time with hundreds of units on screen at one time every unit is a single entity that responds to reacts to and fights another unit or you lines will break from morale depletion attrition will occur if your or other lords morale is not managed stratagems from any of your favorite swordandshield rtss will translate seamlessly to the battlefield in bannerlord it is quite simply an rts with your own boots on the ground if you wish there is also autoresolve

player combat is not only refreshing but frankly fun as hell every aspect of combat has been improved upon from warband from graphic fidelity to combat mechanics to animations although not hyperrealistic swordfighting and weaponplay is addictive you will find yourself chasing looters for days just to sstomp them for the fun of fighting and the plunder bhighly highly recommend xorberaxs cut through everyone mod cleaving a handful of units with a broadsword on horseback is not only more realistic but makes you feel truly as powerful as you probably should be lategameb

the ui is being worked on but there are glaring improvements in all aspects of menu navigation from warband cities castles and fiefs now have a stylized and more aesthetically pleasing menu card and notables have portraits at the top of the menu which allow you to teleport straight to them to eliminate manhunting important people to talk to troop recruitment is also much more visual and allows you to select specific units how many units you are buying displays your current party size and lets you know when you are over your limit

fully dynamic world economy with shifting supply and demand that responds directly to not only your trade but the ais as well becoming a medieval capitalist has never been more engaging and rewarding flooding a city or region with a certain good will affect its demand supply lines can be cut if peasants are intercepted while dropping goods off in cities caravans can be plundered en route to their destination yes even your own and sieges can block cities from receiving goods all of which potentially affecting your workshop caravan and city revenue 

keeping the scope of the world economy in mind the game world itself is absolutely fing massive there is a ridiculous amount of cities fiefs and castles to visit plunder or do trade with all of which operated under the guiding hand of their respective owners kingdoms span for miles upon miles maintaining their borders while wrestling for control with each other there are plenty of kingdoms all of which moving gold and waging war dynamically with each other constantly and within these kingdoms smaller bands of warriors reside small fiefless clans wander their territories and can be fought or brought into your eventual kingdom even still bandits and looters scurry from treeline to treeline and along the foothills of mountains to stash their plunder at their raidable hideouts peasants and caravans make haste for their destinations to keep the gears of the economy grinding the game world feels alive and organic at all times a mark plenty of games miss 

maintaining relationships within the realms is important because as is clear from the above you will be the smallest fish in the pond for a good length of time there is a much heavier emphasis on relationships now much more than warband some people wont even talk to you or will not allow you to accept quests if you are not on good terms with them the amount of troops you can recruit from notables is also affected by relationships and they will even deny you troops if you are not on good standings 

fief and city management is much more hands on as there is plenty to build and improve within them the management is accompanied by ui elements that help you visualize what you are building and will allow you to mouse over them to reveal what exactly each building does siege oriented buildings add depth to castle and city defense allowing you higher garrisons more militia and increased siege build speed 

solid usagebased skill system think skyrim that builds organically through gameplay relevant to applicable skills ride your horse to level up your riding skill etc no dumping points into skills after reaching another level just so you can eventually play how you want type of progression 

you are not dovahkiin or some imperative prophet to the balance of the universe you start exactly as any lowly swordforhire would in the medieval period with a few weapons relevant to your characters starting skills horse the clothes on your back a small coin purse and no clout whatsoever people will only know your name once you begin making ripples within the realms of the world or once you begin collecting battle scars lords will politely state they have no idea who the f you are if they have never heard of you

although official tools unfortunately have not been released to the public just yet the extensive modding support stitched into the game offers far more than warband could taleworlds really listened as the game was built from the ground up to be modded to high hell planned mods in development range from got mods to lotr mods warhammer 40kfantasy mods please and thank you a lot of the true potential for this game lies in the modding support and community the game is already great out of the box bbannerlord is constantly being rebalanced as taleworlds continues development but at the current state of the game i would highly recommend balance tweak mods as the game in vanilla is still incredibly grindy even with the latest rebalances plus as the vanilla game balance is found and saves tend to be unstable sometimes its a lot more feasible to build quick with the mods learn the mechanics of the game and to start anew once you have a different or refined playstyle in mindb

everything in the game is value based which insures you are on the same playing field as other lords within the game for the most part for instance with modding you cannot mod one aspect of the game simply for your own benefit if you raise the general income of cities with tweaks ai will reap the benefits just as you will

this game is early access and many of the systems within the game are planned to be even more fleshed out more systems are planned to be added into vanilla entirely 

there truly is no comparison within the medieval sandbox genre the size scale funfactor and sheer addictiveness of this game dwarfs any other title within the genre this game is one of the few true sandbox experiences on the steam store and should not be overlooked merely because of the early access label

h1prosh1
already playable despite early access
fun combat
decent graphics
good foundation in place

h1consh1
missing some key features from prev games
not quite polished yet

h1play on your own accordh1
openended gameplay is where mount  blade ii bannerlord or any mount  blade really shines the most you start off with customizing your main character choosing his background or origins from a multitude of different ways did he come from a poor middle class or noble family was he a known troublemaker good samaritan or just a smart scholar there are tons of options of customizing your character background and he also gets his starting skills from these

aside from the starting quest to get you up and running the game just tosses you out on the open what to do next depending on your own no main quest lines be a merchant trader mercenary bandit lord soldier even founding your own kingdom is possible i havent got to it yet but ive read that if your character dies you can choose your heir and that heir will continue the story and be your new character i wish more games had this neat feature

with everything being bigger than ever the towns castles npcs as well as the improved ui the game feels more like a proper rpg now im getting witcher 3 vibes from this game especially when roaming around in towns or villages riding a horse

h1if it aint broke dont fix ith1 
unlike a lot of sequels that try hard to change the formula or revolutionize the series only to fail mount  blade ii bannerlord does quite the opposite and perfectly embodies the proverb mentioned above it religiously follows the blueprint for what constitutes a mount  blade game which is a great thing

for all intents and purposes bannerlord is basically just a remastered mount  blade warband just with a new expansion providing the new features and this was just exactly what the people wanted even bannerlord in very low graphics looks very close visually to warband that being said i will try to review it as its own game with only minimal comparison to warband

h1graphicsh1 
the graphics are decent it surprised me how a game that was at one point planned for a 2016 release still comes with visuals that is passable for todays 2020 standards props for the effort to upgrade the graphics throughout the years granted it isnt the best looking game ive seen still the game is an epic battle moment screenshot goldmine i wish they could include ansel support in the future 

h1combath1
there are lots of weapons in bannerlord bows crossbows spears maces axes swords shields of all types and many more there is also a weapon crafting system a new addition to the series besides traditional foot combat horseback combat is also available and a huge part of the game there are different theatres for warfare present throughout an open area of various terrains from dense forests rugged hills watery riverside to huge open fields or through the different villages or castles in the world map should you attack or defend them

combat is fun as expected for the series indeed one of the strongest points of the game swinging your weapon blocking and parrying attacks hitting and killing enemies all feels very gratifying the ai is harder now and thats a good thing compared to warbands buttery smooth combat and animations bannerlords take is much more gritty and realistic swings and animations have more weight to it weapons have far larger differences now in terms of speed and reach they react more realistically when hitting objects unfortunately this results in huge balance issues for the game that they need to sort out the game maxes out at 1000 units meaning you can have 500 vs 500 battles which is a huge amount of npcs fighting it really feels immersive going into battle and gives me that lord of the rings vibes cant wait to play lotr mods in the future

one major key feature that ive found missing is the autoblock option for at least the singleplayer this was actually the default option for the previous games so naturally a lot of old timers are requesting it back for now all players are stuck with the competitive style directional blocking this makes nonshield type melee combat inaccessible for a huge amount of players at the same time this makes shield or ranged combat the unquestionable superior types of combat

h1why early accessh1
in my opinion bannerlord really needs the early access treatment for better or for worse with the first game being one of the first titles to go on early access before it was even called early access having the second game follow a similar direction is just fitting 

for a game with such scope and ambition it is more effective to tap into the playerbase old and newcomers alike before going on full release thousands of players playtesting the game is much better than having an internal or limited access playtesting only sure they could have gone instead with a free beta access and offered a preorder option only for those willing to pay but its basically just early access in the grand scheme of things

h1it still needs a lot of work thoughh1
despite being in an already playable state the game still needs a lot of work especially in the singleplayer campaign questlines are unfinished and lacking in content textures missing and maps being reused some features are to follow or a work in progress should you play this game right now prepare to find a lot of placeholder text for basically everything warband actually feels more like a better and solid game right now when it comes to these aspects

h1technical performanceh1
the game ran passably on my setup i78700k 32gb ram and gtx 1080 hovers just around 5060 with everything maxed out and testing a 500 vs 500 npc battle its a cpu heavy game so no matter the resolution or graphics settings it still plateaus at around 5060 fps when the game gets very demanding as a high refresh rate user its a bit disappointing but this is one of the rare cases where i would trade my precious 100 fps for 50 fps just to experience huge epic battles ive only encountered one graphical bug so far during battle some parts of the screen bugged and turned into black squares i couldnt see 80 of whats happening i reloaded my save and so far it never came back 

h1conclusionh1
despite all the current issues its still a yes for me mount  blade ii bannerlord already has all the hallmarks of a future great openended sandbox game the foundation is already in place it just needs that extra time in early access to tie up all the loose ends 

if you want a fully polished solid experience at your first playthrough i would suggest waiting it out either by still buying it now at a discounted price to encourage and support the devs or by playing it safe by waiting for the final release before deciding to vote with your money

if youre deciding whether you should wait to buy the game or go for it now it all comes down to how much perfection you expect from a game in early access

all issues i have experienced are minor there have been no crashes or major gameplay issues all issues seem to be visual with the graphics not looking as good as the videos and promotional pictures but still overall pretty good minor other issues such as starting battles in first person and seeing the backs of your eyeseyebrows are the greatest problems ive encountered those are solved by switching from first to third then back to first person so its not the end of the world by any stretch of the imagination 

if minor graphical issues are a dealbreaker for you save your money until a few updates come out and maybe invest it in some chill pills in the meantime if youre okay with a game thats perfectly playable though a little rough around the edges you wont regret buying the game overall bannerlord is a massive improvement over the originals and im very happy with my purchase

bits finally harvesting seasonb

#####

1100 hours in annnd

the game is fun no doubt about it but for the most part its a prettier warband  without mods the game is pretty barebones in content  the game is not hard  once youve hit lvl 30 a few times you can steamroll the game  

if you are going to make you own kingdom in order to recruit other lords you will have to chase them down to give gifts or release them after battle to get your rep with them high to recruit them

if you have multiple towns the rep notifications from the governor with the merchants of the town is nonstop  each notification has a sound  in my current playthrough i get so many that they actually queue and lag behind

with the perk system some are useful  overall most are worthless  this is due to the fact that each perk has a role  like personal captain governor party leader  governor perks are worthless to player  players cant be governors  others are role specific surgeon scout engineer quartermaster

companions are essentially non developmental  scouts will increase their scout skill  surgeons just stop at 160ish  engineers wont go higher than 100ish  they learn other skills at an abysmal rate therefore they barely level  maybe 2 levels if youre lucky

sieges are plagued by the ai and player controlled soldiers not using ladders siege towers and engines in a reasonable fashion  if there are 2 ladders to one side to scale a wall only one will be used  some siege towers have 3 ladders  typically 1 is used normally but you might see 2 every so often  very rarely 3

now what i consider to be the absolute best part of the game  you will spend 90 of your time on the campaign map  moving around fight recruit siege defend etc  you will do this all at a whopping 612 frames per second  the menus load slowly  the last 3 to 4 patches have dramatically reduced the campaign map performance to a level that is 1 more headache away from never playing again  battles are just fine and have normal fps  taleworlds is indicating this might could possible be a bug and have no eta on a fix or if there will be a fix  with release happening this year

the very fundamental basics of a good game are there  taleworlds just hasnt done anything with them  they also havent appeared to want to do anything with them either  rumor is theyve moved on to another game or are working on dlc leaving this one to wallow in the depths of slow development

would i recommend this game  if you like mb and have the cash then have at it  if youre on the fence buy warband instead



#####

i didnt expect to play this game in my lifetime

#####

awesome but wish there was a multi player world campaign mode

#####

its finally here the harvesting season is upon us

im just gonna play it about 15 minutes before sleep


oh st its 6 am

my dad made me fall in love with this game lve always been into the crusades and the medieval period but when i finally played this i started tearing up because he is no longer here with me to play amazing medival games he was a huge mb fan 

me and my dad used to sit down for hours and hours and play pc games like mb and those are some of my best memories from childhood i remember we used to grind warband like crazy i still have all the expansions he bought it was some of the best times ive had with mb so i plan to make my own kids play it someday too

my dad was a big contributor for my love of video games just overall growing up gave me my first 3 systems the sega genesis ps1 and ps2 he might not longer be with me but i hope he knew before he left that some of the best times ive ever had was looking up to him and his level of skill in gaming i remember being 9 years old and him letting me try playing prince of persia 

i failed at it and him watching me fail he then proceeded to show me how to play
where to go to get a weapon how to fight when you receive that weapon it was interesting in a way he was showing me first lessons in life by letting me fail and then showing me how i should proceed to succeed i wish he was still around to play this one rest in peace dad the harvest is finally here

this game will make you forever forget the graphics arms race fps game clones and suck you into a realm of endless mods

its got a solid core but just like warband the basegame kinda lacks all my good memories from warband come from mods if were comparing strictly the base games though bannerlord is a prettier warband with a few more bells and whistles what will make or break bannerlord are the mods its one of those games that is a 7 or 810 without mods but is a fully satisfying 9 or 1010 with mods still even without mods theres fun to be had here

its got 150 hours of guaranteed hours of playtime unless youre bored with the idea of fighting in the arena to become the best champ there is

you can make babies that run your crap you can execute tyrannical people who work for the man you can simp for rhagaea or whatever her name is

you can uhh take on entire armies with a horse and a long ass sword

you can hang out at a bar you cant drink at yet

you can amass some amassive wealth in the trade world or become a taxing meanie yourself the possibilities are endless

all the mb games are very sandboxy like that im actually not a big fan of the heaviest sandbox games since they often leave me with the feeling of whats even the point of this game

imagine gta with no main missions for example where you just steal cars and drive around and do whatever as fun as that is for a couple of hours i think it will quickly grow tiring for most of us we need that driving goal with the game telling us what to do and reaching an end at some point

mb though is the exception for me it might be the only ultrasandboxy game i really love i think its partly because the combat never gets too boring and repetitive for me but you really just do whatever you want if you wanna raid villages you can do that if you wanna become a vassal for a kingdom and conquer all others do that if you wanna become a king of your own and make your own kingdom do that if you wanna become a merchant selling stuff for more than you buy with hide trade skill do that 

mb its a oneofakind game whatever game and one of the best whatever games out there what the hell are you waiting for

1010

#####

the game works but its still a bit shallow the previous games were just as good this one brings new graphics and a few ease of life improvements the big limiting factor of the previous games was the lack of unique interactions and this still feels very limited
most conversations have no purpose and often have nothing to say
i still like the game and i still play it but im not blind to its short comings

#####


the paradox of this game is that i waited so long for the final version that i finished school then college started a family and now i dont have time to play it when the children grow up the sea will play 



#####

its buggy it needs optimisation and it needs balancing but fuck me its one of the best things ive played in my life the devs have been addressing these issues and have released an update everyday for the past week itll keep getting better with the future plans and mechanics they hope to add ye love to see it

#####

i dont think that bannerlord is intrinsically a bad game im just disappointed with the direction that the development format seems to be headed

one of the most common forms of critical feedback is how the game is lacking features and endgame presence which were in warband and after grinding several saves out to the endgame i feel that those criticisms are 100 justified 

diplomacy isnt even worth discussing as a feature because it isnt one its a binary state of we murder each other now or we murder each other later relations do very little and make very little sense  i can execute someones entire family and as long as my relation is above a certain value with them they still love me 

the endgame encourages savescumming to ether override  evade war declarations and related proposals from major factions and your own clan members but this isnt a beallendall solution as the same declarations will still occur albeit 30 seconds later lending to a gameplay loop of besiege  quicksave  do meaningful action  quicksave  wait to start siege battle  have war declared on you by three major factions at the same time  quickload  repeat until the next instance of everyone declaring war on you simultaneously this is present in conjunction to the ai having zero preservation awareness if they have a military strength of 15k they will happily declare war on you even if you have 2530k strength their armies will chase small stacks that they will never hope to catch or attack a settlement across the continent leaving their own territory defenseless 

whilst those are just a couple of the pressing issues that mar the game past a certain stage of a save the earlygame is still enjoyable its a crying shame that once that point has been reached it is likely that you will have a better time starting a new character than dealing with the unoptimised grindfest that bannerlord offers as a lategame

meanwhile the developers release micropatches filled with 95 crash fixes and when meaningful content does get released its a poorlyimplemented feature such as the coordinated attack order or aesthetic additions such as more armour skins or battle maps with no campaignmap sense  heads up as to what kind of scenery youll be getting if you take a pitched battle outside of savescumming to enter the fight scout the terrain and either commit or nope out im on a bridge cool ill get a bridge map except there wont be a bridge in sight whilst the battle maps are a cool addition and i hope they continue to polish it it feels like is taking far too much of their time that they should be investing on building the base game out and adding much needed flesh to the bare bone that the current state of their product offers 

right now i cant recommend this game as anything other than a basis for modders as they continue to add  fix features that should have been in the game a long time ago and that the developers have had four years to implement yet seemingly refuse to do so 

to summarise please add flesh to your skeleton of a game before trying to dress it in fancy clothes

#####

its a good game but devs are really slow with the updates

my name is lucius varrus  my father was the village blacksmith at tevea  he and my mother were killed and my brother phasos and sister alea kidnapped by a roving band of raiders  my older brother nerva and five of our cousins armed ourselves and left tevea seeking justice

for six months we scoured the countryside of the northern empire killing bandit gangs  we lived off the loot we pillaged from their bloody bodies and fleainfested hideouts  nerva was the best warrior  he could put an arrow through the eye of a robin from a hill away practically ride his horse across water and splatter your head like a melon with his lance 

nerva embarrassed me by teasing me in front of the others  youre just as likely to hit one of us with an arrow or your blade  stay out of the way  dont try to help  ill handle it

he handled it alright  nerva caracco blacktooth cottula the healer and our growing clan of 20 infantrymen and archers slowly gained a reputation in lycaron and phycaon for killing bandits protecting merchant caravans and ambushing ambushers

this is not to say i am worthless  my skills are finding the high ground for our archers telling the infantry when to charge negotiating lucrative work for the clan and smithing 2handed weapons that fetch a good price  in that first year our purse was nearly empty  our men fought with wooden shields and wore leather armor  by spending our wealth on steel weapons roman shields and war horses our victories and numbers grew

eventually we tracked down king arion of the north and asked him to hire the varrus clan as mercenaries  he happily took us on  what a sweet deal  one hundred dinars for every southern empire head we took  we sharpened our skills butchering the militia in the southern villages looting their fish and grain making the lambda sigil feared across the south

then suddenly the saka declared war on the north  nothing frightens a warrior more than the sight of 30 yelping horse archers circling your formation  while we were raiding the village of karahan stealing their famed horses lord chaghan and 80 saka including 40 horse archers attacked us  there were only 50 of us 22 legionaries 20 auxiliary archers and 8 eques cavalry so we made a run for it  they  caught us out on the open steppe with no hills to fortify our position  

we squared up our shield wall put our archers in the center and dueled it out with their horse archers  our sturdy roman scutum shields made the difference  chaghans infantry wore padded armor and carried wicker shields  our legionaries chopped them up  nerva charged their horse archers skewering eight with his lance  

by the end of the day lord chagun was our prisoner and would fetch a hefty ransom  cottula the healer tended our wounded but we still lost 12 good northmen  of our 8 eques only nerva survived

after a year of war with the southern empire saka and western empire in an elaborate ceremony in the great city of onira king arion made me lucius varrus a vassal  the varrus clan were now legit  we were rubbing elbows with the famed junii tarpeii antonii and the numicii

on our own nerva and i took castle dinar from the saka then led the army that sieged the largest town in the northeast baltakhand  king arion could have kept the city for himself but he gave it to me  with it came the villages of fisnar ulaan and asalig where they produced sheep flax and steppe horses  

after five prosperous years the varrus clans influence dominated the northern empire  when king arion died with no sons it took me by surprise when the junii tarpeii and antonii declared me lucius varrus king of the north  me a poor blacksmiths son and the worst warrior in calradia now ruled an empire

under my leadership the northern clans conquered half of calradia  we captured rhagaea queen of the south and took all of her towns and villages  likewise we captured everything the saka held dear  we pushed the sturgians west and have taken half of the desert away from the aserai all the way to their fortress at qasira

in my capitol danustica with my queen phaea i somehow found the time to father five children four girls atia bellica messia and carfulena and my son hordeonius  we have made danustica the most prosperous city in the empire with aqueducts hanging gardens and great defensive siege engines  our people are loyal  theyve been untouched by war for four years  

i am 40 years old now  nerva is 43  my brother phasos and sister alea are 31 and 34 and lead their own war parties  phasos has become a good scout and alea a fair engineer  understanding how to use the trebuchet and onager to capture well defended cities is an art form and a joy like no other  it is good to be king

in this game i became the medieval military industrial complex

orestes was a simple man

after his village was raided by bandits he took it upon himself to form a small caravan he went from lageta to ortysia to sargot and back trading commodities such as horses wine grapes the like one day his humble caravan was beset by looters this battle awoke a bloodlust in orestes that he could not control

looking south orestes invaded the lands of the sand people and defeated a small army its general by chance the very sultan of the sand people was taken to orestes who had him decapitated there would be no quarter to the barbarian pagans of the deserts what ensued was an absolute bloodbath over 30 nobles slain in guerrilla warfare scorched earth tactics towns all over surrendered their meager #3 quantities of cheese and butter and also their hobbled weapons and tools 

the campaign would soon deplete orestes saved up fortune and he was forced to turn back to ortysia there he discovered his new passion as a salesman of the finest boots and headwraps but this was not enough curious one day orestes visited his local smith and forged his first sword in the span of a few weeks orestes would forge so many weapons as to rival hephaestus himself his swords soon sky rocketed in value and he was able to bankrupt the entire citys economy with the sale of a single one of his signature twohanded polearms titled mars

orestes would then take up arms again this time acquiring the dragon banner of calradia and claiming rightful fief of all of calradia barbarians would no longer sate his blood lust at the sight of the first castle garonter orestes would besiege with a force of 100 veterans against the castles 230 garrison it took him 3 weeks to build his siege engines and in 3 weeks he was beset daily by the empires best men even their emperor garios all would fall to orestes with the clairvoyant power of the f5 quicksave his kill count would rise each battle until night before the siege orestes himself killed over 100 men in single combat after the garrisoned had sallied forth from their gates 

it would be after this that orestes made peace with the empire went back to ortysia and crafted 30 divinely infused and crafted polearms each worth 40k and donated them to the towns under his fief within 3 weeks he was churning a profit that fuel his further expansion into thoracte castle tubulis castle sargot quyaz and now ortysia itself

now orestes raids the wastelands of the desert slaying man and woman alike his nations economy runs on him conquering the saracen heathens smelting down their impoverished weapons to craft ones divinely inspired by god himself then selling these majestic polearms and the fallen soliders boots back to his people who then sell those at even more inflated rates back to foreign nobles travelling through town

if it had multiplayer campaign it would be the best game ever

theres a lot to say that needs to be said if youre considering this game and have questions before you purchase  but if you dont feel like reading ill lay out the basics here this game is an easy 8 out of 10

now if youve made it this far this means you actually want to read so lets dive a bit deeper into what makes the game good but what takes away from the experience as well

the pros
the game may seem a bit steeply priced at 50 but i have found over 160 hours of gameplay that it is well worth the money its one of the few things i heavily criticize when playing a new game answering the whole do i get my moneys worth out of it question but with bannerlord i can happily say yes you will

the map is large the cultures have unique units and landscapes and the battlefield reflects upon that  no matter where on the world map you are or what you are doing the game reflects the location within the battle scenario  run into an enemy unit near a village  that village becomes the battlefield  rivers and bridges nearby  prepare to try to not get bottlenecked on a bridge  the siege mechanics are decent as well considering things like food stocks morale manpower siege engines etc all into play in a simple and clean structure that is enjoyable but not perfect

the game is laid out in a very create your own adventure kind of way which can be good and bad  the good is that your character is actually your character with your name your chosen looks and the game generates viable parents to help describe how your character obtained those looks and their background culture  i think its well done and certainly helps deliver a more personal connection to the character on the ground which helps me immerse myself and really get into the game

the cons

outright the game just does not feel finished  with the help of mods you can add a lot of features that you would have expected to be in the base game but in a game about warfare and kingdom building youd expect more diplomatic features cultural influence features rebellions civil wars within factions or even just things like treaties and alliances  only through the help of mods can you add these features to the game

voice acting now while the game is voice acted the character dialogue feels shallow and even the dialogue that isnt vad feels obscure and one size fits all  this mostly falls back on the lack of diplomatic actions within the game but i feel there are far more scream sound bites of soldiers in combat than there are those of lords actually saying things like sentences

the ai  its rather basic at times overly insane at others  following your fellow army of 1200 men towards an enemy unit of 2200  prepare to have them tuck tail and abandon you at the very last second and take on that enemy force alone   sieging an enemy city when an enemy army rolls up on the siege camp you and another army have formed  again prepare to have them magically evade the enemy leaving you to fight them alone   even within the battles themselves the ai can get silly  units spawning outside the map under the map or even just outside the city walls or in places that make it impossible to end a battle without having to retreat and go back into it  the ai pathing modeling and behavior all need a polishing but it seems the devs are pretty happy to leave the game in its current state so do with this information what you will


of course these are not all the pros and cons of bannerlord but instead the main ones the reason the list isnt huge and ongoing is because of one very important reason

modding

this game has a massive base of mods and modders constantly pumping out new and unique things for the game whether its new weapons new factions new behaviors ai fixes or entirely new ways to play the game built on the games assets the modding community is the glue that keeps me stuck to this title and playing away at it  anytime i get bored desire a new challenge or want a change of scenery all i have to do is go to the steam workshop or nexus and find the newest coolest or most interesting looking mods add them to my game and find myself willing to spend another 80 hours on a single campaign   

if youre in the market for a middle ages style game with interesting features like crafting your own weapons being a part of your own massive battles and building a kingdom from the ground up or helping another one conquer the world then this is the game for you

#####

game is really fun in early and midgame can recommend to anyone to try it out but

endgame is such a fucking horror i loved this game until i hit the mark of that point early and midgame is actually fun

i kill a 2k army take 15 prisoners kill another 2k army take another 13 prisoners put them all in my capitals dungeon i have all the perks that give prisoners less chance to flee in less than 3 minutes vlandia shows up with another 2k army i kill them and take another 16 prisoners by this time bunch of prisoners from the first battle already fled the dungeon slowly grinding down my units in less than 5 minutes i kill a 16k army again everyone is wounded in 2 minutes another 2k army shows up 

on top of that all my kingdoms overall strength seems to be 24k while vlandias strength is 7k but my retarded ai teammates all get wrecked somehow i finally siege and conquer all the settlements of vlandia after fighting battles for 10 hours straight then they have a 2k strength while i am around 20k they want 10k gold per turn to make peace what a bollocks of a game

not only that but my 2 other neighbours also declare war on me and i kill 2k armies every 2 minutes to see another 2k army coming in also if you dont have 500 troops in every fucking garrison there will be a smartass enemy that will always backdoor while you chase them there will be 10 more smartasses sieging your other settlements and hitandrunning your villages till the end of time

endgame of this game is cancer just quit after you make your kingdom and settle yourself after the first wars at that point the fun you will get out of the game is over start a new game

#####

even in early stage is great fun
i like to come and play it a few hours every month or so so i can see the progress
so in my opinion is like a better mount  blade  i just want them to keep adding stuff in it
we all know that the first was not perfect but still played it to death so more is better here
but please add more quality of life stuff we are in 2020 not 2002

#####

i like this game unlike real life i can have a wife and make lots of money

i really dont want to give this game a negative review but the things in the game force me to do so however for the thought that they are patching still this game and will eventually fix it i will not give a negative review firstly i want to talk about things that bother me


 castles in this game literally dont do anything and are useless they do not patrol around the villages attached to them whenever youre at war with factions the enemy lords raid your villages attached to your castle and your castle doesnt even care about defending your villages all they do is exist to do nothing and its really annoying like which one i will prioritize saving my villages from raids of my enemies or attacking enemy factions


 diplomacy doesnt exist in this game at all it doesnt depend on kingdom strength or anything it is completely rng the game wants you to establish a kingdom but how can you do that when everyone randomly declares war on you i had to play as a clan hopefully they dont declare war on you if you are a clan for a very long time until i was able to withstand against them however i failed the quest to create a kingdom due to time limit all because of this stupidity


when youre at war with a faction although you caused more casualties than them captured all their fiefs they dont give up always you have to propose peace and if you do you still have to pay tributes to them 

come on man like why


 although i like the battle system it lacks features for example when you fight an enemy they either create a shield wall and wait for you to attack or charge at you you can create a lot of formations such as circle skein square loose but they dont do that


 i still dont understand why theres a kingdom council in this game if i am gonna eventually say the last word even if everyone in the kingdom is against the a decision i can still enact it it would be nice if there were limitations for my ability to enact or veto anything


these are what this game lacks however i believe they will make this game better no matter what now lets talk about what it is fun to do


 combat system is great and fun theres decent amount of armor and weapon and theyre cool you can also download mods for more

 there are decent amount of quests although i wish there was more some of them are fun to complete 

 hideouts are also great and its my fav thing to do in the game even if im in the end game section its still fun to do

 games soundtrack is great fits the medieval times

 you can visit your fiefs and talk to people and clear gangs in your city or become a gangster also you can sit on the throne at your settlements

 theres arena section where you get cool rewards if you win its super fun arenas very useful in the beginning of the game btw

and more 



to sum it up buy it when its on sale despite the important features it lacks i believe they will be added and fixed eventually by the way through mods you can add the features i mentioned that this game lacks its fun and i think youll enjoy it 

for now id give 610 but will edit as the game gets better

this game has 1 incomparable strength and 1 flaw that almost breaks it

mount and blade games do 1 thing so well that everything else could fade in importance it is the talentbased realistic medieval combat on a battle scale not arcade slashing but actual combat which requires you to move and target in particular ways to be able to defeat an opponent and on horseback with couched lances horse archery once it was out there it made you wonder why no one had done this before it is the game i always imagined and waited for since when i was a little child in the early 1990s and there is still nothing else like it so despite many frustrations you will surely have if you are the kind of guy then mb is your game to go and you probably know it

the simple genius of the campaign design is the underrated part of the package you start the game as a lone warrior in 1st person you gather men to form a band and you can gradually grow this band into a royal army of thousands and form a state all in real time and with real numbers with no illusory scale jumps between layers of the game when you think about it this is an impressive way of gaming how medieval political entities actually came to existence as told by social historians like tilly elias bloch

in comparison to the mb1 warband the sieges are a major improvement and the graphics are beautiful

but i am here to write about 1 major frustration that almost does away with the games 1 major forte swinging twohanded axes on horseback is hilariously unrealistic and vastly overpowered to an extent that almost breaks the game in terms of both balance and immersion its not a thing that historically existed and its easy to understand why and it turns the game into arcade there are mods out there that tweak this but this is a fundamental game design flaw that shouldnt have been there 

one could go through a long list of other frustrations of course it is not clear why the mb2 bannerlord took so many years to launch and came out in still incomplete shape there are many essential features missing and you need to use mods to make up for them the nightday mechanic has no consequential effect camping and resting is almost entirely ignored and we still dont have seafaring which the mb viking conquest handled so well 

im inclining to vote down for these reasons but then i am turkish and i have to support the taleworlds efforts  at least while other games and studios go disproportionately for sugar graphics and boasting about the number of items they go for protein content gameplay and design but god why does it take so long and why the mounted 2handed axes

ive been sitting here for a little while trying to decide whether to recommend this game or not i know thats a strange predicament for someone with 265 hours on record at time of this review but let me explain

this game is great there is a lot to it and the files can be edited to make the game align more to your taste

however the ai is bad
and i mean bad
on campaign ive joined an army which gathered at a village which was very close to a friendly castle which was being besieged our army was larger than the besieging force but the army leader decided to ignore that and head north to almost the other side of the map to raid a village

in battle the army i was in advanced toward a battanian army which positioned itself quite cleverly at the top of a steep hill our army stopped and stood at the bottom just taking ranged attacks they finally walked half way up the hill but then turned around presented their backs to the ranged enemy and walked back down they did this about 4 times before finally charging up the hill the battle was won but there were so many avoidable casualties taken

in siege the ai doesnt understand ladders when they lift the siege ladders they only use one of the two if they use them at all sometimes they just stand at the base of the ladders and do nothing the ai is slightly better with siege towers though with laddered siege towers the defenders have a habit of climbing down the ladders and literally start fighting on them until one of the attacking artillery pieces destroys its own siege tower

these are just single experiences ive had from an absolute ton of them but i will still recommend this game there is still so much on offer and its early access so there is still time for these ai problems to be addressed

#####

this is half of a very good game you might be impressed in the first 10 hours but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game here is some of the good and some of the bad

the good
graphics look great even on lower settings
decently varied battle maps
sound design makes killing blows feel amazing
decent variety of weapons

the bad
extremely shallow campaign
almost zero role playing elements every character behaves identically towards you even your own wife will try to introduce herself kill someones fatherbrotherentire clan they will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else
realistic mode means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass
after you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious you will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive war changing battle oops looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days
almost zero variation of playstyles sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game

this is simply an unfinished game the fact they have been selling it for 50 successfully for years is wild
would have much rather paid 100 for a fully finished product

unless they have a massive overhaul on the official release october 25th i cannot recommend this game shame

#####

so i have a decent amount of hours 838 at the time of this review been playing this game on and off since the day beta came out

at this point in time everyone who played the original has already bought this game so this is for those who have never played warband

h1this game is the epitome of ignorance is bliss once you learn how to play it it is no longer fun h1

your first 1020 hours in this game will be amazing without any mods needed you will be running around with a little band of misfits trying to kill looters and bandits waiting for when you gather enough coin to actually take part in some serious conquest and siege some castles
you finally get enough coin under your belt to gather an army large enough to take part in wars and
this is when the game starts to fall apart if you could summarize bannerlord in one sentence
 h1as vast as an ocean as shallow as bird bath h1

this game starts out as an amazing sandbox but then you realize quickly the game was actually not designed for an end game scenario by the time you start having actual battles you have figured out how to cheese the economy and now there is no issue of money anymore and you easily smash every kingdom without trying and you are stuck in a perpetual loop of run around the map chasing down enemies to steam roll their armies time after time there is no reward or satisfaction in it by the time you start your the major battles the game is on easy mode no matter the difficulty if you dont want to destroy the entire world without trying you have to handicap yourself

h1there is no ai character interaction h1 
the world is lifeless the gameplay is souly this form a band of soldiers run around and smash everything this can be fun for a time but gets boring quickly
interactions with enemies are bland they added some voice lines but the issue is there are 3 possible outcomes to every encounter i will not explain them as it would ruin the appeal for first time players
interactions with every npc is even less limited you get a wife congrats all you can do is play a board game against her or wait in the town she is in and have children which serves absolutely no purpose thats it your entire option for interaction is a board game

 h1 mods do not increase the longevity of this game  h1 
mods are nearly nonexistent taleworlds has made it their main goal that instead of adding end game content or content in general they instead make every update break every mod and have made the modding community give up
you can go look at the workshop right now and see hundreds of mods just scroll to the comments every mods comment will be broken please update or does this work in 2xx
if you find two mods that look amazing chances are they only work on separate patches so you load version 17 for this mod but in order to play the other mod you need version 193 and the mods will not work together due to this issue
for example you want some muskets and napoleon gameplay style people made those mods because that sounds insanely fun just like napoleonic wars mod for warband the two mods that were created with muskets are both dead because the creators got tired of taleworlds breaking their mods every 2 weeks
and the largest issue is taleworlds is clearly expecting the modding community to make the content for them there has been no major changes since release its the exact same form your army smash everything repeat with no content since the beginning any time a mod tries to add quality of life taleworlds makes sure to bring an update to brake the mod 
and the updates do nothing for the game seriously an update will break every mod and talewords only changed the caravans income growth from 2 years to be profitable to 21 years the most asinine changes that no one cares about breaks every mod in the game

 h1 the multiplayer is stale and bland h1 welcome to the game of ping is everything you have ping higher than 10 congrats you will lose majority of your battles despite your skill with the combat system so choreographed it makes ping the deciding factor
for example with a proper swing and moving your character you can make a swing that takes 110th of a second to hit instead of the 14 second its supposed to so you have a ping of 40ms this means you have 60ms to to recognize the attack and its direction to block which is superhuman reaction time a ping of 100ms means anyone who knows how to fight will hit you before you can even have an opportunity to block
the multiplayer is dead and boring 

so again great game if you want to play it but once you learn the game it will be boring this game does not reward learning it the second you learn this game is the second it is no longer fun
if you like the concept of this game and do not care about graphics b get warband not bannerlord b its 20x better than bannerlord the world is more alive the mods are immense the character interactions with it are far more in depth and the end game context exists

the game would be amazing but talewords does not focus on endgame content and has a weird sadistic obsession with breaking any mod that comes out for the game

h1 so why do i recommend it despite hating the game h1
i loved the part in the game where i didnt understand what it was for the first 100 hours of the game it was amazing the next 700 hours has been chasing the dragon that doesnt exist 
all taleworlds would have to do is make end game content a thing make is so when you get big and strong companions you didnt recruit start to ambush you in cities and try to assassinate you that nations will form up together in coalitions to take you out or even just make some npc interactions i do not need voice overs i am completely fine reading a wall of text but make the end game world have some life in it

dear tw and readers of this rant

ive been one of the people straight up defending bannerlord 
after years of not delivering on promised systems delivering those in an insultingly crude manner with explanation along the lines of bwe want people who dont give a damn about such games to just buy ours so we simplify everythingb ignoring modders or even better yet having first hand comparison of how shallow and poor the vanilla systems are compared to simple mod features and stating that it doesnt fit our game design
after patches coming in with the most ridiculously unimportant no one asked and never will changes after seeing systems deteriorate into literal crap starting from 160 onward after hearing how our focus is to build the game to satisfy console players while ignoring the fact the only reason your damn studio ever made it with their first titles was only and i mean only a dedicated pc community

all i can say is im on the brink of extending my list of cancer game companies that turned from community supported to community hated to you as well and seeing how you respond to people who bmade your own games better while literally flooding you with an unimaginable amount of ignored feedbackb  i have zero remorse
shame on yall

8pm
just a couple more battles then i should go make dinner
blinks
it is now 2am

#####

its unfinished and it already makes warband completely obsolete

#####

the full game is launching soon and yet it feels as unfinished as the first early access release game breaking issues like troops not climbing ladders during sieges and instead pooling up at the bottom to be a fun target practice for the enemy enemy troops getting stuck inside walls preventing battles from ending simplistic ai that causes blobbing clumsy controls that prevents using tactics boiling down to f1 f3 bum rush or f6 and let the ai do it

remnants of unfinished systems are also laid bare for everyone to see there is one character in the main quest that has half of her lines voiced and seemingly no other  not even her counterpart character

other systems have been culled or severely cut back settlements no long have land plots for redevelopment build castles different types of farms mines or stables nor technology trees there is no way to adjust parameters such as tax rate militia size and work effort villages no longer have any development and castles and towns just have small incremental stat upgrades which replaces all these mechanics

criminal enterprises that allowed you to evict gangs and set up your own criminal enterprise have been cut almost entirely with on the vestigial and entirely unimportant gang member npcs that just offer repeatable quests  objectively some of the worst quests in the game and theyre entirely unimportant

there were hints to other potential mechanics like seasons which may or may not have had gameplay altering effects but are also seemingly absent or so toned down that i havent noticed them in the 100 hours ive put into the game

sometimes listening to the community is not in the best interests of the game but the developers seem to have taken this to the other extreme and completely ignore the community  beyond improving modding tools a happy accident of simply improving their own development tools they have no regard for the modding community that has kept warband alive for over a decade they have certainly not learned anything from the kinds of mods that have been produced for both warband and bannerlord the game design of mount and blade has not progressed from the first game in the series despite a wealth of examples of what could be done with the formula the developers seem afraid of even wading in the kids pool of innovation as demonstrated above cutting everything that even remotely approaches a new game mechanic

in summary bannerlord is fine and likely with time the community will develop content that will ultimately make bannerlord a good value proposition as a platform but ultimately as it stands there is so much missed potential and the game can be generously called a better looking warband but warband is the greater value proposition due to the wealth of mods that are already available for it and the fact that it is considerably cheaper

i dont hate the game but i am extremely disappointed that we had to wait 12 years for what amounts to a coat of paint and more bugs

this is by far one of the better games ive played even when this game lacks a compelling story unique npcs and is flooded with bugs i still enjoy this game more than titles of this genre i got married have like 3 kids my own kingdom an army of like 100 goons and own a couple villages i commanded armys to raid castles in bloody close combat battles and when i win i cant help but to feel like a badass just the title screen and music do it for me for that reason i overlook the flaws this game is jam packed with stuff but often feels repetitive the story isnt the greatest but the game litterally drops you in and you basically conquer the world the way you want be a warlord or a merchant side with person a or person b you have options high replay value i just wish the npcs had uniqueness really and the leveling gets slooow i dont usually write reviews but i hope this helps someone

#####

over the last couple of years this game has easily become one of my favorite games of all time and after 3000 hours of gameplay i felt it only fair to actually write a review in the form of pros and cons 

pros
 open worldcustomizationroleplayability   you can pretty much do whatever you want with this game want to play the main quest you can dont want to you dont have to want to be a scumbag who robs villagers you can do that do you want to own a bunch of breweries go for it mercenary work fighting in the army yes side jobs as an enforcer for a local gang leader sure traveling warrior looking to fight in every tournament to get famous why not lunatic out for vengeance and blood oh i hope so 
 diverse culturespersonality traitswarriors classes  you can be a mildmannered highland warrior wielding a great twohanded blade a bloodthirsty horse archer from the steppe with a snipers precision a grizzled saxonish knight clad in plate armor or a you get the idea there are a lot of options 
 combat  i love the combat in this game its visceral reactive and just a lot of fun 
 modding capabilities  the modding community has made this game even more fun want more weapons a more customizable economic system more cultures fantasy elements elves do you want the game to take place in the ancient roman empire instead of calradia or hell do you want to join the chaos that is game of thrones universe and just play the whole thing in westeros you can do all of that and more 
 replayability  again i have so many hours logged with this game and ive had about six or seven solid playthroughs 
 multiplayer  i can honestly say i have not played it myself but ive only heard great things from reliable sources

cons with suggestions
 voice acting  im not a huge fan i dont think its terrible but i kinda liked it better when the lords had no voice at all during discussions maybe add a function in the configuration menu to shut them up 
 certain characters lack in depth  it may not sound like such a huge deal but i would like to know more about all of lords and ladies of the realm we really only get information on a select few higher tier people but i want to know more about the others for example why is lord aeron mad bad and dangerous to know what did he do to earn this reputation i just think that there should be information on more characters even if its randomly generated at the start of a new game 
 there should be additional extended scenesevents  i always felt that events like marriage in a game like this would be an opportunity to add more politics and intrigue wedding feast events holidays and funeral events should have been created before full release also why dont old lords or kings ever ask about their grandchildren 
 childrens upbringingeducation  this should be far more customizable you should be able to add events to the childs life that truly shape them rather than just gifts lessons and tutors 
 lack of politicsreligion  the game has potential for so much more in the realm of politics religion and diplomacy i hope to see that in an update or even dlc someday i know there are mods that add certain things but i think they could do even better 
 graphics  it can be tricky to get the best settings for your system but there are guides out there 

simply put i love this game and i honestly think because of how much it checks all my boxes i just continue to expect more from it i do hope that even if the devs never get around to some of my suggestions i have not the ego to believe anyone cares what i want implemented maybe modders will continue to pleasantly surprise me

i made a javelin worth 160k gold but couldnt sell it because no one can afford it

bannerlord 810

edit features suggested by a lot of players including myself are being implemented into this game like diplomacy rebellions and much more huge respect to the devs for actually listening to the community its a good time to get it


past review
8 long years and this is what we get its not really a huge leap when compared to its predecessor in terms of graphical fidelity sure but veteran warband players will still experience more of the same thing and much of the dialogue is a copypaste from the previous title speaking of voice acting there is hardly any while the architecture is now more grand and detailed players will still have no reason to explore different parts of a city and fast travelling can be done via tab menu there are tons of things that are completely incoherent to the setting the villages as described by the game to be rich and flourishing are empty in fact it doesnt matter how prosperous it is you will still see the same farmers working the fields they should add more villagers each with their own things to say to make the environment believable castles have few guards without any noble residing in it in character customization you cant select presets you cant sculpt your characters face according to racefaction the quests from the previous title are petty chores and theyre imported into this game as well new merchant quests in particular are nonsensical and pointless 

im sure a lot of players would appreciate if the devs could create a more story driven campaign with voice acting in addition to its already solid sandbox foundation court advisors and viziers should be the intermediary during dialogue to show that a king isnt simply some peasant you can talk to an audience granted by a king or sultan must be sought earned and being in their presence should be an honour being knighted and swearing allegiance to them a prestigious moment to elevate a sense of purpose for the player even more so to imagine what it would be like for the player to be sitting on that very throne medieval nobility here are puppets to be exploited instead why not give them their own unique personalities with their actions and yours affecting political climate and change of attitude among them npcs are just programmed to war with each other with no proper implementation of diplomacy if the player eventually rules a faction why cant the ruler send an emissary to a neighboring kingdom to open up favorable diplomatic options why would there be a feature to dress casually if it didnt affect your status or charm there should be different and interesting dialogue options when speaking to npcs female players should be able to curtsy and dance in accordance to the factions culture whats a medieval age without upheavals there should be demagogue usurpers from a starving populace hellbent on overthrowing a crazy monarch these are examples of how you add depth to a sandbox game 

despite all this i can still recommend it to players who have never played mount and blade this is simply an upgraded version of the previous title with a simple economic system political system based on influence tournaments and the new blacksmithing feature the battles are still epic as ever with a plethora of medieval weapons armor accessories and horses for yourself and your companions as for me im going to wait for for the devs to actually make use of the financial support theyre getting and release a major update worth playing

#####

this is an excellent game but it is hampered by poor update speed

#####

this is everything i had hoped for in this game even in ea is it 100 finished of course not but certainly 8590 some things need to be fully added some things just arent functional 

the reputation system is not perfect yet as its very hard to gain rep with others but very easy to lose it but the economy is super fleshed out i started as a merchant to get myself going and could easily see how my efforts were effecting cities i traded in their prosperity and thus mine as eventually i owned workshops and saw them flourish as i made sure they had the necessary items to produce goods 

as far as performance goes i dont really have much to complain about it runs fine on my machine and only supermassive battles do i see frame drops in the start sometimes it does crash but im used to frequently hitting that f5 button quicksave so even if i do its only a few minutes lost 

i have sort of seen the snowball people talk about but in my experience each time it happens the faction eventually crumbles there are a lot of npcs and they certainly flock to strong factions i think it will be more manageable in my subsequent playthrough now that i know a lot more 

all in all this is shaping up to be just as legendary as the original i didnt expect a perfect game from the start but am still impressed about what is in the game and functioning now there are many things that are clearly placeholders and things you can see have a presence but not fully functional that is fine with me 

it is now friday  the game came out monday so in 4 days i have 75 hours played and i am not a fanboy by any means and wouldnt blindly praise something just because in fact the original game i played more of the got mod than the regular game but for 40 i have already surpassed my criteria 1 per hour of getting a good game with value i am sure i will have a decent amount more as i finish up my campaign and maybe another soon but i also know that when the game is fully released i will double my time again to experience the full force

#####

quarantine just got good

#####

bro we just want coop please what are you doing
good game tho

#####

awesome game but would be better if we could play coop

#####

still waiting on a coop gamemode instead of this pvp only bs

#####

soup just aint done yet but hell it is soup

#####

its bigger better beautiful and oh yes in early acces
even with the devs working on it constantly its amazing to play
ive had my share of crashes and then a new beta came out and fixed
the game isnt perfect yet but it will be
theres so much good in this game and the devs will support all the modders to make their amazing stuff too

honestly these devs deserve your support the game is already great fun to play 
if you loved mount  blade warband then get this now youll be mind blown
if you dont know about mbw but you love making your own path in a sandbox world full of danger and excitement well then fellow traveller i could use someone like you in my army 

#####

i like imagining im rich and i control the world in this game because in real life im a nobody this game will help you feel productive in this amazing simulation game makes me feel important in a sense of literal hundreds of imaginary people depends on you 1010

#####

i really enjoy playing bannerlord as i did playing warband
if you liked warband as of now think of it as a warband 20 give it some time and hope and with updates and mods we will get a real bannerlord but you can get it now its good
in short  many good ideas cool gameplays mechanics but a lot of grind unfair bots and if you want to winnot loose you have to play their way lacks replayability if youre not into this genre and many things are missing or to be improved but its good and i like it

things i like 
 being able to make your own kingdom and rolling over the kingdom of the ones that you owe 8k tributeday
 the possibility to save try out things and correct my mistakes yes i like that possibility no iron man for me
 some mods are great and now steam workshops integrated i love diplomacy
 the massive battles although i dont use the mod to put even more troops as its not stable for me and sometimes the enemy gets backup way earlier and more often than i do
 when you have good relation with people they talk you like equals and i dont know i like that
 the massive parties you can have with many troops i mean
 sometimes sieges are really satisfying on both sides but defenders are often way to advantaged defending a castle i won a 200v1k battle in autoresolve and attacking i lost a 300v50
 the fact that you can outsmart your ennemies and win battles when you are outnumbered up to a certain ratio

things i dislike 
 not many options for your kingdom you have general policies but not that deep of a way to customize your kingdom
 vassals are a pain to recruit you can hardly recruit lords even when you are way stronger than another realm you have to search for the rare ones that will agree on fighting by your side and why does your clan have 7 parties with 100 troops when you are working for the bots and 2 clans with 49 recruits when you are working for me 
 interpersonal relations are super basic likes you dislikes you and sometimes weird i befriended unqid the aserai sultan as my brother married his daughter way later he declares war on my kingdom and when i engage parleys he tells me that i betrayed him me no likey
 some skills are too long to level up and some are not interesting

things i have mixed feelings for 
 garrison systems and the mod improved garrison im not satisfied with either
 no female apart from the nobility companions and a pair of mercenaries the sisterhood theres a mod for that but given that calradia is always at war i think female troops could be a logical implement the game is a bit unfair when the player plays a female character maybe there could even be patriarcal or matriarcal policies
 yes my characters sisters and daughters can be married no i dont want them to leave my clan and be used to join armies to fight against me and also  if my character or his brother marries your daugther we could maybe have good relations 
 i like the idea of a campaign but i feel like its going against me if i dont do that specific thing everyone will ally and beat the it out of me
 initially you will fight every battle but progressively you will tend to autoresolve almost 90 of them as they are either repetitive and too easy or hard because the ingame battles dont allow you to take many troops and the fights get almost 11 when the troop number difference is not huge i have mixed feelings for that because in a way i like small battles so i still do some and autoresolve are faster but battles are a great mechanic in bannerlord so id like to play them more if the systems were better and sometimes autoresolves results in a better outcome for you with less losses  
 smithing too op to make money if you fully focus on it but if you dont you will have to wait almost the endgame to make really cool looking and op weapons which is the real fun of it

things id like to see improved or added 

 deeper relation system family truely befriending nobles and companions 
 better vassal dynamics
 better or more important global economy between villages and cities and maybe between cities
 better war dynamics eg  raiding villages plays an important role in winning a war bots always do it but try doing it once and everyone will hate you forever eg  i captured 17 of your nobles out of 25 maybe you could admit i won instead of waiting a month for them to escape while hanging onto your castles
 better inventory management
 better troop management
 improved strategic choices when you delegate command troops can for example split cavalry to protect your flanks you cant really do that also when youre part of an army the commander can order you to act a certain way or order a given strategic line like playing on defense or getting just close enough for your archers to shoot the problem is  you cant really do everything by yourself and if you delegate command your generals will rarely do what you intended
 there are no dogs or cats  im the ruler of an important clan i want my dog with me
 why cant we make camp with our party  i really liked that feature
 send your companions and other parties on custom tasks take my prisoners and sellemprison them go defend that castle at the border dont wander around the safe zone of the kingdom recruit more archerscavalryinfantry execute these automatically but not these spy on them sabotage this towns doors or garrison try convincing this one to like me or to hate his ruler
 workshops in cities need to be improved drastically they have no significant use as of now apart from telling yourself oh cool ive got a brewery a blacksmith and a tannery they give me 60 denars each day what a greatly invested early 15k19k hardly gained denars
 at one point trading is loosing its interesting part as many things in this game it seems you end up selling everything without thinking and cities dont care what mylord  you want to sell us for 99k of worn leather boots curved arrows decayed flax and rusty falchions  no problem even if we are now ruined
 maybe playing games in taverns and lords hall would be better if it had an impact on the relations  it could create another gameplay loop instead of playing them once and never going back because the ia is too strong for my small brain and i get no reward for winning
 tournaments they are really good but somethings missing the variety of the fights also maybe the possibility to fight and win the tournament as a group the weapons and rewards i dont know you like them at first but then they lose interest pretty fast
 smithing make it less grindy less profitable and let us craft cool weapons yeah or maybe the possibility to hire a smith
 back to the last idea  maybe hiring specialists could be nice and complementary to workshops this ones a smith he crafts better weapons for you and your army this ones a horsemaker english is not my first language he can give you highqualitywork horses this ones an assassin he assassins or poisons or sabotages i dont know leave me alone this ones a spy he gives you insights on the relations and politics of other kingdoms with useful informations this theater group can improve the mood of a city for x days for y denars 


hope this will be enough
id love to make mods to improve the things on the list i made but i have no skill nor time to make them maybe one day who knows
tw keep on updating the game and adding content we count on you

#####

wish it had a coop campaign so you could create a factionkingdom with a bud great game

#####

my wife keeps having babies were on our 6th one now the only problem is that its been when im not around pshhh im sure its just a bug

#####

this game is still in early access after all this time  and its still getting large updates  and it still has some wonky design decisions  but its entertaining and addictive if you like the genre and easily worth the asking price in its current state

first accept that the game cycle is repetitive  youll visit towns to pick up troops and quests  youll attack roving bands or static locations to level troops or complete quests or get loot  youll return to towns to do smithing heal or get new troops and quests  youll read or skip dialogue choices because you know what is at the end of them  i thought that so much repetition would be a dealbreaker for me but it isnt

first off the game presents a difficulty curve with at least three distinct phases that each have unique challenges
 at the start you do a lot of running away from fights and getting captured recruiting randomly and fearing youll run out of money  exiting this stage requires you to learn how to personally fight trade or pick better battles for loot that justifies troop losses
 in the mercenary phase your success leading a small band becomes stressed by a new need to be wary of diplomatic entanglements of your faction  in this phase and the next you gain a new appreciation for the interplay between speed and force
 in the vassalindependent phase the mechanics of armies sieges partyreinforcement food and influence take a new meaning  now speed force and cost  along with the burden of caring for fiefs is all equally important
 in the king phase if you choose to attempt it you suddenly thrust yourself into the crosshairs of every sovereign nation and the combined force of all their vassals

will successful players learn tricks to make these challenges seem easy  sure  and you can go looking for guides online if you dont like the satisfaction of learning for yourself  but if you do like learning this game is a nice puzzle to unlock dozens or hundreds of hours spent unraveling what makes the game tick

against this backdrop of player growth 
 there is a welldeveloped personal skill tree with progression tied to a combination of points spending and actual activities of the player
 there is a trait and relationship system which just might cause you to think twice about the person you marry or the quests you accept
 there are 6 different nations with enough variation to justify divergent play choices and starting builds even before considering flavor alone as a motivating force
each weapon not only has tier and damage but speeds associated with different kinds of attacks and defense lengths weights and effective sectors of engagement  your equipment horse and fight style preferences are personal rather than dictated strictly by leveling up
 the option to roleplay all the way down to a walking simulator or ignore the tedium and interact purely through menu interactions is a nice touch
unit choices party and army compositions command choices unit formations countercompositions and counterplay timing and opportunity recognition are all more relevant in this game than simpler get big win type titles
the game world is alive with factions and parties following the rules and trying to get ahead by doing it  they may not be as effective as the player but the map borders will move allegiances will shift and prices will fluctuate following supply and demand even without player intervention  compared to a stale experience like x4 this was a welcome feeling of immersion

concerns
if you dont intentionally go into settings and consider performance and graphics choices you may be disappointed with stutter or unacceptable cpu loads  for example the default fps limiter is set to 200 which causes my decent system to spike resources to fulfill 200 constantly  reducing it to 60 gives the same experience for a third the resource cost  ironically this complaint is also a sidenod to how ambitious the game tries to be in allowing 4001000 individual models to interact with each other with terrain to ragdoll and subject each other to attacks that are hitlocation dependent in interesting 3d environments

the game is technically multiplayer but not in any meaningful way  i strongly prefer multiplayer games for longterm fun  still the singleplayer campaign and sandbox has offered relaxed enjoyment for too many hours to complain about

in case i didnt mention it the basic play cycle is actually pretty repetitive  ask yourself if you enjoy similar partymercenarytraderfree agent games like port royale or star sector  if the answer is yes you probably dont mind this kind of repetition

you will be tempted to restart a lot as you learn things  what is interesting about this point is that its hard to actually lose but easy to feel like you should have done better  i have played from the beginning on ironman at hardest difficulties and still i have known every time i restarted that my game wasnt over  each time i was starting over because i learned something important and wanted to improve  even if i got bored with this game in the near future its hard to claim that 200 hours is anything less than a full price value

#####

most of the negative reviews for this game are people who bought it early on and saw how little this game progressed through the passing of months positive ones are the ones with few hours because i indeed agree it feels like a new game completely which is good as there was already plenty of content for warband through great mods

however what surprises me the most is that they say this game will be released june next year sourcing themselves httpsstoresteampoweredcomnewsapp261550view4509778749610642532  how come game is far from finished and absolute snails pace of development will for granted not finish it in a few months when this game has been going on for years and since they launched it on steam on early access prepurchase they have mostly been doing minor fixes and balancing no new features quests or dialogues since i last played to this day

game is enjoyable early on i like that theres a main quest that adds special events to the gameplay unlike in warband but theres only one and its pretty straight forward on every new game you do combat feels good but besides that talking to a lord is always pointless unless he has a task for you no options whatsoever sieges get like in warband to be repetitive but here theres bugs that make sieges way more difficult than it should be fief options are very limited marrying has little use besides getting a free companion selecting a bride for your brother is literally useless

this game as of december 2021 feels okeish but still a shell unfinished product and if you watch the pace at which theyve been adding patches and specially at the scarce amount of contents within these patches you already know this game will not be finished for june 2022 at least i hope they allow mods to fix all the stuff that was meant to be fixed already when game releases but it still feels wrong for a 50 game which has been 2 years in early access and many more on development

#####

after 600 hours of archery im more of an axes guy well another 600 hours to go

#####

i would first recommend this game to the players who are more open world  medieval combat oriented games like mordhau kingdom come deliverance chivalry etc are the reasons i fall into this category and if you like any of those games or any similar to that you will already like bannerlord before you realize it but to those who arent familiar with mb a half decent summary would say it is a medieval sandbox where your goal is to be the strongest faction on the map by whatever means necessary  
 
to those who played mb warband
many would consider this to be a continuation of this game and id have to agree it is not a bad thing because i believe there is a lot more content being added and a lot of problems that have been solved since then combat mechanics are the same with some ai differences and new weaponsarmor new perk treesconcepts for you and your companions bannerlord also added a questline that nudges you along towards total domination either by you or your ruler oh and also when you feel like skipping the battle and just sending your troops in they fixed the chance system for how likely characters are to die so rest assured you dont have to worry about one sea raider killing multiple of your hundreds of troops

 

what i found to be the strongest points that make this game shine
a free roam concept where you do as you please you can servefight for whatever faction you wish including your own you can interact with characters courtattacktrade and so on

you are able to participate in open battles with hundreds of units on the field commanding different types of troops to do different actionsface a certain direction make a formation hold fire follow you and many others or if youre a part of an army filled with other nobles then you lead one type of troop infantry arrows cavalry horse archers under your commander regardless you are going to take a step back when you first see dozens of cavalry rolling over the hills in the distance or when your commander gives the order to charge and you have to join the front line where chaos is the only thing that is happening 

siege events with a lot of potential for strategy i say potential because if you decide not to set them on auto the troops are only as effective as you are at commanding them but as far as content there is a lot going on between manning a catapult to try and take out their siege tower and making sure that the troops are holding the line at the main gate where theyve broken through it takes a lot out of your hands as you try to make it all happen on the keyboard and it looks really intimidating seeing hundreds moving troops outside your walls 

very smooth trading system in markets and with npcs its still in ea so frame rate drops load screens still happen but that is something that will be smoothed out 

music music music i love the music consistently mb proves that not all gaming companies are giving up on going above and beyond for their soundtracks the only negatives i have for this one is that there isnt enough of it and i wasnt there in person to hear it being performed 



sadly i found some things to be negative points about the game this is kind of difficult to tell since it is in ea so things may be addedchangedfixed after this post so i will focus on content that is there now rather than bugs and whatnot 

ai isnt the smartest if youre not the commander and you are only in charge of one troop then they go on to do whatever they want to and it may not match up with what is considered the best strategy at the beginning of each battle you spawn on opposite sides of the map one battle my commander thought it best to go backwards and to the left up a hill with a bunch of trees pushing the boundary of the map i had to figure out where i was going to put 200 archers so that they could see and fire at the enemy 

you only know as much as you research what i mean by this is that the only tutorial you get is the combat and how to use different weaponsshields arguably this isnt a negative but i deem it more negative than not because there are a few menukeyboard tips that would help to know early on as silly as it sounds i spent more time than i should have looking in the vendors inventory for food because i didnt know that the category filters were at the top of the screen or how i wanted to look characterslocations up to know what faction they were a part of or to find them but couldnt until i accidentally pressed n and opened the encyclopedia they have already added a mechanic that lets you click rmb to open the encyclopedia on a certain items but that doesnt solve the entire issue of the average player being clueless right now when you press esc in game there is a list of tips you can look through on the left which is a plus but i hope they add more because it doesnt solve as many questions as it could 




all in all the game is great and any of the negatives ive found dont outweigh the positives if you were sold on the game after a few points then youre going to love it regardless of whatever you dislike about the game i bought it not only because it appeals to what i like in a game but also because i believe taleworlds is capable of reminding players what their standards should be for a great game anyways i hope this helps

i have never clicked on a game and paid 40 faster in my entire life

1010 would do it again

#####

i bought this game when it came out for early access because i was a huge fan of mount and blade warband i had a lot of faith in the dev team i played the game back then and felt satisfied with what i saw along with the assurance that they still had quite a long road of development to go i genuinely believe that the only marked improvement they have made was fixing the siege battles which were previously completely broken and unplayable this game feels good early on maybe the first 1020 hours of play into your campaign however once you create your own kingdom or fight for another kingdom everything just falls apart nothing about medieval warfare translates to the way things work in this game castles mean nothing cities mean nothing you dont even earn much money from owning any fiefs at all further castles do not serve literally any purpose because any army requires a companion or lord to field them take them out of the garrison your castles cannot send the garrison out to respond to petty lords raiding your villages your castles cannot send an army out to aid you in fighting an nearby enemy army you will get to a point in which you own 10 fiefs cities castles settlements and all the villages that are spread across a distance of approx 3 days travel will constantly be raided by enemy armies not even significant armies these armies will vary from 2050 troops they arent even worth your time to fight at this stage in the game but if you dont return to your village they fuck them up you might think whatever ill just take one of their cities with my 1000 strong army and they will be forced to respond to my threat nope they do not give a fuck they will continue to raid your villages crashing the villages prosperity and security into the ground in turn your cities that preside over these villages will have their prosperity and security crash remember that tiny income you get from owning all those fiefs when things are running okay well now you are paying up money every single day because these ratfucks are constantly raiding your villages you might be thinking to yourself right about now why dont you just chase down all these lords and defeat them surely there is a finite number of lords that can raid your villages perfect opportunity to talk about how completely and utterly pointless fighting battles are literally they serve no purpose its just a game of whackamole defeat an enemy kingdoms army of 1000 who gives a fuck those lords you dont manage to capture will fuck off and hire on some more peasantssoldiers to continue to raid your villages the lords you do manage to capture will inevitably escape your prisons and fuck off to hire on more soldiers to raid your villages i thought thered be a conceivable end to this hellscape after i took the last of an enemy kingdoms cities they literally have nothing they have no cities nothing and yet there are tens of lords from this faction rampaging through the countryside and raiding my settlements seriously fuck this game taleworlds should be ashamed of this giant pile of steaming dogshit they served up i would not be so vehemently aggressive in my negative review if they did not officially release this game i have not even touched on a lot of other problems either diplomacy personal relationships kingdom ruling trading blacksmithing etc are all bad nothing in this game feels real i could talk about each of these issues at length but this review is already long enough shame on you taleworlds really turned a longtime fan into a hater

#####

i think most of the negative reviews of the game are correct the games lacks something that warband has soul 

bannerlord can feel empty sometimes even when it has so much more stuff than warband there are so many characters lords merchants gang leaders mercenaries that its hard to make a connection with them hell characters are born as the game progresses and some names are repeated is that realistic yes you probably know more than one john steve or whatever but it can be confusing for the player and it makes it difficult to connect to other characters

in warband there is only one lord haringoth for example and you can roleplay being his friend or mortal enemy you see his name on the battlefield or even in the event log and you can feel something about it 
in bannerlord you will not care about the event log because most of the names that appear there are irrelevant for you even if the names of characters you know appear there it goes so fast with so many names and things happening and to make it worse you cant open a event log menu like in warband if you enter another menu the log in the campaign screen just clears itself losing all the log 

thats only one thing that one can consider bad about the game there are many more that you will notice if you look closely or if you play the game long enough things that bannerlord just does different than warband and others just bad things plain and simple 

the game has a workshop and you can download ton of mods but my two cents about it 

1 when the game updates it breaks many mods you can roll back to the previous update but its still a pain in the ass if you dont like to manually do stuff 

2 although mods are a good thing the devs should fix the vanilla game problems and keep adding stuff the destiny of the game should not be put on the shoulders of the modding community 


why the possitive review because it still is a good game it is fun it is engaging it is a game you will spend more than 100 hours and for me thats worth the money the problem is that many of us come from warband and we cannot not compare them and thats when you can find stuff you may not like

im playing the singleplayer campaign full vanilla not one single mod and im having fun i put aside my previous expectations for the game and take it for what it is i have more than 900 hours in warband in steam and so much more in my jack sparrow days so i know the pain many people feel and i know that the game could be so much more and it just didnt live up to the expectations we all had but the game is still worth it it will keep getting updates and many more mods will appear 

if you take bannerlord for what it is you will play the game more hours than what you payed for 



#####

as an adult gamer with parental responsibilities this game is a perfect way to conquer the pretend world while being able to pause as real world raises its demands for things such as grilled cheese sandwiches i purchased this game when it released in march 2020 but only really got to playing it as of september 2021 #firstworldadultgamerproblems so the current version im playing vs the original release that i dabbled in for a few hours show a lot of incredible and quality updates i havent even bothered with mods as the vanilla game has kept me entertained for over 150 hours at the time of writing this

#####

as someone who followed this project very closely on the official forums i have to say that taleworlds is an absolute garbage at their job they are sidelining the community at every opportunity they have a track record of hindering any and all attempts of their modding community at fixing their broken game and have shown actual jealousy over the work of their modding scene
almost two years ago tw proclaimed that custom moddable servers cant be made now but theyll be a thing in 2022 which prompted the modding community to making their own custom servers in few days of work all by adding few lines of code tw of course threw a hissy fit over it and patched it out but it at least shown us how incompetent they are at their own jobs
its early access you have to lower your expectations  my expectations are so low that i had to dig a hole for them to lay in
this game should have never been released in early access you need tons of mods to make it actually feel alive and fun something which tw is actively hindering by throwing tantrums at all total conversion modders because once again  players can do a better job than the actual devs
this whole development process is a farce from start to finish i honestly hope that when they maybe eventually release their 16 theyll adress all these issues and stop sidelining players with corpotalk and tantrums but its taleworlds so the reality is that theyre probably limiting our possibilities to milk us on future ingametransactions and mediocre dlcs
i wish we got the same treatment warband did with viking conquest which was a joined project of both the developers and the community

forums topics im referring to in the review are an open letter from the kingdoms of arda team and the totalconversion mod community and multiplayer mods cant be made until 2022 unless we find an alternative but there are literal hundreds other posts and topics there that show how out of touch and jaded the devs are i will be posting links to the topics mentioned above below assuming steam wont delete them

i love the game and played it plenty but as it stands it is a combatconquest sandbox with little other interaction  the in game diplomacy can be generously described as bare bones and interpersonal interactions are more or less not present  companions gain exp at a near glacial rate for most skills excluding the slots reserved for specific party role scout quartermaster medic and engineer  while i like the weapon forging system and it can be fun to make weapons you like it is rather hilariously broken as once you figure it out you can regularly make weapons that sell for upwards of 40k or more  destroying the economy  the ai during war times can be rather frustrating having large armies of 600900 men chasing around a 30 man group they have no chance of ever catching while the enemy could be sieging one of their cities not but a half days march away  in conclusion the game feels like the core of something that could be great but is simply missing individual mechanics to make wandering its world feel worthwhile  i love the game and wish it were more and i hope someday taleworlds fills the game out to the point of making this review entirely wrong but after 2 years of development with little movement frankly at all i cannot in good faith recommend the game

update nov 2022  game has improved with various updates including mechanics gameplay performance etc  ill elaborate on these when i can at a later time  if youve been on the fence about bannerlord id say  get it now  

tldr
for any fan of the mount  blade series bannerlord is an easy choice  yes get it  its worth the price even in early access  ive played bannerlord from day one and can honestly say the current game has drastically improved since the public release

essentially the player starts as a skillless worthless unknown peasant and begins earning hisher salt by fighting up through the ranks  exactly what you do is your choice  become the righthand man of a kingqueen or develop your own kingdom  stay independent and deal in trade as a merchant  rogue it up by ransacking villages traveling civilians and caravans  be honorable or a miscreant  theres no linear path but choices have consequences good and bad
the start can be rough and a bit of a grind but once youve saved enough money to hire some troops purchased a few shops hired some caravans and made some noble friends then the game really takes off

key highlights

pros
 open world sandbox
 combat is mostly fluid and satisfying  certainly not a combat simulator but requires just enough skill to be more than a simple buttonsmasher
 first person perspective combat and 3rd person for you weirdos out there p 
 no specified roles  fight on foot or horse  fight with sword ax polearm bow  arrow etc  heavy armor light armor or no armor  shield or no shield  that is the question
 progression  there is a noticeable difference in combat as your character improves as well as your companions npcs whom follow the player
 skill tree  a wide variety of skills that definitely impact game play  
 inventory management big improvement over previous titles 
 family system  can marry and have children  children become heirs so the player can continue playing once the original character dies from old age
 companions  various npcs have unique skills  use them to your advantage warrior trader engineer surgeon and more
 town  castle management  can build improvements to fiefs that impact security garrison income growth and a few others  pretty basic  improved over previous titles but needs love  see neutral for more info 
 gangs  every town has a gang that may or may not own a shop  can clear them out of towns temporarily to gain favor of from merchants or other gang leaders  impacts your reputation and relationships  i believe future updates will incorporate more uses for them
 shops  can purchase shops in town as an easy way to earn extra money  read a guide on how they work  not much to them but some things arent apparent
 graphics are nice  nothing nextgen but still eye pleasing
 developers  they continuously add updates and meaningful changes  yes there have been a few broken patches but it doesnt take long before theyre corrected
 hundreds and hundreds of hours of game play  im not even sure if there is an end unless the character dies with no heirs

neutral
 storyline  its just meh  regardless it has been improved and expanded
 equipment weapons armor etc  there is already an impressive amount of gear but i do hope they add more especially for armors and cosmetics civilian clothing
 towncastle management  simply needs more depth and complexity  a bit too basic as is but not enough to warrant a con

cons
 hit registry  usually good but will definitely experience instances when the players weapon passes through enemy with no damage  
 ai  friendly ai love to block your attack your path and overall be a nuisance  common to have nearby friendlies block your attack on enemy while enemy ai happily ignore the shields of friendly ai  its just aggravating and weird
 ai pathing  has been improved but still an issue  ai dont always climb ladders or siege towers but rather stand at the bottom while arrows rain down from above  perhaps they drank too much mead before battle  helpful tip  sometimes the problem is one moron blocking the ladder  an arrow to this guys face may unscrew the screw up
 lighting  some objects like plantsbushes and rocks bleed light casts a glow around or under them  some flickering issues in certain areas  when characters or horses run they kick up large clouds of dust and its very reflective  all minor issues
 pc requirements  youll want a fairly beefy system to enjoy large battles and high graphics but a midrange setup and lowered settings can play adequately  my settings  pc setup  end

areas to improve
 hit registry needs love  its not horrible but can be very aggravating at times during critical moments
 barter screen  the slider scale is too sensitive when trying to adjust large amounts of items or currency  also the mouse delay for holding leftclick is way too long before items increase or decrease
 some areas in towns or battles have light flickering or light bleed under rocksplants during certain times of day

playing at 2560x1440 on mostly high settings averaging 100120 frames during battles

a worthy successor to warband but it still needs more time in the oven mods fix some of the bigger issues id rank it as a mustplay if you were a wb fan or if youve ever wanted to play a total war game as a 3rd person rpg of sorts

pros
 looks good many times even better than the screenshots on the steam store
 moddable
 gorgeous soundtrack
 the core gameplay loop is awesome it feels good to go from zero to hero you eventually find a favorite weapon that suits your play style and smithing can let you obtain an even better version of it
 battles no longer end when you die and you can fastforward the remainder of the battle which is very nice
 a lot of the crashes that made the game almost unplayable near release have been fixed in 162 i got about one crash every 34 hours and thats while running 10 mods which is pretty good in my book  just save often

cons
 the first and biggest issue is the way experience works because new levels ask for exponential increases in skill levels while decreasing your learning rate reaching mastery in any skill takes an incredible amount of time i get that realistically you could only hope to master one maybe two things during a lifetime and the game wants to lean towards realism i just wish the game also offered you the choice between realistic and power fantasy when it comes to skill leveling because the game is a lot more fun when you can personally take out 3050 enemies before formation combat even begins

as of 162 you can address this by using the leveling rebalance mod possibly in combination with the kaoses tweaks mod unfortunately mods frequently break during new updates so this will be a recurring issue

 endgame kingdom management should have some autoresolve options such as give fief to noble with most council support  highest relation  lowest relation

 there should be a way to contact lords without having to find them on the other side of the map couriers and emissaries would be a way you should also be able to talk with them while theyre in jail at least if its your jail

 the ai could use improvements riders still frequently crash into trees ladders are sometimes ignored during sieges cavalry attached to infantry formations will ride ahead to their death instead of staying close archers in the same formation will prefer forming one vulnerable long line unflinching even when clearly being overrun by cavalryinfantry instead of splitting up and moving around during ai control  which i imagine is a limitation of the formations system  but i wish the ai itself could handle smarter splitting of troops enemies will constantly stream at you when respawning instead of trying to regroup and have a sizable force for a new wave though your troops are guilty of doing the same also during sieges one unit will sometimes get stuck and you cant end the battle without exiting the map and restarting it

still it is generally competent enough to make the gameplay fun i just feel like its a few steps away from being truly great i hope to one day come back to it and replay it as an rts where i dodge the occasional arrow with troop command being a fully viable play style

overall rating 8 out of 10 swadian butter caravans some changes to the way you gain experience and how the ai handles itself as well as further improving on game stability would bring it over the finish line and all of these seem doable with time

#####

no real development in 2 years thats more than enough time to add a mod button

after reading a top negative review that really opened my eyes i have to agree with the following

no feasts or events
no claimantsusurpers
no promised gangbrigand playstyle
villages dont count as fiefs only useless castles and town do
no upgradable villages
no naval combat
rtr system from warband discarded a clown could become a faction leader overnight
no lords consipiring on each others no duels 0 political intrigue
no political quests and denouncement quests
no deserters
no deeper courtships just gamble rng no poems
no real reason to visit townscastlevillages at all
no camping
lots of other content removeddiscarded
meme ingame economy
meme ingame diplomacy
lots of exploitearly game is a choreboring

according to steam i have currently 19676 hours of bannelord i guess its a lot

alright let me get this straight for the lazy readers 

yes bannerlord is a great game but bannerlord is also an unfinished game 

thank you for your time bye bye 

for the others

bannerlord has great potential but since it has been released four years ago early access included i guess its kind of silly to still talk about having potential at this point 


pros

 battles are incredibly cool and satisfying the fighting system is surprising and hard to master these two points are the reasons why nothing compares to bannerlord and make this game a truly unique experience period

 cities castles and villages are very pleasing i personnally love to walk inside doing nothing special but since we can also talk directly to the sellers lords villagers only by clicking on their portrait while on the campaign map there is no point to visit these places unless you like tourism odd

 you can marry have children train them and then play your heir once your character dies yes you can die for good 

 hat off for the amazing soundtrack because we never talk enough about music in games

 start and mid campaign is pretty nice


cons

 but the endgame is repetitive and dull

 the game has basically two states peace or war

 no real diplomacyrelationship features barely any dynastysuccession management no big event foreign invasion etc no disaster plague diseases etc and so on a major problem to me

 every member of your family will follow you blindly no conflict no betrayal nope boring

 you can kill a sons lord then visit the lord he will greet you with a hello my friend  sigh

 you can raid villages in the campaign map but cant enter into these villages to actually do it in first person with a small army in the other hand you can do massive battles and sieges nonsense

 snowballing the map is relatively easy you can conquer city after city and thats pretty much it nothing special or truly unexpected will ever happen at this point also boring

 you can use a few mods sometimes a lot to fix these issues and have a richer experience sadly having mods also means incompatibilities and crashes if you follow this path expect many hours testing your mods and begging for updates on steam or nexus not fun

 endless updates full of fixes have been provided by taleworlds with barely new content inside until recently with 123 patch but the game still lacks important mechanics that have been suggested by the community for ages


a few more thoughts

from my pov taleworlds is another studio that have released an unfinished game for around 50 and then expected people to wait 10 years to have it completed not cool and dishonest

so yeah great game but also very frustrating management thanks or not to its developpers that should give it more attention 

mount  blade bannelord deserves better than this

these reasons are why im giving it a thumbs down sorry because its currently 2024 and we should be able to make alliances or fight our own siblings in a civil war

consider yourself warned

toggle archers to hold fire using f4
hold alt to display distance to enemy army
wait until army is 100 metres away
toggle archers to fire
accidentally alt  f4 the game

fucking incredible i actually fell for it

you can have a child with a wife you spent 400 days not seeing 
1010 realistic

2k hours of gameplay on in multiplayer i can now say this game is not worth it unless you only enjoy playing single player

tldrconclusion
this game is a jarring overambitious mess but watching your character grow from a baby into a unique leader watching your army grow from a band of young recruits into unique and devastating fighting force that would make any man in its way pray watching your friends and foes form and the world around you change because of it are things i would say only this game has been able to give me no other


as with many early access games my relationship with this game is one of love and hate
so much of this game is stuff ive always wanted in games like this and havent seen done well pretty much anywhere else
 smaller scale unit tactics with more focus on the individual and the feeling of actually being there in a medieval battle
 simulated and dynamic systems like economy logistics morale intuitive unit progression even combat physics to calculate how much damage is being done by a particular weapon at a particular speed with a particular type of strike through a particular armour
 rpg style skills with really creative perks and progression that very subtly and effectively makes you feel like you and your character are improving together
 etc
now all of the things i just mentioned i would say put this game above many other strategy and battle sim games because they are things which increase immersion they help put you in the shoes of your character and feel like youre playing in a living breathing world the strength of this game is its depth and immersion
if any of you reading this have played this game at all youve probably noticed something very wrong with that statement
this game will constantly rip you right out of your immersion and make you very consciously aware that youre playing a video game
 the combat physics dont make any sense half the time theres been an up to date realistic battle mod on the nexus for the majority of this games existence which fixes these issues making combat far more satisfying and im shocked the devs still havent addressed this
 walking around towns and villages which should be where immersion really shines feels like youre walking through a ghost town with statue npcs with terrifying expressions who dont say anything and a town_ambiencemp3 being played through hidden speakers in the facade houses 
 dialogue between characters may as well be non existent with visual novel text boxes with bland writing and the most nonsensical dialogue skill checks ive possibly ever seen
 the repetitive monotonous nature of putting your men into the same positions and the same formations at the start of every battle every 5 minutes
these things are scratching the surface of the list of things that give constant immersive whiplash while playing this game
i understand these things can come with early access titles but with this game supposedly leaving early access this year i dont see enough of these issues being addressed and im concerned that tw is running out of time andor budget 
im not acutely aware of how game development works but im slightly baffled that they seem to come out with new armours every patch when more items is the last thing the game needs right now i worry the loud minority of the reddit page etc are giving the devs a false image of what players care about i couldnt care less if imperial armour is unbalanced or if the long glaive is overpowered during game release when every npc i look at makes me feel like im playing a parody maybe im in the minority too but to me it really feels like the devs have their priorities mixed up and that this game will remain very much unfinished during its 10 release which is a real shame considering how much i love the unique feeling this game can give me in its strongest moments
the concept is so brilliant but as much as i want it to i just dont think this game will ever reach its full potential

that being said i will continue to love this game and try to contribute feedback where i can for likely years to come and will recommend it for its strengths nonetheless

#####

its passable as early access but it needs a lot of work in my opinion

here is a brief list of what would make the game better overall

 more dialogue options not asking for a fullblown rpg or anything here but more than 12 dialogue options would be a welcome improvement

 i noticed several visual glitches with the clothing facial hair etc 

 graphics need improvement these visuals can be extremely ugly in places really needs fixed

 multiple game breaking bugs in different quests

 towns taverns castles etc feel very dead and lifeless kinda reminded me of assassins creed 1 in terms of its deadness 

 many many other more minor things

it has a good foundation of a game but to be frank i expected a lot more out of a game that has been in development for the last 8 years

#####

if you are scrolling through the reviews for this game you may notice that most of the positive reviews allude to how great the game will be or how they cant wait to see how it will turn out in the future while there is certainly a case to be made for that i think any potential buyer of this game needs to be aware of the current state as of march 30th 2021 of the game

the skeleton of the proposed game experience is in place you can run around a map fighting looters and armies or you can join a kingdom and do so but thats pretty much it in terms of things that are working as they should there is a lot of big fixes that still need to come after quite some time of being in beta this has left the current game community rather frustrated as the devs keep making small fixes for minor issues noone seemingly asked for and all but ignore big longstanding issues ie siege ai that people have practically begged for the devs have also alienated all of the major players in the modding community which is what is currently keeping the game alive by ignoring their pleas for better communication on upcoming fixes and not listening to their suggested simple fixes for alot of the larger issues plaguing the game this resulted in said modders creating a open letter to the devs voicing their displeasure with the current state of the game and the devs communication and announcing their abstaining from modding till improvement in these areas

will you get a couple hours of fun out of the game as it stands yes but you need to note that the game is very bare bones currently and that modding is going to be constant process of updating and reinstalling as the game updates and breaks all mods and you previous savegame compatibility 

is it worth the listed price for what it currently offers absolutely not get it on sale if you must or wait till final release 

as a long standing fan of the franchise im left with a pretty sour taste in my mouth but ill continue to check in and remain hopeful that future fixes make the game more playable and enjoyable

i threw a javelin to my rulers head in front of the entire kingdom and then they made me king 2 minutes later

#####

ive played this game for over 600 hours so far and i have got to say that it has been an experience and a half

heres a rough timeline of how ive spent my playtime so far
 0  10hrs working out how the game works the unit command system in particular took my a while to work out properly though i now find it so intuitive and easy to issue commands quickly
 10  80hrs playing a bunch of campaigns where i didnt progress far past the early game this period of playing was some of the most fun ive had with any game just exploring the huge map the different factions the troop trees battle tactics smithing trading etc was a huge part of it
 80  200hrs gaining a deeper understanding of game mechanics and learning to get through the midgame and into the earlylate game
 200  350hrs a couple of very long campaigns putting my learning to the test and eventually conquering the whole map this could get fairly grindy and frustrating at times due to the huge amount of kingdom management required and the impossibility of being everywhere at once
 350   600hrs exploring mods and several long modded campaigns the game is very modable and the community has created some really great stuff
 600hrs  present burnout hitting hard so only jumping in occasionally jumping in at this point i feel like ive exhausted nearly all of the available content im mostly going to be taking a break from the game until full release or some major mods get finished

pros
 great strategy experience
 first person combat is an excellent balance of challenge and ease of learning
 battles are super epic you can literally fight a huge pitched battle over a bridge field or mountain pass and then fight an offensive or defensive battle in a castle or city all in first person
 campaign map is well done similar look to total war games but first person the ui has a lot of information but is still easy to use
 the game is very moddable as mentioned and there are a bunch of really great mods both big and small that run quite well and without crashing too often
 very immersive probably the best medieval simulator game ive ever seen 
 its very open world and youre not really forced to do anything there are so many ways to play the game and theyre all legit from warband leader to caravan trader to highwayman to emperor it adds a tonne of play time

cons
 the game is still in early access but development seems to be going quite slow with a lot of features still very barebones and not looking like they will be fleshed out too much more before full release
 the vanilla diplomacy is awful the enemy ai will not make peace unless you capture nearly their entire nobility and your factions ai nobles will not make peace if you are winning that much this leads to super prolonged wars that can be hugely frustrating to deal with there are also no nonaggresion pacts military alliances or even war cooldown timers after making peace this can be solved somewhat though by installing the diplomacy mod
 the questing system is really underused its just that the game has decent questing mechanics there are just not that many quests and the ones that there are are small nonessential and nonrewarding
 the main quest is a shtstorm it is actually easier to complete the game without any fingers than to complete the game while following the main quest upon obtaining the dragon banner you are given no reward and are cursed with having to run around the map putting out fires and then having half the factions enter into an eternal war against you it is so painful

tldrsummary
its a great game with a lot of potential think total war  skyrim  crusader kings  a bunch of stuff those games have i would definitely recommend this game to anyone and im watching to see where taleworld take it from here


#####

this game is hard for me to rate after years of early access it is still a buggy unfinished mess development is extremely slow feels like it is being done by one guy in his spare time a lot of effort seems to be put into balancing multiplayer despite core features not even being implemented or polished yet leaving balance changes pointless and quickly obsolete anyway each new update also seems to bring new bugs with it that linger for months without fixes the new story mode is extremely simple and only add annoyances to the gameplay at its core the game is just the same game that they have released several times already just with a new coat of paint

but the gameplay it just works and it is damn addictive just like the previous games i can easily get lost for weeks just playing around in the sandbox singleplayer world playing around with different builds combining different troops and tactics joining and taking over different factions

if you are thinking of buying it maybe wait for a sale or pick up mount and blade warband for a bargain try it out for a bit if you like it you will like this game too like i said it is essentially the same game with a few new features and graphics and be ready to having to use mods to unlock the full potential spare time modders will often fix things in days which takes the official devs months or years at this point i kinda hope the devs just completely stop developing the game so it wont keep breaking mods for pointless tiny updates and so modders could get on with more ambitious mods and conversions like we had with warband

it is an aquired taste if the core gameplay clicks with you you can easily get over the mountains of jank and unfinished stuff and the workeffort required for installing mods

#####

as of patch 110 they are finally introducing mechanics that tw promised but never delivered on eg stable and streamlined ux gang mechanics ambushing ruler specific armors to name a few up to this point in recent months tw has moved the game in a much better direction if you asked me a year ago i wouldve said that this game is like warband but worse  and somehow still pretty fun even if gravely unbalanced and roughedged now this game is simply on par with warband imo while doing a lot more somehow theres enough bread to righteously succeed warband but not enough butter for taste at this rate with the game continuing to be polished improved and finalized all the more bannerlords potential for the definitive mb experience will be quickly realized in the patches to come i like many others still cherish warband and i think this is largely because of its simple polished sandbox gameplay loop its like bad company 2 for battlefield once bannerlord reaches that level of polish there will be no more complaints from my end lots of work left for tw but finally worth playing and recommending to newcomers at this stage of release very fun and getting more fun as time goes on 799910 and creeping up

it aint finished chief

stop leaning on modders to finish your games

when you purchase a product you do not expect to get banned from multiplayer for violating chinese censorship rules this includes having the incorrect steam id this affects accessibility of a game feature and hence is a relevant buy consideration

tw has made some claims to invistigate it but so far without any further results tw mods here on steam forums have just purged a thread instead of at least locking it with a comment why which called for attention regarding this censorship note also the discussion there was surprisingly calm without getting overboard 

i am glad to removechange the review when this issue is settled the only possible correct way

update 03112021

since this review the only thing about it i can find is claim by tw that they are going to investigate it but no further updates since even if i employ a search on that topic again i find stale updates like this one 
httpstechraptornetgamingnewsmountblade2bannerlordbansallegedlygivenforviolatingchineselaw

regarding the game itself
the skill leveling system is a pure grind for some very annoying skills there is a cheese workaround in some way which is totally unimmersive like for example to train roguary fast you need to stage prison escapes for others over and over again people you dont care about and dont know just to get the xp most ways of doing xp gives no xp you can also not train fighting skills in tournaments and arena because its reduced to almost zero tw thinks there is only one way to play the game  as a vassal or soldier of another kingdom complete breakage compared to warband 

then there are skills like smithing which are tedious and boring the ui is terrible but you can craft items for the cheapest resources worth around 200 gold and sell them for around 90000 gold at very low levels which you get to very fast

you go trade with a noble one sell him 5 swords for all the fortune he owns and they are happy to sign the deal then they are in dire need of money and sell all their land for gold worth selling 9 swords

if you think its a bug no its like that since the beginning and its not just one specific item the prices for items are crazy one sword costs 5k another one has 1 more damage and consts 30k or 50k

with smithing you basically have infinite money easy and fast you can buy all the realm and the nobles will happily sell it to you no army needed just craft some 6090 weapons

i have no clue what the devs took to make that real and keep it like that with no changes

i wanna start off by saying i really enjoy this game and ive been playing the hell out of it for the past week at the time of writing i bought the game on launch and honestly i was pretty unimpressed and decided id wait a while then come back to see how things were going with that out of the way heres some of my thoughts on where its at right now

i cannot recommend anyone to buy this game in good conscious unless you genuinely dont care about value for money the game is still mb if you loved warband you will enjoy this game the problem is that theres nothing at all beneath the surface gameplay the choices you make and the people you befriend or make enemies of simply do not matter at all the game outside of combat feels extremely lifeless every npc says the same 2 or 3 lines your dialogue choices dont actually matter either companions have less depth than warband and spouses might as well just be your acquaintance that occasionally carries your child towns and villages are absolutely dead as well taverns are especially funny with musicians consistently playing invisible lutes and maidens pouring ale until the end of time dont get me wrong the gameplay is obviously the major selling point but at 50 i was hoping for a world thats at least more interactive than warbands not somehow less

the ai is incredibly easy to manipulate and often quite stupid you can stop any siege in its tracks by starting a siege on something of theirs close by theres almost no semblance of actual strategy for your allies or enemies in battles as well 99 of large battles have one or both sides forming an infantry circle around their archers and letting the cavalry fight among themselves you havent experienced true hell until you get knocked out in the arena and all thats left is two horse archers circling each other for 20 minutes missing every single arrow until they finally have to pull out their swords thats not to say the combat isnt fun but its certainly not polished at all

my final reason for not recommending this game comes when you look at the patch notes its all crash fixes theres some new singleplayer content some future plans thats all well and good but scroll through all the patch notes and 90 of them are fixing crashes that seemingly occur for every interaction in the game im not implying they shouldnt be fixing crashes but rather pointing out a worrying trend this game has been in development hell since its announcement and i doubt its coming out of early access any time soon i want to see this title and tw reach their full potential so badly but im also a realist this game still has years to go before id wager ill be able to proudly proclaim this product is worth 50 usd tax i will be ecstatic the day i can come back to this review and update it but for now its a no from me


#####

modders are faster then the developers of this game it feels like updates are coming out just to break the mods because they dont add anything new

#####

a good sequel to a great game

graphics combat system trading and battles are the strength of the game
diplomacy developing your own fiefs and creating a kingdom is the weakest

the game is so complex that the developers have not been able to make decent ai on the tactical map for three years since release to create a kingdom you will have to grind main quest  clan ranks after which the whole world will declare war on you without a kingdom you dont have ability to call an army  have fun fighting with your band of 150200 against armies of 6001200 men
fighting is fun and interesting but sometimes there are too many fights  the gameplay becomes too repetitive
all kings are deranged and nonsensical starting 3 wars at a time and making a peace when starting to destroy enemy too much
developing town is slow as fuck takes weeks of real time no upgrades for the villages you can have 1mil coins but no way of developing of your land

would like deeper diplomacy easier access to kingdom content not as a vassal of a lunatic kings better kingdom content less useless fights and more meaningful tactical battles

#####

now that the honeymoon is over i think we can be honest about the state of this game

as of june 2020 it is difficult to recommend this based on asking price

while this is a generally fun game it is severely lacking in content

as a matter of fact aside from the crafting system and a few changes in the way you manage your kingdom and your band this is almost identical in content to the last game

hell even the dialogues are lifted from the original game

naturally the game does look a lot better than its older counterparts but after 8 years in development it think it is pretty much a given

obviously this is work in progress and taleworlds has been slowly trickling down content but considering this has been in development since at least 2012 this is very disappointing

anyway im hoping to eventually be proven wrong with this review but for now i cant recommend it

it is sad that i have to do this but i just cant give it a positive review yet warband this game predecessor is one of my most played games ever in the past so ive been following this for years and years the prerelease trailers showed an incredible update to the graphics and the battles looked great and they are in fact some of the best part of the game but that however is pretty much the only improvement

you see it really tells you that something is wrong when you just cant finish a save not because the game is too bad but because it is too tiresome this game is not marketed as an infuriating frustrating game like some souls like game are that require repetition and learning so when you find yourself so pissed and tired having to grind army after army having to go to from village to village recruiting one or two soldiers because the village wont give you more due to being at war with you and if you force them to give you your relations will drop and they wont give you recruits even in peace times all the while having to dodge enemies it gets old really fast 

this game has some major jumps that could be really nice if implemented in the right way the first jump is upgrading your clan and getting a companion the second is becoming a mercenary and finally being able to beat other nobles then you can become a vassal and you will most likely be gifted a fief but that is when things stop being so fun the next jump is to finally having your own kingdom but you better be prepared to spend hundreds of hours dealing with the most frustrating mechanics and ai

firstly having a fief requires either a garrison or you need to be close by so a party of 150 wont take it from you but the constant war the villagers and caravans being ambushed by bandits or enemies and the villages being raided means that the city will never ever pay for its own garrison so a city cant pay its own garrison but you need to somehow pay  your own party wages plus the garrison which means you have 0 time to breathe because the wages in this game are expensive and daily not weekly as it used to be in warband and the day goes by fast

maybe the wages are not expensive doe maybe it is just absurdly hard to earn money if not from constant battle there used to be a way to make millions being a blacksmith but it is mostly patched now caravans cost around 15k or 22k if you want better troops but it doesnt matter because it will get attacked anyway you have to be very very lucky to have a caravan making 500 gold daily workshops will halt production in the first week or so due to lack of profits and both caravans and workshops are limited depending on your clan level

but lets say you overcame all that the easy and still sort of fun part and decided o start your own kingdom well that is the major problem of this game diplomacy never heard of it the game is simply relentless it is just war war war during my last save 3 kingdoms were very strong with 15k armies one of them was very very far away behind one of the other stronger one but for some godsdamn reason it would always declare war on me and cross the continent with 3 or 4 armies to force me to pay tributes 

but lets say you actually defeat their armies again and again using strategy patience and lots of time would this make them pay you tribute well of course not your inventory will have half a million in items looted your prisons will have 40 nobles from their kingdom yet they will still demand tribute to stop sending their men to be massacred making you have to go around reconquering cities or lifting sieges almost always outnumbered 5 to 1

but lets say they are busy fighting each other for once and leave you be for some weeks you finally have time to convince some lords to join your cause after they join you give them a nice fief full of troops and even give some of your best troops to them well good luck with that the npc lords will have no money because fiefs dont profit much remember and it is their only source of income if not in an army with you and you will watch the troops in the garrison slowly disappear due to unpaid wages oh the troops you gave to the lord also gone same reason  giving troops and money to your lords fix this a little bit but very little bit and it is extremely annoying have to chase them around the ai is not very bright so it becomes truly tiresome having to farm the money train the troops gift them and 5 minutes later see the notification that the lord was taking prisoner losing most of the hard work you did

buuut lets say the lords actually manage to hold their own and even create an army well the war will eventually start and while you are busy sieging or defending a fief you will have to watch an 800 men army chasing a party of  40 which has twice the speed of the army once the small party is out of range the army will go for a good objective like defending a fief or sieging a poorly defended one but wait is that another small party close by oh how dare they and there goes your army again chasing a random party obviously not catching it sometimes it stays in this loop until there is no more cohesion and it disbands meanwhile you lost another 3 castles while trying to defend one

anyway the problem is the late game sometimes you dont have time to even sell your loot it is war war war there is no diplomacy alliances intrigue or options to talk directly with enemy kings to have better terms nothing you cant manage cities talk to lords go to villages try to buy stuff nothing there is no time it is only pay tribute and defend my last save i gave up because i was fighting against 2 huge kingdoms and 2 weaker ones eventually settling to pay absurd amounts of tribute to the stronger ones making my lords very very poor with 30 men parties to focus on the weaker ones only to have a third big kingdom declare war on my almost immediately and invade my kingdom with five five huge armies with almost 2k men each was it possible to fight back yes but at that point i was simply too tired it was not funny anymore the grind was too annoying 

so yeah just a short review with some points that crossed my mind not much honestly i could talk a lot more

needs more campy voice lines i fear for the future of bannerlord memes

 there is no openworld game of thrones rpg 

modders fine ill do it myself

mb 2 is brilliant and it surpasses its predecessor in almost any manner you could care to mention its also really far from being finished ive spend entire days messing with it and i enjoyed my time with it but i wasnt ever really doing anything i hadnt already done in warband apart from commanding troops with some tactical understanding beyond charge which is very welcome

dont buy it yet wait another year its great but it needs a lot more time in the oven

great game ive hardly noticed any problems mostly just typos really wish there was a way to do coop campaigns where your friends replace your companions in your armies i would honestly pay just as much as i did for the game for a multiplayer expansion like that great rpg with a unique twist of controlling your own kingdoms if you work for it

#####

when bannerlord was announced in 2012 i was in the middle of finishing high school now ive graduated high school went on a gap year graduated university lost my virginity found a job moved out of my mums basement changed careers got a new job survived the pandemic and this game is still no way near finished at the rate taleworlds is developing this game itll probably take another 10 years of development time and by that time ill probably have a wife and kids with a white picket fence

after having so much development time before they even released the game in 2020  the two years this game has been in early access i cannot recommend this game in early access its still too shallow and feels too incomplete honestly all they needed to do was remake warband but give it new graphics and maybe add one or two new features for it to be classed as a new game this game at its current state is just too shallow

ive been trying to hold off from playing this game until its at least out of early access but at the rate taleworlds is developing this game ill never get to play this game

its going to be a long wait until harvesting season

#####

im a big fan of the total war game series especially rome and medieval but i always wished i could do more than just telling the troops where to go and then watching them fight this game is one of the closest games to achieving that allowing you to build up armies and fight battles and take part in sieges but rather than watching from afar as things unfold you can lead from the front riding at the front of a cavalry charge scaling ladders to get into an enemy fort and fighting on the walls its great

#####

love the game but

has serious lag issues with menus which never used to be there so every menu it stutters for 510 seconds on an ssd pretty sure its having a major problem with loading the thumbnails for items and units so every time you wanna trade lag every time you take prisoners lag every time you wanna upgrade your troops lag

may seem small but having this constantly with every menu you open gets seriously annoying id say get it because its great and the mods will be unbelievable but wait until they fix this damn stuttering

also dear devs literally no one cares about mp thats not what your fanbase is so stop updating that rubbish and focus purely on the core game cheers

#####

normally i would refrain from making any reviews especially early access
but this is a special one
other reviews have mentioned the pros and cons but none of them have mentioned that for the last 10 days by the time i am writing this the game have updated 10 times even on the weekends as i remember which i am very much surprised which means this is much much better than any early access out there
while this means that mods are not stable just yet this does mean that the devs are actually really paying attention to their game and not making plans for other endeavors such as microtransactions or obscure dlcs

dont buy if you want minimal bugs 
buy if you want to support the game and the devs

in my now 23 hours of gameplay in the bannerlord of which 90 has been spent in shackles or under siege i can safely say i am yet to experience the game i dont really know why but it feels like i am getting worse at video games so having a singleplayer game like this one is nice since the only ones who laugh at me are the ai soldiers next to my corpse i am yet to find a woman that wants me and every kingdom i join is destroyed within 45 minutes of gameplay the lords have so far bullied me into poverty through elitist laws causing me to have no influence or fiefs i shouldnt like this game but everytime i see it in my library i have this sudden urge to raid mongol villages the forest people are pretty bad too today i will try to play the main quest which i have avoided in fear of losing that too

#####

look ill be honest here bannerlord was released in a basically unfinished state however im still recommending this game for two reasons
1 the bones of it are good i played a lot in early access and had enough fun for it to be worth the price in spite of the many unimplemented features
2 the bevy of fantastic mods available through the workshop make it absolutely worth it

for anyone still on the fence i recommend starting off by installing if nothing else the realistic battle mod rbm it rebalances all of the factions and makes combat much more interesting if youre still hankering for more there are plenty of mods that improve diplomacy faction mechanics settlement management trading and many many more facets of the game

that isnt to say that its a shame that the devs couldnt finish their game it sucks that this is a thing nowadays where publishers rush a product out the door and expect the player base to take up the slack with mods and fan patches but i think its a testament to the core playability and funness of a game when theres such a robust and dedicated modding community out there trying their damnedest to keep the game alive and functioning

youre lucky taleworlds count your blessings lets hope your next one will be a little more polished

#####

although i really love this game i cannot recommend it the open field battles are fun but thats pretty much the only thing this game has going for it u every other aspect of the game is lacking u

list
  diplomacy is nonexistent
  aipathing is horrible units will charge whatever is closest to them this makes it extremely easy to cheese the ai you can just use your cavalry to run through the enemy while your archers pick them off 
  siege battles are practically unplayable the ai sometimes gets stuck on the siege towers or simple refuses to use them all together
  characters are extremely shallow  every lord noble or companion feels like an empty husk there are no dynamics between the player and the lordsnoblescompanions let alone a dynamic between lordsnobles themselves
  choices feel insignificant everything you do feels little of impact
  economy is lackluster you can have your own businesses or caravans and certain item prices will adapt to whatever the villages near it produce but it doesnt go further than that
  towns feel dead the only time you visit a town physically is to buy a business or for a catch the spy quest
  lacking features from previous game no companion quests setting up camp books  we dont even have feasts 
  promised crime system is nonexistent 
  campaign map problems lack of features ai sometimes will go deep into the enemy territory to raid or set up a siege you cannot suggest a course of action to lords like you could in the previous game you cannot even tell your companion parties what to do even the pathing here is horrible caravans that are in the proximity of an enemy will not adapt their path but will just move back and forth
  ai is just pathetic overall in combat as well as on the campaign map if they siege one of your castles or towns just siege one of theirs and they will stop immediately when the ai raises an army it doesnt even bring enough food for a week ai doesnt use any tactics either during combat they just charge their horsearchers first put their cav on the side and put the rest of their units behind the ai does 0 effort to protect their cavunits
list

its only 2 months away from its anniversary release and overall we havent seen much improvement there is still even small things that are broken like certain perks smithing item prices  i am sure i am missing a lot of other issues its a shame because this game has so much potential

#####

mount and blade has come a long way from its original inception and theres a whole lot for armagan and the taleworlds team to be proud of that said with the announcement of bannerlords full release coming in just 1 month i find myself completely shocked and disappointed as a mount and blade fan since 2006 starting my journey with the original mb alpha i have been along for the whole ride and have never had a problem supporting this company over long development cycles and active beta testing periods because their games always continued to improve and deliver a richer gameplay experience when bannerlord launched the graphics and scale were impressive but it was a far cry from warband in terms of gameplay features and interesting mechanics now 25 years of early access later i really cant say its that much better than launch in terms of gameplay features and interesting mechanics theyve polished the balance fixed a lot of bugs and crashes but they havent really added anything significant to the core game sure theyve worked on multiplayer theyve worked on a console port but all of these additions to the game are just to reach a larger audience not actually improving the core game itself i think its fair to say that long time fans were expecting a lot more from taleworlds and wouldnt have minded an even longer wait to get this game feature complete but as it is its about to release in what most would consider a woefully unfinished state its a well polished early access game right now just a month before full release but so much is still missing the gameplay loop itself is pretty much non existent in bannerlord because supporting mechanics arent fleshed out kingdom building and clan building mechanics are extremely shallow like just a shell of what they couldshould be and quests are all the same repeatable go here kill that go here talk to x minutia no matter where youre at on the map theres no unique flavor to different factions just different skins for their units and slightly different focus for how they fight all of this is fine for an early access game and ive never once complained but to see now that theyre calling it finished and releasing it in a month with a significantly higher price tag in several countries is incredibly disconcerting and disappointing to a long time fan like me and im sure many others

im not saying you cant have fun with this game im not saying it isnt worth a buy on sale im just saying that the devs dropped the ball on their most ambitious title yet and it will be up to modders now to carry the torch and make this game great my only hope now is that the full release will mean greater support and accessibility for modders that theyll be able to get in there and do the job theyve been trying to do for years without constant patches screwing up their builds i sadly cant recommend this game for the price its at currently if this is indicative of the full 10 release earlier we were buying a promise from a trusted developer now what you see is what you get and its largely a disappointment i especially cant recommend the game at its future raised price after full release wait for this game to be on massive sale and better yet wait a year or two for mods to be in a really good state then it might be worth it 

just my perspective and i wish anyone happy gaming and hope that new players will be pleasantly surprised with the game as opposed to disappointed but from my perspective its been a big let down to this point

#####

an absolutely awesome game thats highly engrossing and a lot of fun  
however at the time of writing this the game is very early access due to the popularity of the previous game and the demand for this game they may have released it a lot earlier than most people would have liked although the devs seem to listen to suggestions and are steadily improving a lot of aspects with regular updates which may make the game better than if they waited until it was more finished before releasing it 

single player is so much fun with so many different ways to play it
become a merchant a mercenary a smuggler a blacksmith a lordlady or even a king or queen of a kingdom you can also lead or fight in armiessieges manage castles and cities get married have kids there are 6 races you can play as with different perks you can customise your male or female character then chose what life they had which affect your starting out skill levels

there are different difficulty levels if you havent played the previous game i recommend starting out on very easy then when you get the hang of it go to realistic you also cant play this like the previous game seen people who tried with hilarious results 
one warband player went charging into some cavalry was killed in one hit and his dead body rag dolled off his horses xd like in kingdom come deliverance you start the game off as a peasant and feel like a peasant

you also have an option to have lords perma die or not die there are pros and cons to having it on or off if it is on and you die in battle like with the npc lords and ladies theres a chance you be captured and a chance you will stay dead 
if you do die and you have married and had a child then you can carry on playing as as the child currently a child takes 1512 days to grow up to an 18 year old a day not sped up takes 1 min 36 secs but if quickly waiting a day will take 10 seconds theres 4 months in a year so a child will take between 4032 hrs to 42 hrs real time to grow up atmtime of posting this

when you start the game you create a clan which is your family and any one you have hired when you get your clan level high enough you can create your own kingdom if you havent joined an npc kingdom then you are essentially a king or queen and can persuadecharm enemy clan leaders into becoming your vassals unless you have a dynasty of grown up children you need vassals if you strive for world domination also with other lordsladies you can use influence to create armies and have huge battles huge battles are fun feels a bit like a total war game but played from a first person perspective as a peasantmercenary lord or general

multiplayer is fun but the vast majority of the people in it have possibly played the game for hundreds of hours in multiplayer there is a captain mode where you strategically command troops and there is a 60 vs 60 siege battle of only real life players which is awesome 
60 vs 60 siege is so cool you have real life players pushing the rams managing the ballistas throwing boulders at the invading forces sometimes you might even see players holding their shield up to protect other players on their team while i definitely recommend the game and while it is playable it does have a long way to go

the vast majority of the negative reviews seem to be people who havent got a good pc or were expecting a more finished bug free and optimised game so i suggest you look in the discussions and news for updates before deciding when you want to buy it

also about the multiplayer anti cheat the anti cheat is battleye i like that theres an anti cheat and that its not useless denuvo but ive avoided installing battleye when playing ark survival evoled its a highly invasive and from researching it a minority of cases have had malicious problems since installing it but because most players dont have a noticeable problem people think its safe im just not sure if it is actually safe just highly invasive or if it is smartly malicious either way dont really want it on my computer so will uninstall it when im not playing on multiplayer would kinda prefer for honorsvermintides 2s easy anti cheat as its less invasive and processor hungry while being highly effective

killing looters is the real life version of fighting a fifth grader unfair fun and would do again10

#####

they dont make em like this any more kids

i played the first mb the month it came out in early access anyone else remember the zendar arena i was 13 years old and i can still remember the sheer sense of wonder as i stepped out into a basicallyempty map with only two factions and ps2era graphics development was slow but it was well worth the wait the dev team were incredible talking one to one with their playerbase and dedicating years to a game which for all they knew might go nowhere

now bannerlord has brought the series into the modern era no it isnt the finished polished product yet then again neither was mb1 or warband or really anything in the mb series so far the joy of these games is that despite feeling cobbled together and a bit makeshift they still offer 10x the depth and variety of many triplea titles 

well worth the wait and there will be plenty more waiting trust me and well worth supporting one of the most longterm dedicated dev teams this side of dwarf fortress

#####

remember its not a war crime if theyre sea raiders

#####

can recommend this game for some late nights for some casual gaming

#####

im not sure what it is about the mount  blade series that i love so much

bannerlord has horrible diplomacy terrible ai no way to actually rule a kingdom meaningfully youre a ruler in name but cant direct armies that you dont lead yourself for instance

however the gameplay is just so good no game gives the same feeling of progression going from having no army and no money to being a millionaire leader of a kingdom is magnificent this game is something you just have to try and enjoy

#####

1010 would f1 f3 again

#####

between tws butchering of the internal systems to force a console launch and their refusal to address community concerns bannerlord represents a feature barren but graphically impressive act of designer hubris the community was used as their beta testers for 3 years only to have all their concerns ignored by the developers they didnt even obtain distribution rights for their campaign textures so modders cannot make changes to the vanilla map in the editor without either not being able to save or the map just being broken 

the campaign mechanics are non existent and were it not for the modding community the game would be a barely playable mess hugely dissapointed that this is what we got after a decade of waiting

#####

my overall impression is possitive but that doesnt mean there are not a lot of issues with the game
game is fun uniqe and has a very well built combat system those are solid wins for the game so it gets a thumbs up 
sadly after more than a year of early access my expectations are kinda let down needs a lot more features and a good amounth of bug fixes
if you like this type of game buy it it has a lot of potential but dont expect a perfect product

#####

the potential that this game couldve achieved but never did is what makes me write my first ever bad review
sure i got my money back given the hours ive spent paying it but looking back those were hours spent searching for a game that is simply not there

main quest line has no soul and does nothing to improve the rpg part or making a good purpose for a cause i found myself avoiding the main quest line just so i can play more of the earlymidgame because as soon as you declare yourself every fucking army plus their mother is going to come down on you or the faction you are part of and your ai allies are a bunch of saltless crackers and the crappy implemented settlement management comes into place so you are basically turning the game into a boring attrition sandbox that is painful to keep together and a chore
also you assemble the banner and then what nothing you cant even wave it around in battle people dont treat me different doesnt give any bonus etc etc all this in a game called bannerlord

what gave me hope and kept pulling me back to play it was the earlymid game it is really fun at the start you create your warband you go around bettering your army improving your character theres lots of choice here catching some bandits going to war against similar lowtier factions doing stuff for other houses or making money by pledging your warband to a lords cause for a fee joining them in battle raiding caravans crushing enemy legions etc
this is all fun and games but in order to keep your army going strong and growing big you need money this means steady income unless you want to cheese and make the game even more boring by this point which will at some point obligate you to either fully join a faction or creating your own dont make me go into how soulsucking it is to create your own so you can start owning settlements castles and get that steady income this is where the fun stops and you start having to manage cities politics and your allies which would be fine and an enjoyable part of making a kingdom if

if you didnt have to physically go to those settlements just to manage them yes really you cant even delegate this
if your allies wouldnt make stupid ai decisions that eventually cause you to lose your settlements or theirs they are like kids given a button to destroy everything you worked for always laughing at how much renown you have to spend just to keep them in check
if enemy factions couldnt replenish big armies in a blink of an eye killing army leaders is not a good option either
if mechanics were explained at all i have 100 hours into this game and there are still things i am not curious to find out what they do only superficially or why they are not working as expected
if killing a lordleader wouldnt make everyone in the world even your allies hate you and yes im talking about you killing a guy that you are at war with and has just fucked up your entire kingdom
if interactions with the ai lordschars were diverse the dialogue is always more or less the same be it your wife your nemesis or the guy who just got his entire family murdered by you
if everything wasnt so soulless stale or devoid of meaning  

that being said battle simulations are really fun there is a lot of variety in terms of troops mechanics equipment mounts and strategies this is where the game excels and does it better than most
command of your troops could be done better though its a pain in the ass specially at the start to find the commands to command your troops there is little in a way none of a tutorial for this either the game just sends you into battle with the enemy army already coming for you time ticking and hopes you can figure it out so yes f1f3 or f1f4 since the beginning because you dont have time to try shit out

i bought this on ea years ago or something like that sad to say the game hasnt changed much since then with the updates main campaign is still boring there are still annoying bugs and many promised feature missing 
all in all a big disappointment made bigger because theres not only a good base game here but also because it could be so much more why ultimately obligate me to play a certain way when the map is so big and everything is in place to create different experiences 

ps kudus for the modders whom im sure will make me keep playing this game for years to come to think the workshop was at some time discarded as a feature by taleworlds sad

#####

ah yes bannerlord

more than a year ago the first glimpse of releasing the game to ea to be actually playable after years and years of teasing was a great moment for this game people flocked to the early access chance in huge numbers i mean everyone boarded the hype train and holy shit what a hype train it was new youtubers were born just thanks to the ea release

the game received enormous amount of support praising the new visuals the new game engine and overall look it was an instant hit on steam
then the warband community stepped in and showed the issues the game had outlined the perks and mechanics that are not working and the overall lack of content in the game outside of gathering troops and swinging swords

i thought to myself  they must be wrong the game is good it is exactly what i expected swinging swords leading troops winning battles tens of hours later and months and months irl time later after ea the realization kicked in  they are right after the novelty of the new eye catching game engine wears off this game just has nothing to offer

modding support is great for any game it keeps it alive for years to come  just look at cities skylines the modding community has kept the game alive all these years after the initial release and if one would run the numbers it still generates hefty income on sales  years after release

why am i mentioning modding support youd ask

well it is quite simple  it is acceptable for the game to be extended with great mods after initial release its just there is this elephant in the room that started to grow as soon as bannerlod hit the ea  if you step back and look at this game nothing has changed within the game itself and it has been on life support from modding community  while still being in early access

 balance fixes
 ai fixes

these two points can describe the year bannerlord has spent in ea no mechanics have been added to the game
how is it possible for a game to not change that much after a year in ea while modding community can churn out fixes for the problems the game has faster than developers can
how come the community can create and release new mechanics for the game while the developers have not even mentioned a single thing that is coming

the early access title has become a badge of shame for bannerlord


it is a fun game for the initial hours of gameplay dont get me wrong but it has nothing more to offer once the initial novelty wears off and the nonexistant roadmap or anything in that regard does not help much


i dont know what to recommend you guys  if you want couple of hours of fun sure buy it but remember that in that way you are supporting the ongoing problem with this game hence i am leaving a thumbs down for this

as a partisan warband player this game is a great sequel and provides a solid foundation for hours of fun  sieges are satisfying and battles are excellent through more diverse ways of organizing and deploying troops  
     
as someone who plays video games in general however bannerlord  is only a solid foundation  a lot of negative reviews have already pointed this out and theyre correct this game is by no means finished  yeah combat is fun but i dont spend all my hours in combat  theres a whole world out there that involves travelling politics trading and management  if all these features look shallow and feel incomplete to first time nonwarband players well thats because they are  other reviewers have listed these in more detail but maybe what bothers me most is how the whole workshops feature doesnt work  a good representation of the rest of the player experience youre introduced to a promising idea but it is by no means finished a placeholder or iou from the devsthanks for the money but trust us this is what we want to doeventuallymaybe  ive already seen modders shout out to them finish workshops and i find it amazing how a few people with often no secure financial backing can finish entirely void bannerlord concepts versus an entire team at taleworlds  
     
currently theres about 172000 reviews on this game leading me to believe theyve made at least this much in sales  im just curious as to why then there have been such infrequent updates and incomplete features  modders are great but taleworlds lets not forget their jobs are to modify the game by adding new features or overhauling systems for gameplay or rpg purposesit is not to fix this incomplete garble youve released  
    
this is already long and im sure no one will read it but to wrap up id give this game a 610there are some cool features that can give you a few hours of fun  at the same time id also give a words of cautiondont let the blue thumbsup fool youthis game is incomplete  new and returning players will initially be impressed but if youre like me this awe will quickly fade once you come to grips with the true unfinished state of the game and be disappointed by the thought of what it couldve been

wish it had co op so friends could have a joint realm or aliance and maybe even a rivalry

thanks to crpg mod team this game is number 1

mount  blade ii bannerlord is a game that will transport you to the medieval world of calradia its a game that offers an incredibly immersive experience with stunning graphics and attention to detail that will leave you breathless the game is a true masterpiece offering up a vast open world to explore with a variety of factions to choose from and a range of missions to complete the game is a new breed of action rpg that combines the best of strategy and medieval combat and it plays like taleworlds used the most upvoted nostalgia posts on reddit as a blueprint the game is a staggering technological achievement with a hybrid action realtime strategy battles where you directly control only yourself but can issue commands to your aidriven troops the game is also compatible with mods which adds another layer of immersion to the experience if youre looking for a game that will keep you engaged and entertained for hours on end mount  blade ii bannerlord is the game for you

#####

never played warband but this is one of the best war game ive ever played even though its still in early access there are so much things to do now that the modding tools are here cant imagine the things those creative modders will do hoping theyll make game of thrones and lord of the rings mods

#####

i have over 1000 hours in warband this is ea and i have over 400 hours in already are there bugs yes does it have issues yes however its still a great game despite these issues its the best medieval warlord simulator out there i have gone for months at a time not playing this then i come back and put another 100 hours in games great and with more time and polish itll be amazing and you know the mods are gonna be amazing

#####

ngl the current state of the game is kinda a joke and here is why

allot of features are missing from warband from the start you would expect that features from the previous installment would be already be in the game from the start just a small list
no cutscenes
no courtship like in warband with duels tourney honors poems
no feasts
barely any court intrige 
no desertersmanhunter parties
no tavern brawl or assassins
no sexism in warband if you were a female in the early game you would be a joke basically

also features that are promised arent in yet like troops with banners which got teased way back already before early acces bandit empire server tools aint out yet which is basically the lifeblood of warband and what is keeping it alive till this day 

multiplayer is practically dead because only 5 maps in rotation for every game mode factions are lackluster no gear system like we had in warband instead we get pick perks and cosmetics which take allot of time to farm the loot you need for a single piece up to a 1000 loot and you get between 10 and 50 loot at the end of 3 rounds

but the game also has good sides it really improved in the singleplayer department with allot of stuff that is good especially the early game is challenging and the midgame you still have plenty of stuff to do even end game if you play the campaign but its the tiny little attention to detail that is missing 

i still think this game has great potential if they polish it up to the state warband was and develop it from there 2 years early acces is a long time but keep in mind there has been allot of trouble in the world since its release 2 years ago with a 2 year pandemic bleeding into a war we just gotta be more patient eventually this game will be in a state which we will enjoy the same we did with warband with the modding community leading the game into a golden age once more

havent spoken with my family for 1110 hours highly recommend

#####

for anybody looking to buy this game id say to wait until considerable improvements are made on its development having said that i very much enjoy some aspects of this game and have sunk a fair amount of hours into it when ive been in the mood to play it

sieges are completely broken in my opinion you cannot order your men around efficiently at all without delegating command to the ai troops will crowd around the bottom of siege towers and not use ladders they also wait in large blobs getting picked off until the last minute before getting to the ladders then when they actually do go up ladders they do so as slowly as possible one at a time not very fun watching your party of men that you spent hours training up fighting looter parties getting picked off one by one by peasant archers due to their own stupidity this problem has been persistent since release and a major reason why i choose to auto resolve all sieges yet the devs spend too much time rebalancing items and perks and updating sheep models and textures that no one cares about

battles can be very frustrating particularly in villages due to the fact you spawn less than 100 metres away from the enemy and dont have any time to get into formation you should at least have predeployment options like in total war for example large battles are utterly ridiculous say you are winning a 1000 vs 1000 battle and you push back the enemy they will constantly spawn on you and it just turns into a complete brawl with disregard to formation or tactics not very good if you are not in command ie in an army i dont see why you cant end the battle after the first wave and fight large battles in stages just like in mb warband for example 

aside from the known pathfinding issues the ai is questionable at times in one on one fights ie standing still and staring at each other for a few seconds doing nothing

ordering troops can be very clumsy i feel like a command mode that allows you to place your troops using the mouse while you stay back as any good commander should would be beneficial you should also be able to order your troops to skirmish protect flanks volley fire spear brace etc as seen in mods in the previous instalment mb warband when you tell archers to advance they seem to run right up to the enemy at sword striking range without firing and immediately running away somewhere you dont want them to instead of skirmishing properly cavalry are almost impossible to control properly without delegating to the ai and may charge into spearman against your will

for a game that i and every other fan have been waiting 8 years to play i feel somewhat disapointed even though i have fun playing the game after 30 mins of playing the game my immersion is broken in some way therefore i wouldnt recommend for new players until the game is out of early access if this had been released in 2016 or even 2018 when they had released videos of a seemingly functional game i would have said different but 8 years for what we have got here is ridiculous

#####

congratulations people 
you have survived long enough to see the release of this game 
now may you also survive through this coronavirus to play this game for years to come

#####

thank you taleworlds for giving us a chance to play this game before coronavirus wipes us all

#####

i love bannerlord but can not recommend it in its current state when i bought the game on its release i really enjoyed playing it and was excited to see what the devs would do with the game i have now revisited the game though and am fairly disappointed with the progress of its development i am happy that the developers have fine tuned many of the game mechanics and fixed many of its numerous bugs but feel that this is really the only thing that they have completed the devs have still not implemented many vital features such as perks effects currently most perks dont work out of the 12 perk trees that exist 5 of them contain perks whose effects dont work and another 3 have less than 20 of their perks working other missing features include some mechanics regarding sieges kingdom management and crafting there has also been very little in the way of any new armors or weapons which would not be a problem if modding tools were released however mod support has yet to be released and its modding community has subsequently died 

my overall opinion is that the game has been released for 5 ½ months and in that time has made little significant progress in the way of attracting its player base back i would recommend that anybody who is on the fence about purchasing the game wait until mod support drops

edit if anybody wants to see what perks are and arent working check this 
httpswwwbannerlordperkscomperk

also the devs officially announced that the first batch of modding tools is planned for release by the end of august 
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchtime_continue183vncpfjwou7kfeatureemb_logo

2nd edit its september 10th almost a month later and they have not released modding tools yet like i said progress with the games development is disappointing

#####

slight improvement over warband but still lacking many of warbands features and quality of life features crashes often seemingly at random but especially when given warpeace declarations still quite early access seemingly these features arent being worked on and the devs are preferring balance patches over new features
no feasts or events
no claimantsusurpers
no cutscenes
randomly generated companions  jeremus
no promised gangbrigand playstyle
villages dont count as fiefs only useless castles and town do
no upgradable villages
no manhunters
no naval combat
rtr system from warband discarded a clown could become a faction leader overnight
no books or trainers
no hitmens targeting yourandom encounters like the belligerent drunk
no lords consipiring on each others no duels 0 political intrigue
no political quests and denouncement quests
no deserters
no deeper courtships just gamble rng no poems
 very little modding
no camping
lots of other content removeddiscarded
meme ingame economy
meme ingame diplomacy
lots of exploitearly game is a choreboring

#####

highly recommend if you like strat  medieval combat  

single player  super fun just like the old mountblade but better graphics  updates come all the time lots of mods cant wait for the lotr one to be finished lots and lots of potential to an already great base

mutliplayer  offers some pvp but the real gem is captains mode  it is a 6v6 each side is assigned a faction  you get to control a entire unit of troops from that faction as does everyone else  so much fun especially when you slay

overall a  it is still in prerelease so expect a bug or two but it is def playable  have recommended to all of my friends

#####

bear with me this is a doozy and may be the only steam review i ever actually write i had astronomical hopes for this game i played warband religiously for years accumulating hundreds upon hundreds of hours it was my goto and i have many many fond memories from my childhood playing that game its among my alltime favorites i was there when bannerlord was announced i diligently checked for and read new dev diaries i remember when each faction each new mechanic was announced i followed this games development for the entire long slog i remember when the ea was announced to the cheers of its almost harvesting season from the fanbase i was ready to forgive just about any goof or gaff that tale worlds committed all for the chance to play the game that i had waited literally my entire middle schoolhigh schoolmost of college life i didnt buy at first i did not have a good enough computer and i was troubled by some preliminary responses finally i got it ive played it for over one hundred hours now it has so much that i loved from warband and i have had some tremendous fun playing at times

however here i am leaving a negative review i waited eight long years for this game with an additional 10 months or so of ea development and the game is still noticeably unfinished the factions are still atrociously unbalanced plz fix the khuzaits they are still monstrously op even after your 157 beta nerf the companions have taken a large step down even from warband basically sacrificing any semblance of personality in exchange for sheer number of available companions the ai still has no idea how to conduct anything resembling effective diplomacy forgivable in 2010 but 100 inexcusable in the modern era of excellent grand strategy games the technology is absolutely there 

factions declare idiotic wars they could never win and then refuse to make peace even when attacked by multiple factions at once the tribute system is indecipherable there are still potentially campaignending bugs snowballing is still a huge issue and executions are useless because the ai never uses them in my experience and the consequences for the player executing a lord are so steep that you basically have to commit your entire playthrough as a borderline genocide run because your relation with a ton of clans many of them randomass clans from across calradia that should not be batting an eye at this will be irreparably ruined 

the ai certainly has no concept of how to actually fight a battle forcing you to either always have a massive party to outnumber your enemy impossible because of party size limits and the relatively steep influence cost it takes to form and maintain a large army or micromanage the crap out of every soldier you have in real time while also trying to actually have fun and fightnot instantly die theyve gotten rid of almost all passive experience gain so the only way to upgrade troops is by grinding out boring battles with looters who as a further slap in the face seem to always kill exactly one of your top tier troops in the process because the battle simulation sucks ass and because top tier noble troops are so hard to find in the first place let alone upgrade for the reasons previously listed i hope you enjoyed having that elite cataphract for all of two days they havent even implemented all the perks for the skill tree yet after all this time 

i say all this to say that im very disappointed even frustrated with how this game was developed so far i dont mean this to be personal because i know that tale worlds has to their massive credit been working hard at patching out bugs and rebalancing things as best as they can when they could have just taken the money and run im just left scratching my head wondering why this game the one we have currently took so long based on whats there

take this review as more of a caution against the ea game in its current state let me be clear the bones for a tremendous game are there i promise like i said i did have plenty of fun with this game despite its issues ive just reached a point at which i can no longer ignore them and they are a bit too glaring for me to continue having fun with this game for the time being ill be taking a break for a while for those of you considering buying at this point wait watch for hotfixes patches and updates read the forums and see how things seem to be progressing hold off until this games reaches its full release at the very least devs you havent lost me yet but my trust in you has been strained please please iron things out and i will be back to dumping my hours into this game like im a 12 year old playing warband again i will promptly delete or otherwise edit this review when that time comes

for now i will sit tight harvesting season eludes me still

i edited my review to get the steam autumn sale badge

1010 tho fo sure

h1building on the broken design premise of the originalh1

bannerlord has been in early access for almost two years and while the game is more stable the fundamental design problems remain considering the 8 year timeline to get from mb1 to this sequel its safe to say that this will not be solved

tldr  if you enjoy a casual battle simulator in a very surface level early medieval world youll have fun fighting bandits and shooting bows things start to collapse at the midgame however

bannerlord was supposed to take the nugget of good ideas and battle simulation and give it depth life and dynamism none of these things have happened with that said the main problems i have with this game which really just exposes the fundamentally broken core design philosophy that was already showing with the first game

list
 diplomacy relationships and dialogue have no depth the systems arent even shallow theyre barely functional there is never any dialogue and no complexity to diplomacy as an example if i execute a cruel enemy lord who our faction is always at war with who is always raiding our border villages i get a 100 relations hit to the acrosstheworld faction that also hated that faction but didnt know the person i executed complete and total nonsense everything is halfbaked executions werent frequent but they did happen and this game refuses to identify how to make that work in a sensible way

 recruitment troop management and the lack of impact in war  its war all the time with doomstacks of armies that immediately teleport to you when youre sieging their fief or that replenish in a couple days there are claims they just pull from their garrisons and thats why its quick but meanwhile their garrisons dont drop either adversity is what can make this game thrilling but the same adversity over and over again in a way that very clearly breaks immersion is just boring and frustrating all games will have hidden systems to keep the ai competitive but they need to be inconspicuous and make sense within the games design logic bannerlord does not do this at all

 the economy is rudimentary valuations are out of whack and workshopstradingeconomic simulations you can participate in as the player have no depth again halfbaked

 there are also some serious problems in the combat simulator too  have you seen how cavalry mob and then can barely swing their swords or maces as they circle a few footmen and float around the map because of all the poorly defined physics collisions of their movements

 battlefield reinforcement no tactics no strategy etc basically take any of the total war style battlefield design philosophies for prebattle deployment and manoeuvring that would make sense in a battle game of this style and literally none of them exist there are limited troop command controls for your character on the battlefield but this quickly falls apart at larger battle scales 100 vs 100 or greater especially when reinforcements come into play

 kingdom dynamics are problematic and surface level  you build up influence in order to vote on actions or take your own but there is no real intrigue to be had  any of the mechanics you might expect for a kingdomnoblesclan simulator looking at you ck3 that could apply here do not exist

 tech stackwise the game has serious engine limitations i suspect the issues with the ai behaviour on world map and battle map physics and scripting for relationships events and kingdom actions is restricted by the engine they use theyre too far into it now to make any changes

 there are more observations i could make as i keep seeing new examples every time i try a runthrough but ill leave it there
list

if youre just wanting a fun battle simulator go for it for anything sandbox or story mode though give it a pass youll be left teased and denied and not in a fun way

#####

devs announced their 10 full release out of nowhere without completing the new features to actually differentiate and modernize this game from mount and blade warband no features are meaningfully changed for this game  it is just a new map and nicer to look at

fuck you

#####

bannerlord was estimated to be in early access for 1 year were now approaching the 2nd year mark of early access bannerlord is not bad game or one that i wouldnt recommend the devs on the other hand have entirely lost sight of the project the devs think they are some kind of super mega company super stars that can just ignore their fans the siege ai has been broken for fucking ages and the devs havent even bothered to acknowledge the problem exists instead they put out much more meaningful updates such being able to raise your fist in mp now im sure all 2 people that are still active in mp liked that update since the start of the game the devs have been adding new towns cities and castles which do look very good but what is the point if the game is so shallow there is literally no point in going to these places hey look guys the devs have added 2 new taverns for dickburg and pisstadia along with bug fixes in a 9 gb update how many times will you actually go to these taverns never there is no point in exploring anywhere in this game npcs just repeat the exact same 3 lines your dialogue choices dont matter its actually laughable if you order a drink from a waitress through dialogue nothing even happens she just walks away but oooo you can play the exact same boardgame in every tavern such an immersive experience indeed 

the devs think they can turn this game into an esport well to that i need to remind them that esports needs not only an audience but also players which bannerlord multiplayer has neither the drive of mount and blade has always been the singleplayer and its sandbox do whatever you want experience not multiplayer which the devs pile more and more resources into while singleplayer sits there a shallow repetitive broken bore now back when i mentioned the length of this game being in early access it wouldnt be a big deal that the game stayed in early access longer than intended delays happen and with covid keeping that efficiency would no doubt be hard the problem that i have with the devs keeping the game in early access is because the updates they put out are so fucking empty at the rate of progression maybe if you revisit this game in 3 years it may just about be ready to leave early access they dont even have banners in the game called fucking bannerlord yet 

taleworlds you dont need to put out a new update every single time you add 1 tiny fucking thing save those features and cobble them together with massive game changing updates to make it actually exciting no one is going to get back into the game because i can now upgrade my party members to lords nobody gives a fuck about that on its own or any of the other shite minor feature you add devs really need to get their finger out their ass and actually work on their game and allocate their resources back into singleplayer i love the game but my patience with the devs since release has been tested time and time again 50 for this is just a joke

#####

im really enjoying this game only bad things i have to say about it at this time is the performance i get a ton of frame rate loss

#####

its not finished but its still great battles are epic

#####

why the pretty lady not want to marry me

#####

the only game in which i have more than 250 hours and no achievements 

#####

9 homeless men chased down my army to throw stones at my general 

#####

its alright i play it here and there should probably try some mods

#####

after i had successfully taken a castle a lord refused to nominate me for it so i changed sides found his wife and cut off her head 1010



i adore it in general watch the patch notes add it to your wishlist and check it out when it goes on sale if you dont want to spend the 40 or 50 on it just yet you can make it as difficult or as simple as you like very relaxed and intense all at once

the main game has a nice sense of refinement and satisfaction combat is fantastic difficult and somewhat superior to warband the potential is enormous but without mods it can get dull after awhile and it can be tiresome to continuously update mods whenever a new beta is released 

overall 1010 game would recommend

#####

what it does better than warband

graphics
tournaments
cities
battle size
combat
settlement upgrades
trade
player leveling

what it does worse than warband

diplomacy
courting
lacks right to rule
workshops

overall 910


#####

bannerlord is a great port from warband except its nothing more than that
 campaign still unfinished
 diplomacy is almost inexistent
 economy is a joke
 your settlements towns castles will never really evolve
 villages dont count as fiefs and cant be upgraded
 warbands rtr system discarded
 no custom banner except through mods
 no coop and it was a promise on the roadmap
 most roadmap goals were erased to oblivion
 no boats
 no feast
 no deserters
 no camping
 sieges are barely fixed
 no claimantsusurpers
 no court
 no books nor trainers
 randomly generated companions jeremiah we shall not forget you
 no endgame
 devs counting on modders to fix their game

i love mb i have spent more hours in warband than in any game whatsoever so i cant forgive tw for their laziness over the past ten years of development
ten fugging years

from the announcement of the game till its release
 ubisoft has released 8 assassins creed games
 skyrim has been released 6 times

 americans elected a bag of cheetos as president
 we survived a major pandemic
 wokeness rose and ruined everything for everyone
 star citizen is still in early access
 valve released a game

its an awful unfinished mess and im really sad because i love this series and i expected something better than what we got

modders its up to you again 

edit 121223  as i thought tw doesnt do jackshit the 120 update still hasnt been released despite promises and claims and modders did have to fix and develop content in their stead

update 2022 december 12
again the game has improved a lot its much more stable now the skillperk system has been fully implemented barely ever crashes
it still seems a bit empty in terms of there really being very few gameplay options for you gather armies wage war repeat but its alright
sieges are also much better now the ai seems to find its way to where the ladders are and generally behaves a bit more like expected


update 2021 july 14
the game has improved a lot over the past year most notably for me at least
 much quicker load times especially between different scenes
 better fps and fps stability
 significantly reduced bugs
 the addition of a few fetch or go there kill that quests

however the game still lacks a lot of substance once you get into the mid game your gameplay goes into a cycle of
war  go pickoff enemy lords one by one make money from selling loot and ransoming there or assemble an army and go siege a town
peace  ride around looking for war horses and levelling your troops
rinse and repeat
siege ai is still incredibly stupid i cant emphasize this enough its just nonexistent really if youre trying to join a siege with other lords they will just send their troops to scale the walls then recall them and then just leave them to stand in the middle of the field getting blasted by mangonels so much potential fun with sieges but completely wasted on absolutely retarded nonexistent ai

im really hoping the gameplay will be expanded further down the line original review below
__________
to quote the devs we dont believe in releasing a game before it is ready just because we might miss the hype oh the irony some bulletpoints

     there is very little to do in the game apart from the basic acquire troops train them fight go acquire more troops repeat theres not much else left of substance
     the skill tree  perks are broken or just plain not implemented
     quests are absolute rubbish heres a taster deliver cattle from this town to the next follow a caravan around go to the next village and talk to an npc zero creativity went into making these quests
     companions are dull and uninspiring theres very little you can do with them some things you can use them for are 1 as an extra soldier 2 as a party leader the latter one is pretty cool you can set them up to basically become like the other lord npcs meaning the companion will wander around the map gather and train troops engage bandits and enemy factions unfortunately they will be captured sooner rather than later then you a lord of 2 cities and 3 castles will have to journey across the land just to fetch the failed party leader from a bldy tavern you can also set them up to lead caravans which have the potential to make you extra money but thats it they get captured too easily that way and you lose the initial investment you paid to set up the caravan
     sieges play out like a game with the bots set on the lowest difficulty the ai clearly struggles with pathfinding and has very rudimentary assault ai basically they will get stuck on ladders at the bottoms of ladders in front of the gate on top of the ladder although i do expect this will be sorted out
     theres close to zero interaction options with other npcs  you can play some minigames with them board games ask them about a previous war theyll give a short story about it nothing too interesting ask them about the current situation they will give a very generic reply or try to barter with them with a few exceptions thats pretty much it
     theres close to zero diplomacy apart from warspeace if you do make peace with a faction that faction will likely declare war on you a few days later
there is a feudal council system where lords in a faction can vote to pass certain laws which is a cool feature and does seem to work relatively well
     so many broken mechanics i cant be bothered to list them all 
but perhaps my worst experience in terms of gameplay was in relation to enemy ai lords fixated on raiding my villages the situation was one where at the start of the war an enemy lord started looting one of my villages i quickly defeated and imprisoned this lord only to see 2 more enemy parties coming to raid the same village i made little work of them as well capturing the lords not a day has passed and i defeated a couple of more lords at which point the first lord has escaped a couple of days go by i now have maybe 8 lords as prisoners in my party and what do i see the first lord whom i defeated is back with a new army the other captured lords also eventually escape regardless of whether i hold them in my party or put them in a dungeon and i end up in an endless cycle of defeating capturing lords them escaping and returning with new armies ridiculously frustrating

overall i just cannot express enough the utter disappointment i have with the game i do not see where the developer time went allegedly the game was in development for many years i remember seeing playable demos back in what 2017 the game was announced way back in 2012 now were in 2020 and they decided to go for the money grab i refer your to the quote from the devs at the top of the review and release the game as early access 

to be fair at first it seemed quite alright in the first half of april 2020 we were getting pretty substantial updates every day ironing out bugs and adding small bits to the game but then they decided to switch to a larger weekly update schedule as of writing this review may 31st weve had exactly 4 larger weekly updates with the latest being dated may 15th this week the update included fixes for 4 or 5 instances of game crashes basically a micropatch 
at these rates i am no longer hopeful to see a full release of the game 

in summary the game in its current state just feels empty lifeless contrary to what others have noted there is actually very little to do the grind feels alright at the beginning when youre building your skills and acquiring equipment and troops but it gets old really fast you can as i did start the game from zero at that point but really after your 5th restart you cant be bothered anymore

the game is on sale at full retail price and is available to anyone at this point hiding behind the early access designation is just cynical in my opinion

my recommendation do not buy the game its not worth it in its current state wait for the game to be officially released and read the reviews then

#####

this game is the perfect followup for anyone who loved warband or the original mount  blade its still in early access but i think if you like me have borderline exhausted warband this is the next step although it is a lot more complicated than its predecessors and the game does introduce you to its new systems fairly well there are some things you should be made aware of before you start

1 the entire game revolves around a clan mechanic no longer are you a starting adventurer with nothing and no one now you have a clan you rise and fall with your clan when you die yes you can die you take over as someone else from your clan there is now an actual reason for getting married but the clan system can take away some of the fun of warband where it was just you starting the game you have several siblings whose lives you are in charge of and because of this it can feel micromanagy at times clan tiers are a thing and the game locks you out of some of the more fun aspects of warband like starting your own kingdom until you hit a certain clan tier so just bear with it

2 the whole trade system is weird in warband to become a merchant you just had to buy and sell goods and open an enterprise here you can make caravans for yourself and buy multiple workshops right now theyre pretty nerfed so check out the mod community

3 kingdom management is a lot more complicated whether you are a vassal or a monarch theres a lot going on so dont feel bad for looking things up or pausing the game just to read through the kingdom screen press k this isnt crusader kings but it can still be overwhelming

4 mods work with native unlike in warband for the most part mods here affect your native gameplay and some work with new updates and some dont i recommend playing the game for about thirty hours without mods then adding a few in but like any elder scrolls veteran can tell you try adding one at a time in case it starts crashing your game

5 years pass quickly ive had warband playthroughs where i conquer calradia in about a year and a half here its much different years pass quick and youll still probably be doing the first two missions by the end of year two on your first playthrough

6 there is a story kind of like skyrim the game locks you out of the fun stuff until you do the early story quests and one of them can be a nightmare feel free to look up guides because at this point most of the mods to help you with it do not work with the current update written october 26 2021 there is a point to the story it explains why the world is the way it is but i dont blame you for just doing sandbox after your third or fourth start

7 the game is early access things change all the time things are buffed and nerfed like no other dont be discouraged the modding community is great and there are a ton of things to help right now workshops are dead in the water but there are mods to make them not be a bane when they should be a boon please dont feel weird or bad for using cheats after you have to restart because an update killed your perfect playthrough or youre using an op mod because youre last character was almost king of all calradia but now because youre a sturgian youre getting culture penalties everywhere just dont sweat it

overall this is one of the most fun games ive ever played and it is a true sequel to the original games if you think you can live with the early access features pick it up if not just wait and if youve never played a mount  blade game before i would recommend either starting here or warband warband might be a more consistent experience but if it doesnt hook you pick this game up on the cheap

#####

should you try mount  blade 2 bannerlord 
its a big maybe 
hang on a second dude you have 160 hours on the clock you might say but that was actually just to try something and its the whole reason why it is a maybe 160 hours of gameplay for a 50 title is definitely okay but this title is falling short in a lot of areas and i dont think the finished game will be able to change that
let me explain

i tried to capture the entire world map which i honestly can only recommend if you want to see what this game is not good at
 getting clans onboard this is luckbased and you can only persuade existing clans to switch sides with a good chunk of luck and a lot of gold involved 25 million to switch to you is no rare sight even when you are ruling the vastly bigger kingdom no one will ever voluntarily switch over if you crushed one kingdom the clans will simply move over to different kingdoms  but never ever your own 

 managing your clans simply not possible they do what they want are are mostly incompetent breaking off sieges in the middle not trying to protect villages and forming armies on one side of the map trying to get all the way over to the other side which does not work because the army will run out of cohesion 

 marriage and inheritance gives you virtually nothing as far as i could tell there is simply no system whatsoever that would give you any rights to titles or anything in fact something as rights and titles isnt even in the game its just an attribute the game selects for the ruling dude and if he dies it randomly hops over to someone else in many cases even from a different clan 

 battles great fun and all in the first few rounds with smaller armies of like 50 vs 50 once you go into the 300s both sides combined you will find many battlefields are simply too small the enemy ai is also mostly trying to avoid fighting by going hard left or right from their spawn position where you have to lure them out since there can only be 400 soldiers on the battlefield at any given point enemies will simply spawn in as you are defeating them especially in battles against larger armies so you and your men made it to the enemies that just waited near their spawn point you overwhelm them just to get more enemies spawned right in the middle of your troops causing huge casualties this is just a really bad system especially if have to fight wave after wave of these spawns tiresome and not fun 

 battle simulations basically random results even if you have 150 men vs 26 looters chances are they kill one of yours especially very high level units like battarian heroes or elite cataphracts this just does not make sense if you play the battle personally they are not even getting near your units before bailing and yet in a simulation they kill one of the best units the simulation also does not scale if you have very large armies 600 against similar sized armies you suddenly get away with just 8 casualties if you try a 200 vs 200 the results look quite different its just very unpredictable and intransparent i always avoided simulations for the majority of fights to avoid loosing good units 

 sieges it really is funny that the video on this shop page from 2016 shows a lot more features than are actually functioning in the game sieges are boring and messy if you use ladders siege towers or you breached the enemy walls does not matter much in most cases you will still have to run up against a shield wall that you can easily run around and slaughter the enemy from behind there are no really strategic options that would make it interesting or challenging the only challenge you can have is going up against 400 men with just 50 also the enemies spawn directly in the courtyard in front of the gate which is great if that is where your men are currently fighting the spawning is just daft 

 wars essentially the other kingdoms will constantly spam you with war declarations as there is no grants titles or rights implemented in this game there is no visible reason as to why this happens at some point you are at war with basically everyone further exposing the completely incompetent own clan ai since villages create an endless supply of soldiers those wars never end and you end up fighting an army against the very same guys you just had let go after a fight over and over and over again such fun

 own parties as the leader of your clan you can create parties that you can also call to your army at any time for free
sadly those parties are constantly being wiped out and do not recreate themselves it has to be done manually while the enemy ai immediately sends out beaten heroes again to recruit from the endless peasant supply and go to battle again 

 trading yes possible but you cannot achieve anything with it aside from getting rich you cannot buy titles or castles or land or anything since such system are simply not implemented and not even hinted at
you can create caravans but much like your own parties they constantly get wiped out and not replaced its just another hassle to deal with for very little benefit 

 crime every city has a crime lord or two but in the end they are completely meaningless being on the bad side of the law is meaningless too even when you are on the good side you are constantly in wars with everyone so the reason why you fight comes down to your own roleplaying if you are into that sort of thing being an outlaw has no benefits special mechanics or anything just everyone hates you but that will happen eventually anyway
economy since the wars are neverending in this game the economy suffers greatly the ai will just go from city to city and buy all the food that is there completely stripping it empty stationed garrisons will then desert since there is no food for them left its just a completely unmoderated system much like the endless peasants 

so all in all i hope this gave you an insight the tldr of this is this game would need at least 5 years of early access to put all the required systems in place to make this a diverse playing experience the novelty of playing those battles wears of quite quickly and there really is not much else in this game any kind of systems to manage your clan or kingdom the economy diplomacy its all not existing the modcommunity is trying to help out and they have created fantastic mods but it shouldnt be their job to fill those huge gaps this game has been out for an entire year now but is missing so much i dont have any hopes of the things i described ever to become a reality since their predecessors were not particulary good at those either and none of what is missing is even really hinted at if there is a roadmap its a star citizenlike one no thanks

#####

let me start by saying that i love this game series
but until the full release i would not recommend buying this game
it has come a long way since its release but there are still too many things that need smoothing out or reworking 
some updates break stuff that worked before or the turn of one cog effected other cogs and lead to new problems arising hence my advice to wait for the full game

i guess i would not have come even close to 400 hours played without mods i cannot imagine playing this game vanilla mods are what keep me coming back since you can modify the game to your liking and luckily there have been a plethora of mods since release but this leads to the next problem the regular updates break mods and many great mod creators have had enough of regularly updating their mods to everchanging parameters always depending on which part of the game the update affected and have stopped supporting their mods more than once i reinstalled the game to give it another go just to find out that an important mod is currently not working now you get to choose between waiting for an update or try without maybe missing out on features you find absolutely necessary

currently there are many gameplay elements that feel unfinished or badly planned ai for example is nonexistent unless you are leading your own kingdom you are in for a lot of pain there is enough pain when being king just a tad more control on your part lords breaking a siege instead of attacking suddenly wanting to cross the continent to visit a city or start sieging some castle preferably the one furthest away from your current position or hey youre in a war with 2 factions stronger than you lets have some lords with too much influence initiate a vote on declaring war on another faction
when youre king youre at least able to veto votes by investing a fortune of influence as to not have 4 concurrent wars and you always get to lead an army since you have most influence if you havent just sunk over 1400 influence into saying no to some stupid law or war a lord wanted to start and its never only one proposal youll have some downtime and then bam here are 4 brainless proposals for your kingdom
and even then the other ai armies are completely brainless not running from a siege if a bigger army arrives and getting smashed but you can bet theyll lift a siege to defend a castle halfway across the map
and the ai cheats oh it cheats 
let me show this with a generic example you siege city army comes to defend smash it release 1 or 2 lords to increase opinion as to maybe poach them in the future before even being able to finish building one ram or siege tower another full stack army with the same lords appears and attacks again how fun
after being at war for a while in comes the next fun part
the calculation of tribute when proposing peace seems so broken i cannot make sense of it having 95 of lords as prisoners and having conquered several settlements and having inflicted much more casualties leads tome paying them
ai kingdoms youre a part of especially enjoy taking unfavourable peace deals as the winner and if youre king most likely your lords wont want to end their fun which leads to even more invested influence

gameplay wise my biggest gripe is how grindy this game is starting a new game is cool for the first 2 times but after a while and having regular savebreaking updates i dont want to fight a hundred looter bands or tournaments just to be able to be a mercenary or at clan lvl 2 join a kingdom as a vassal and the fun does not end there reaching clan level 4 or 5 is another level of grindy even with mods that slightly increase gains as to not have to grind that hard my kingdom almost controls all of the starting empire lands and i just reached clan level 4 so my guess is i will reach lvl 5 once i control all of calradia 
i get the approach to be a slow game but there is not too much to do beside warring its more of an empty grind during peace you travel from fief to fief to see if another building can be put into the queue replenish your army to capacity and do the same quests for the 100th time and having to fight 40 battles during one war which sadly gets old really quick once you figure out how the ai fights smashing army after army just for a new one to spring forth does not feel rewarding all the while your own numbers dwindle and you gotta slowly crawl from settlement to settlement to hire between 39 new men the ai just spawns fresh with new troops ready to band together again and get another go at you
some updates even implemented certain changes to things that were too quick or strong while some things have been broken since release workshops in vanilla the only good passive income beside city taxes have been nerfed so hard you cannot afford more than 100 men without having several fiefs with a garrison that can defend said fiefs without mods this is just tedious
i get that theres a lot of work to be done and some things are easier to fix than others but it just is not cool from a players pov
for everything that is really great about this game there is something very tedious to hamper your fun

wait till full release and maybe even wait a little then so the mod creators can update their stuff for full enjoyment of the game

just to show you a small list of addons i cannot play without
kaoses tweaks the single most important mod you can tweak so many small things like influence and fame gain or how many followers and parties you can use
 diplomacy since there is hardly any implementation of several functions that seem so very basic for a game such as this
 improved garrison so i have a small level of control over my settlements defenses
 cultured start so i do not always have to start as a peasant and grind my way up for over a week many interesting start options i personally prefer noble in exile where you start with clan lvl 2 while being hated in you origin culture at the start
fill stacks removes the cheat units lords get when respawning making battles more impactful since the ai cannot just cheat half full armies into existence and has to slowly collect troops like me
 distinguished service once your kingdom is somewhat grown to the size of other kingdoms you have too few clans nobles and governors to effectively rule your lands hence this little helper that increases companion size for your clan and lets me promote successful soldiers after battles to make them into governors or party leaders

#####

an example of two characters i have played recently 

thor odinson
i spent quite some time making thor odinson had him looking the part and all the right stats start the game and we get to our first settlement i was in desperate need of some soldiers to help me traverse the map to being some trade runs as settlement one hand no units i set off for a village just next to me a small band of looters 4 of them stop me and ask for my money or my life or words to that effect hah i said i am thor and attacked so anyway that was that and thor god of thunder son of odin was dead from a blow from the almighty weapon known as a stone thrown by some pleb in a rag

ok so

meet bob 
i spent no time at all making bob as i was a little disheartened about poor old thor #ing god of blablabla who died to a pebble 
bob survived his first day and created a small 20 soldier party this let him trade and build his party into a party of 1 scout 1 surgeon 1 captain and 40 ish soldiers
bob was offered a mercenary contract which he took so now bob was working as a merc with 40 soldiers and several companions
after a year a #ing year  bob became a vassal to the king of the kingdom he was doing merc work for
he was granted a castle after an epic battle to take the castle from the toga wearing bath loving freaks of the empire 
bob buys a bride as in the daughter of the king for 50000 and  well
the toga loving bath taking freaks attacked my castle won took me and my bride prisoner i dont like to think about what they did to her god forbid maybe they made her take a bath 
i escaped 
she didnt 
i tried a valiant
it failed 
and so ended the story of bob at the hands of some random enemy with a sword


this game is using a system i have wanted in games i play like elite dangerous and many other games
it has the option to be iron man so no save scum and it has a built in births and deaths option

the births and deaths option is brilliant and i have been wanting something like it for a long time
if you die without an heir its game over and you have to restart  
if you live to a rip old age your gona die of old age

doing this on iron man and adding a small mod that makes combat deaths for the player and npcs be the same is perfect  the devs should add this as an extra hardcore option

fantastic game with what looks like many hours of game play for me that means 1000 at least

so yer its a great game and worth buying


#####

great game worth the price when on offer the main problems it has right now is the lack of meaningful interactions and also  the fact that if you are a vassal and start a siege if an army comes along to help within the siege they take control of it and then it becomes a 5050 coin flip on if a siege starts or they wait for you to leave before doing so

#####

the only early access game i have ever allowed to tease me with its promises of greatness and unfulfilled potential for the notinsignificant price of 50 dollars 

alternatively as described to a friend
as long as they dont bastardize any of my placeholder spouses i will tolerate this game



update i give up the development team clearly lacks direction in nearly every conceivable aspect andor severely deviates from what originally felt like a more coherent vision the current teams biggest achilles heel is its own incompetence when they attempt to add new features or fine tune a previously existing featureusually something that clearly had more complex coding but maybe needed tweakingit tends to backfire severely and cheapens the entire experience and that applies to everything from gameplay to artistic direction which as a visual artist especially irritates me there are far more competent programers and designers in the modding community but taleworlds appears to constantly be shafting their betters obviously the potential in the game is there but potential alone will not carry a game like this


some quick takes
olist
is it remotely close to completion no
is it worth your 50 bucks in its current state and probably its continued state for at least another 3 years or so no
would i recommend it to casual players that have no experience with the mountblade series in general no there is not enough depth in the core gameplay asis or polish to justify a price that is more in line with a finished product
warband is absolutely the better game in terms of depth and scope but i definitely feel anyone out there who might want that gameplay in a shiny nicerlooking package spoilers thats not what youll get not for a long while
olist


there are lots of pretty dope things i like about bl which are mostly minor easily overlooked things outside of the core gameplay including
list
pretty interesting lorebackstory that you can explore as part of the main quest with differing perspectives from different lords within the same faction and even how relationships with rulers are reflected in nobles voting decisions how there are actually deceased characters present with some having been murdered by rival nations
if youre a huge tool like me investigating the stated relationships between the og lordsladies in the game code is actually funespecially how certain characters were intended to beas is seeing where new people have been added with patches how existing lords have been changed vlandian varmund is hilariously described as stunningly ugly which is awesome
the legit direct future ancestors of the khergits and sarranids are here towns from wb are still identifiable by name which blew my tiny mind when i recognized them never saw any prerelease stuff so i presume i got to enjoy the full o experience lol and is such a sick connection to wb
the little things that differentiate each nation like how each factions taverns actually have local dishes that reflect the factions culture nationspecific gear the overall scene design between nations etc
the mocapped animations i know im easily impressed but man when dudes grab their throat when i shoot them in the neck or grab their backside when i shoot them in the butt thats pretty sicknot to mention the interactions between npcs like seeing a soldier seemingly dozing off during a lecture by another soldier and getting jolted awake or npcs clapping and doing that whole eyyy look at this guy playin dis instrument wouldja lookit that animation around tavern musicians
the aging mechanic is probably one of the things that impressed me the most especially in my 17year playthrough where i watched people who started out as teens age into adults and watched the adults become elderly over time its just a very cool way of seeing time progress beyond watching territories come and go as you play
list

the details where they exist in this game are impressive there was clearly a lot of effort invested into building this world which is greatly appreciated and helps immerse you in the game unfortunately thats where the praise stops as bl is the kind of game where its left hand has no fing idea what its right hand is doing and it will become apparent to you the longer you hang on there just feels like a huge lack of quality control and project management here and taleworlds has apparently never heard of the saying if it aint broke dont fix it

that said heres an incomplete list of things that have become super offputting to me at this point with the glaringly obvious things like perks ai problems blah blah blah and whatnot being left out
list
high school students can fix more typos for an essay in a day than taleworlds can fix in their dialoguedialogue triggers over the span of a year
unintentionally funny writing i laughed like a donkey when my npc brother hit me with damn sister i love you sister after being rescued
from june 2020 the devs adding 100s of new marriageable women so theres like a 31 ratio of women you can marry vs men and you can legit tell who these new npcs are because the vast majority of them have freaka mutant facessameface syndrome compared to existing ladies who feel like they had effort put into their appearances seriously some of the new women have weird greenyellow overlays on the skin and blue lips like theyre simultaneously experiencing jaundice and drowning which is medieval af i guess
all of the above apparently not being placeholders but an actual artistic decision which is now being applied to existing characters that not only looked better but actually felt like they told a story with their appearances ie sturgian lord olek used to look like a weary fierce warlord but now looks like what i can only describe as a bloated squinty potato oleks sister siga formerly being an older badasslooking humorless honorobsessed shieldmaiden suddenly getting the sephora treatment complete with hair extensions penton neretzes going from an older dignifiedlooking imperial blowhard to i dont even know what the hell is wrong with him and god knows what other bastardizations im not including
nationscultures formerly having specific traits for their appearances like the battanians being stout tough redheads the vlandians being a mix of brunettes and varieties of blonde with the occasional redhead which i actually thought was cool like a noble having battanian blood somewhere which wouldnt be too crazy given vlandia and battania share a border the sturgians being tall beefy very fair skinned and fairhaired the imperials kind of being a grab bag of traits which ties in with them conquering other people a la the roman empire etc no longer being a thing is actually a bummer
a pet peeve that only i probably am driven insane by where nobles formerly had a relatively unique set of clothing that distinguished them as nobles ie vlandians had the 2 variants of their crowned helms a helmet with plated sideguards their civilian scholar robes etc they now have equipment that makes a lot of them look more like an average soldier vlandian lords getting kettlehats and imperial shoulder guards eh
list

i genuinely hate some of these changes so much ive gone back game versions just to grab some of the files from back then to implant them in the latest version of the game including textures and im legit blown away by how much better certain things were back then thats i50 goddamn gbi total going back and forth

tldr this igamei man worse relationship ive ever had i keep coming back like its going to be different next time i keep putting time in it thinking man its gonna be better this time i cant hold on forever

#####

potential is massive but without mods it gets boring and constantly updating mods every time new beta comes out is tedious want for full release and mod support

#####

fun but needs better mod support

#####

before i played this i had a small penis no girlfriend and no will to live none of these things have changed but the game is pretty good

#####

ive spent thousands of hours playing pc games  frankly its embarrassing
i probably could have built a house or something with all that time

so after 20 years playing games this is my first steam review  

why

because even someone as lazy as me has to stop give this game a thumbs up  

its got some glitches and oddities but the dev team is all over it with constant improvements to the game as it comes through early access  it has beautiful graphics good physicsdynamics and engaging content i have played through a ton of rpg open world type games as well as the entire mount and blade series and easily put this near the top of the list

even at this stage v157 it has a ton of depthi am sixty something hours deep and have quite happily barely moved along the main quests as i build out my character and his army  

battlefighting takes time to master but is extremely fun and the campaign map is pretty and true to mb style 

it can be a bit of a grind for cash early in the game thats about my only complaint of any significance  its a well executed game

1010 











#####

how the fuck is this full release its not even done lol

#####

swiftly thrust in to this hostile world i found myself with a retinue of eight eight loyal yet untrained men that slogged on foot as i traversed the land atop an old workhorse unaligned to any house or lord we made our coin in the local villages settling family feuds escorting cattle from village to village and in a few extreme circumstances taking up arms with the pissants to repel marauding bands of deserters it wasnt long before more fighting men joined my flock 

over the weeks we collected weapons armour and fame a capable retinue of forty both militia armed with spear sword and axe as well as archers and skirmishers alas not capable enough accosted by a larger group not mere looters but the dreaded bandits of the forest eagleeyed archers skilled in their craft out numbered we were picked off from afar my loyal retinue dropping on the flanks as their shields could protect them no longer arrows burst what little armour protected them and claimed their lives before we could even see the foe my own horse was claimed i fell

next came the charge we met our foe with even less men now we fought hard and bloodied our blades but it wasnt enough soon enough i looked around me to realise that my men were dead and dying one was even fleeing the battlefield it was too late for me surrounded and bloodied i was beaten captured and dragged across the unforgiving wilderness a slave to be pawned or worked to an early grave 

i would recommend this experience just avoid the dreaded forest bandits

#####

is it all we hoped for no
is it still really fun yes

the first few weeks well lets not speak of those the game in its current state is enjoyable mods fix many issues and the single player experience is solid some perks dont work balancing still needs to be perfected and yet i have sunken more hours into this game than any other in a long time

910  needs more looters jk

#####

remember when your army took me as prisoner and extorted me of my coin then i proceeded to execute every lord of your kingdom until you were the last one standing whats that oh its your head rolling

#####

this game is good and enjoyable to play however please fix the ai pathfinding for sieges the ai just dont know how to use ladders and siege equipment to breach the walls they also cant figure out to rush the main gate when it is down causing heavy losses on your side when there shouldnt have been super frustrating to lose 300 men because you men cant get up ladders fast enough or at all to help support the fight please fix this problem i know you can do it

edit i have learnt that you can go into tab at top of page which says community hub then go to tab workshop inside the workshop you can select mods to enable in game mobs can and do fix all problems game has as well as hundreds which completely overhaul it i know this was always bannerlords intent but i found it difficult to get mods working

bannerlord is excellent

it cannot be beaten through honourable conquest
only way is to execute every single lord you beat
once you reach a certain size you must pay huge tributes even if you are stronger killed more troops and took more towns so when you have all the leverage you must pay everyone else huge sums of coin which means you cannot win
is big thumbs down beacsue i have never been able to take a character to the end my army gets kd ratio of like 1001 but cannot win because you need to pay out thousands each day to tiny nations who have zero leverage reason i stop playing this blasted game over and over
just let players bloody win if i have all the armies economy and will then i have the leverage not the stupid teams with 5 of what i have
please fix

so warband is probably my all time favorite game and so it is with a pretty heavy heart i write this review ultimately bannerlord has the basis for a good game but not only is the game unfinished and unbalanced its chopped full of cool features executed so horribly itd be better off without them its also worth noting part of what prompted me not reccomending is the rate at which patches come out currently they seem to be focusing on fixing crashes which with as much in the game doesnt work and hasnt for years seems kind of ridiculous to focus on below are a list of major issues within the game ill do my best to remove them if they get fixed

siege ai so ill start with the battlefield ai its been almost 2 years and we dont have a ai that climbs ladders something necessary to win siege assaults im not kidding i defended a castle with 400 against over 2000 and won without losing more than 100 soldiers simply because the ai cant climb ladders even worse if you bust the gate your soldiers will actively ignore the breached gate for siege towersladders they blatantly dont know how to use so 2 years after release sieges are essentially broken unless controlled by the player ya know something absolutely integral to the game

siege extended also on the strategic map instead of being a resonable human being building your equipment en masse and sending it up the second a ranged engine is built it engages the castle meaning you will pretty much never have 4 onagers as the offence in fact the only purpose of ranged engines is to either get 1 to assist you in an assault or to spam trebuchets to breach the wall so you can just tell your soldiers to charge and them actually do it competently

strategic ai the strategic ai is at least workable but actively uses a us vs player mentality which once again sucks the fun out of the game lets start with theres no non aggressions pacts alliances ext which the game desparately needs the ai will actively gang up on the player in 3 vs 1 scenarios and if the player declares war on someone who is already at war they will instantly get peace and both declare war on player if the ai ganging up one you is not bad enough your own lords will attempt to start wars while you are in multiple conflicts as is this is a major problem because is means you either throw away massive amounts of influence to keep peace or let your lords drive your nation into the ground with suicidal diplomacy furthermore if all this wasnt enough what is peace really worth its not uncommon for factions to declare war less than a week after peace is achieved making the whole tribute system pointless on a side note the ai is absolutely tunnel visioned it will do whatever it takes to achieve whatever petty objective it sets it mind to i had the ai forming multiple 1000 man armies to raid a singular village i ended up killing over 5000 soldiers before they ultimately raided the village there was a point where i was waiting in it and there were at least a half dozen lords just circling around the village waiting for me to leave this is just 1 small example of how the ais tunnel vision breaks immersion where it becomes blatantly obvious the ai is more interested in harassing the player than acting like a actual lord

mercenaries mercenaries are another should be cool feature that is executed so poorly it ruins the game there are 14 mercenary clans in the game each with 4 lords each meaning 56 lords in total during wars nations can recruit these clans for a sum of money based on performance during the conflict the problem is as a player you must hunt down the mercenary leader and he cant be hired by another nation at that time to recruit them which you almost never have time to do during a war even worse he is on a timer you dont know about and will auto defect to another nation and be unretrievable at that point and usually find his way to working for your opponents rather quickly in contrast the ai auto recruits mercs based on how the war is going and realistically doesnt have to worry about paying them because if youre winning they arent really getting paid its so bad before i started genociding them  it wouldnt be uncommon for any nation i warred with to have 1012 merc clans thats 40 merc lords more than i have in total in all honestly the only way to play the game because of this is to capture all of each merc group and execute them which makes you dishonorable and hated by literally everyone but its better than every nation in the game essentially have 40 extra lords to fight you which is what occurs there desparately needs to be a streamlined way to hire lords as the player and limit on the number a faction can hire like 2

banditssimply put as the game goes on bandits become too abundant and the player is the only 1 who will target hideouts meaning eventually they simply respawn faster than you can stomp them out

finances so finances are weird in bannerlord you will lose money supporting garrisons for your fiefs but forging a 2h sword is worth like 50k and you can forge more multiple of these in a day meaning being a blacksmith is more lucrative than a lord tournament betting is limited and rarely offers a good item but they are happening is almost every city 247 so you have constant access raiding offers very little money which makes it stupid for the ai to be so obssessed with doing it but beating armies offers a trove of loot and gold overall i feel like being a lord should be more rewarding i also dont like that your fiefs auto recruit garrison which you pay for and the game should be less about beating up enemy lords so you can make rent each day which is just nonsensical 

queststhis leads me to my next one that quests are so limited this is largely due to most quests having a requirement that results in notables spamming quests to you for instance if a village is under 200 prosperity it will request tools which results in that village requesting tools like 5 times in a row before their prosperity gets somewhere decent also it results in some fun quests being virtually non existent i have only gotten help raise a nobles son one time in 340 hours i have seen capture enemy lord maybe twice even worse once you are tier 6 most people will say oh this quest is beneath you even though it could be negatively affecting for fief each day it goes unfinished even worse several warband quests such as bounty hunting are just absent

game pacing  recruitment finally the last reason i cant reccomend bannerlord is the pacing  the problem is that notables replenish too quickly combined with the fact the enemy always respawns with 30 soldiers and will escape from any prison in 1 week means that you never really feel like youre making a impact against the enemy yes their 1st wave is always the toughest but after that they never lose the ability to launch 1k army assaults back to back to back it degrades a otherwise interesting combat system to being utterly meaningless it also means that ransoming releasing or holding onto a lord has very little effect with the only noticable decision being to kill them but once again everyone hates your for it

horse 

need coop

the throwing spear in this game is so strong that it makes me throw all of my responsibilities too

#####

wait until april 2021

all the core mechanics are there fun combat party building basic castle management but the majority of decorations and progression on the core mechanics are either broken or not implemented

for example
 multipler player progression
 skillability player perks probably 60 are not implemented or are poorly balanced tactics perk to predeploy your troops in battle does not work at all
 a lot of actions dont increase skill points eg collecting gold tolls dont increase your rogue skill 
 some skills have poorly balanced progresison ie trying to upgrade your tactics skill takes over 1000 battles where as progressing with twohanders may only take 100 battles

its like when you microwave a burrito its hot and tasty on the surface but when you take a deep bite into it the deep inside is still cold and uncooked so my advice is to wait dont bite the burrito let it cook a little while longer and you will be immensely satisfied

#####

after years of early access and lots of patches after 10 release later this game is still only early game meaning the first 1020 hours are fun this is the only reason why this game is rated positively
if you play long enough midlate game you will see the shit show begin
no real kingdom management no real diplomacy no real economy system and on top of all that an completely incompetent ai allies and enemies
they just added features but didnt flesh out  finished a single one of them also there seems to be no intention to fix any of the underlying issues
sadly cant recommend

#####

sieges still dont worktheyre already talking about dlcs when the game is a shell still ya know everything thats wrong with todays gaming is indeed happening at taleworlds

#####

i was a lowborn i ventured conquered grew my army married a noble woman then my save got deleted when the game updated 1010 best game

#####

10 years in development and 2 years of early access for such a whimper of a release and what new feature do we get in 10 achievements

this feels more barebones than warband we dont even have feasts i swear if they release feasts as a dlc ill riot

you are basically paying a premium for a modding platform

h1 procreation simulator h1

when i got this game i was kind of disappointment with the development however i kept playing in hope that things would get better to my surprise i missed the whole point of the  game later after my char got married i learned that mount and blade is actually a metaphor for procreation when i discovered this i had a blast creating babies all over the kingdom me and my bride would move from castle to castle leaving a trail of babies in our wake she would have one about every 510min and the funny thing is they never would age im happy to say that now at 1000 babies i am ready to retire from my campaign  hopefully when mb3 comes out i will have a greater supply of names i kind of gave up naming after 50 there are only so many way to use boo in a name  httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2048698927

#####

singleplayer in this game is a step up from warband for me
battles feel like they pack a punch sieges have been vastly improved giving the defenders a clear buff still but not as meat grindy as warbands sieges speaking of sieges upgrading your towns is more meaningful and visually represented
your party members are now members of your clan and you can have them do quests for you or form their own parties
more battle commands and formations to make the combat feel better
helping ai armies can get you control of a bunch of their units grouped up by category and the ai commander will perform a grand battle plan where it gives orders to you and the other ai commanders

if you want to buy bannerlord for multiplayer only i highly suggest you hold of for now
personally i find captain and siege to be interesting experiences but the skirmish mode is quite garbage 
on top of that there is a class system for multiplayer with very limited choices for equipment gone are the days of making your own builds or taking funny equipment for a siege battle or deathmatch since the alpha test the developers have made it clear that they absolutely wont move an inch away from the class system so no luck expecting that to get better
taleworlds priority is currently heavily towards sp and thus mp is not really getting much attention beyond fixing crashes or critical bugs fixing glitches on maps is a rare thing to see

owing to all of that i can easily recommend the game for sp but not for mp

#####

bought this game on march 30th 2020 to prepare for the crpg multiplayer mod that i hoped would eventually come out for it  never thought the day would come but the mod is out now and every bit as great as it was back in warband  buy bannerlord for whatever your reason is to buy it but do yourself a favor and give the crpg mod a fair and honest attempt i dare you to hit level 31 and retire  no other medieval fighting game out there is going to give you a competitive online rpg character persistence experience like what this mod will  as far as im concerned crpg is the game httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2878356589

it is certainly my favourite game would be nice to have a coop campaign but unfortunately it is not planned

#####

its suprisingly fun to cut down peasants

#####

yeah its a pretty good successor but not up to warbands level yet

#####

huge potential but atm the game is barely working gameplaywise they havent delivered on any of their big promises yet be it dynasty system diplomacy or whatever and have only been pumping technical fixes for half a year now and doing dumb things like nerfing income such as workshops and whatnot while smithing hasnt been touched at all in all this time and allows you to easily make say twohanders that sell for 150k each while cities have 34 times less gold in their inventory after just a few stamina bars spent on unlocking parts hell you dont even need all that fancy steel and such can make javelins out of wood and iron and still bankrupt cities with a bundle of those its like an inbuilt money cheatcode still 95 of every patch is crashfixes and refactoring i only paid them so they could refactor their monkey code that shouldve been in order in the first place or so it seems
in general balance is all over the place such as prices some mediocre bodyarmor costs like half a hundred of decent horses or a thousand pieces of grain truly endgame armor costs several times more but you can ride the whole world and not find a single one those barely spawn with default values even after creating more smithies khuzaits have too big of an autoresolve and movement speed bonus and dominate the map troop trees are questionable to say the least half the factions have way worse troops than other ones there isnt even any they are meh but they are real good at that one area thing going on anymore like battanians are meant to be master archers but their only archers are noble troops and good luck getting those in any number or sturgians who are supposed to be the shocktroop kind of guys but aserai and arguably even empire have better heavy infantry half the factions have horse archers now though if thats your thing individual troop equipment and stats still need heavy adjustment and although there already were a couple of those they somehow only seem to make matters worse some mechanics from warband arent here yet either kingdom management is extremely barebones underwhelming and just feels lazily tackledon recruiting is somehow even more obnoxious than previous instalments and lack of effective training skill means that losing a good army takes a looong while to recover from for the player whereas ai lords just as before summon huge leveled armies out of thin air ai lords are incredibly stupid too most of all at sieges so even the vassal phase is going to be painful especially after they nerfed all the influence gain so as a vassal you will only be able to lead an army once in a blue moon rest of the time being relegated to watching them trying to build a trebuchet for weeks which gets obliterated in seconds then disbanding the siege then doing it all over again the siege system is laughable in general but its a fairly minor complaint in the face of big problems in the game

tldr for another year or so just play modded warband as of now the game seems great when you are starting out but once you get to the endgame and start to uncover its inner workings it all just falls apart and burns gameplay loop is way less thoughtout than warbands and in a game such as this its all that matters in the end i hope they will deliver on all they promised meanwhile if not modders will do the bulk of the work once again i hope

#####

mount  blade ii bannerlord is a great game in alot of ways but it falls short and is disappointing in several key areas if you are someone who liked mount  blade warband for its multiplayer and you never played much single player or didnt really enjoy the single player experience and you are buying bannerlord specifically for the multiplayer experience stay away please do yourself a favor and move on if you are looking for a good medieval multiplayer game where you can fight other players and hack and slash with your friends consider chivalry 2 or mordhau or even for honor you would be far better off simply put bannerlords multiplayer is bad the hit boxes suck the connection is terrible every server lags the maps are bad the combat feels off the spawns are terrible the gamemodes have subtle changes that dont make any sense overall its just a giant mess all of that being said if you are someone who liked warbands singleplayer experience you want to play bannerlords single player and you are looking for a cool refreshing medieval rpg game that you can pour loads of hours into as you rally your armies and carve out a chunk of the world for yourself then look no further bannerlords singleplayer is really good bannerlord takes everything that was great about warbands multiplayer and throws it out the window and takes everything about the single player and builds upon it the end result is a detailed in depth single player journey that is a great deal of fun

#####

this game is so cool
man i wish women were real

#####

the best part of this game is the immersion  spent a few days getting up reputation with my soon to be wife thought it would help with having kids etc and as soon as we got married it dropped and locked at 0 truly the only realistic depiction of marriage in any game 1110 would recommend reminds me of real life

#####

been following the game since it was announced and supported the second it released

numerous hours spent playing and enjoying the content available but most of my time spent was bug chasing and trying to help with the ea and development

dozens of features that were promised said to be intended or planned have simply been abandoned 
the game lacks any real diplomacy the marriage and lord system is incomplete there are no feasts or previous features from warband the main quest still is not finished well over 2 years later smithing is barebones and exceptionally janky not only game breaking for the economy but also awkward to level and unlock specific things only minor improvements have been made

the devs have outright lied whether due to incompetence or willful ignorance we cant add smithing armor the game wont support it this far into development  theres a mod that does it
we cant add sailing or ship combat like in viking conquest the game wont support it  theres a mod for that
we cant add visual upgrades to castlestownsvillages or seperate upgrade systems  you guessed it theres a mod for that

theres numerous other main features like criminal gang elements and duels or upgrading workshops that remain placeholder and untouched the entire ea with no sign of improvement or even mention in the dev notes the multiplayer is barebones and imbalanced 

while the game can be fun its really just a combat simulator with a basic overworld map with some very strange ai choices cavalry have all but been nerfed into the ground where they rarely if ever connect with their weapons completely rendering them useless and archers  horse archers are basically an instant win in any sizeable numbers

you are much better off playing warband with all the great mods that finish a game that was also quite barebones making bannerlord seem even worse in comparison if you really want bannerlord for the upgraded graphics but barebones systems i would wait for a sale and at least a few months after release so that the mods that will undoubtedly fix and save the game are released and stable

#####

i havent seen my kids in 4 years

#####

ever wanted to feel like a 13th century european staring at an army that consists of more horses than men

ever wanted to watch a volley of javelins trim your family tree down to the trunk

ever wanted to experience the feeling of a couched lance piercing your hopes and dreams alongside with every piece of armor that cost as much as your entire army combined

ever wanted to throw away the lives of hundreds of your most loyal soldiers in a siege just for your king to hand the town you conquered to someone else

if the answer to all of these questions was no youre probably a filthy battanian

otherwise treat yourself to this incredible rollercoaster of emotions and its extensive library of mods

#####

feels like its still in alpha

#####

base game is very meh and not really worthwhile  but  with mods like realistic battle and diplomacy this game is massively better and turns from mehboring into incredible  if you dont mind modding andor bought the game and lost interest get some mods and give it another try  it might just provide you with hundreds of hours of amazing fun

#####

h1 edited after full release h1
h1 pros h1

graphics the environmental graphics on max settings are absolutely stunning every time i enter a battle i always take in how beautiful everything looks without a care while forest bandits massacre my troops

maplevel design the world map makes clear that it was meticulously made to be beautiful detailed and informative the amount of detail isnt really needed but definitely appreciated level design from battle maps to walking around a city is always exciting to look at and is even further enhanced by the graphics

combat and death animations from what ive seen theres a fair number of people that are still on the fence about the combat so i know this is highly subjective but i actually like it when i swing my sword its like my character is actually putting real effort into it it feels very punchy and satisfying death animations are a nice detail and welcome addition to spice up the game hitting someone in the neck with an arrow or knocking someone off their horse and pinning them to the ground with a javelin is oddly satisfying i swear im not a psycopath

bgm music in bannerlord is amazing the music makes straight flexing on 11 looters with 30 heavy cavalry seem epic

more appealing skill choices the game encourages you to diversify into different skill trees so you dont have to go only into the one man army route you can be a fighter who moonlights as a trader and smith

quests quests are about as varied as youd expect from a game where npcs are normal and take themselves seriously and not satire or parody characters like in other games which isnt an easy task

smithing smithing allows the player to make just about any weapon they want and customize it in just about any way they want it this gives the player the ability to craft literally hundreds of different weapon variations you can also give the weapons you create names making them all the more unique and memorable

workshop  mod tools kind of speaks for itself a relatively painless experience for the downloader

h1 cons h1

npcs almost all of the npcs in the game seem soulless just things on the map so it doesnt feel as empty they all react to you very similarly even your ingame spouse doesnt act all that uniquely the most varying personalities and dialogue you can expect from are lords who have more good traits and those who have more bad traits

sieges if an army youre following goes into a siege they must make ways of breaching a fortress be it a ram or siege tower then the leading lord can make other siege engines like a catapult ballista or trebuchet all of which are almost entirely useless theyre useless because the defending fortress can make siege engines of their own and even start out with a couple making the engineering skill take a looong time to level up to help with the situation most often by the time the attacker makes 1 the fortress has 4 and almost immediately destroys it because for some reason despite having wheels they assemble and instantly deploy it within range of the fortress the lead attacking lord will either stay there forever making infinite ballistas to be destroyed or just go in with a ram andor siege tower making the overall sieging experience more tedious than fun in the early and midgame if you want a siege battle where you can operate a catapult that shoots flaming boulders during the night or trebuchets to devastate people youll have to be on the defending side which will most likely lose due to the overwhelming numbers causing you to lose your inventory and soldiers or just about your only choice is to set up a custom battle

npc design and facial expressions the facial design and animations in this game is comical if not a little disturbing in ways that would give mass effect andromeda a run for its money in the encyclopedia they look somewhat normal but they all look very strange when you actually meet them npcs will treat you to a smile if theyre friendly towards you or if you let them free which can act as a deterrent as theyre smiles look like what youd imagine a madman had while they come at you with a knife all teeth and eyes bugging out

combat ai ive had archers repositioning with their bows out and stare me in the face as i actively attack them instead of taking out their swords and defending themselves cavalry which has gotten better since ea will still often miss people walking in a straight line the strategy of the ai lords in this game can be kind of weird be it not giving archers a good line of sight or charging cavalry into the spears of infantry rather than flanking

grind in this game it is a slog to go from earlygame to midgame and to lategame everything costs so much in this game and there isnt much you can do about it without cheesing it as there arent any real effective or fun ways to get money on top of that the game limits you to how many workshops which gives a passive income you can have which is dependent on your clan tier making it that much harder to progress quickly a game set in medieval times should not have monopoly laws that good

misc things its not as often as it was in ea but ive had the same lord attempt to raid my village multiple times in the same war i defeat them then they come back 3 days later trying to raze the same village with less and new troops making them less likely to win i dont know if theyre low on money or if its just a part of their personality traits either way theyll keep harassing you until the war ends or they die another thing that hasnt been fixed since ea is that soon after you start your kingdom is that half of the other kingdoms will declare war on you which can be stressful and difficult for new players and if they lose their kingdom because of this they may be forced to start almost entirely from scratch the campaign is so shallow that i cant say that its good or bad however those resources could have been better spent to improve other parts of the game

general lack of content the game is very fun within the earlygame but the lack of content becomes very apparent while youre grinding to get further in the game doing the same 45 quests over and over again to earn money and relations and trying to get renown to raise your clan tier once you get to the midlate game nothing fun is added to your adventure youll be doing the same old stuff just on a larger scale there are so many places to flesh the game out for example the politics in this game are very 2 dimensional and at times dysfunctional yet theres a lot of potential for quests and a more in depth system give npcs more actions and reactions so they feel more unique adding more to the players story

i dont hate this game i love mb and i want to get my moneys worth but this game should not have been taken out of ea nor should it be charged at full price while there are still so many things that plague this game like bugs and balancing issues to ai and a clear dearth in content over the past 2 and a half years of ea very little has been added to the game you can see for yourself in the patch notes and updates i know there are people who will say and have said that mods will fix the game and make it good and i dont doubt that for a second dont get me wrong modding and mod tools add to the games credit but the individual mods that  creators make shouldnt especially if those mods are supposed to make it good and fix the game and are depended on to make it fun this feels less like a game and more like a foundation to one so if you are still considering getting it get bannerlord at half off or close to and maybe show the modders some love by donating the money you would have spent to the mod creators hope this helps 

#####

at its core this game is really just warband 20 

thats a good thing to me because thats all i really wanted the core gameplay is fun but shallow mods are what will really make this sequel shine

#####

i  wanted to finish the full game i wanted to play to the end conquer the map and retire in the mountain i used a mix of settings between standard and realistic to up the difficulty mid way through the game then applied a few qol mods to improve the gameplay into late game and tried a few item mods that were supposedly lore friendly but didnt add much value short of a variety of looks for the player and his party that did not extend to the npcs so the world was still quite repetitive by region 

i had 4 play throughs the first 3 to learn game dynamics whats changed from mb 1 and how to exploit game systems to my advantage to create my own kingdom 

as youll see on many other comments and reviews after kingdom stabilization theres not a lot more game play other than color painting the map little by little as kingdom battles ebb and flow 

the game is fun no doubt but if youre a completionist and going to the very bitter end is your thing without easy difficulty youre going to get bored for the last 34s of the game 

the game has a lot of dynamics that create a difficult early game mid game and early late game crawl however once you master those dynamics the random event counters are extremely low with rebellion and other factors mostly preventable and tribute surrenders and easy system to exploit in your favor give the amount of cash you were able to amass and how low you conquered a kingdom which was in decline 

mods used
diplomacy  wanted to gain and maintain and ally but got too powerful too quickly so never got to leverage that feature
dismemberment mod  realism
improved garrisons  realism flexibility with kingdom expansion especially before bringing other clans in but easily exploitable to give you too much of an advantage
mod configuration menu  mod reqstability
butterlib utilities  mod reqstability
uiextenderex utilities  mod reqstability
bannerlord software extender blse utilities  mod reqstability

total hours played  455
total individual kills 5500
game years to complete conquest  25
total game hours for the 25 years  180 factoring in wars battles decisions and planning time paused 

recommend 1010 but would like to see more nonbattle factors evaluated for mb3

#####

successor to warband consider bannerkings an essential mod they really need to let modders make their game perfect by simply settling on a final patch

#####

the game is pretty good but i have no idea why theyre releasing it now it still has less content than warband and only really does battles better than it 

the endgame is still pretty much nonexistant there are no random events the ai is still bad both in battles and in the overworld theres no command for your troops to focus on specific enemy formations so theyll target whoever is closest usually resulting in all your archers shooting at the three cavalrymen instead of the 100 man infantry charge lords have no personalities your conduct or relation with lords still has no real impact theres no diplomacy no alternative ways to power like assassination or bribery the economy is still utterly broken and smithing is the only way to actually profit large battles dont feel decisive because the ai can instantly field another army managing fiefs and castles is still tedious and unbalanced theyre basically just drains on your income the culture debuff on conquered settlements is still permanent so you always have to micromanage loyalty and getting married and having a child is still worthless since by the time the child actually grows up and becomes a playable unit youve probably already conquered the world ten times over there are about a billion more issues both large and small the plague the game currently like bugs and performance problems but you get the point

bannerlord does battles and combat well but thats about it theyve said that updates are still gonna come but its worrying that this is the state that theyre fine with releasing the game in im giving this a negative review not because i think the game is bad but because i think it couldve been a whole lot better if they just kept it in early access for another year or so

#####

havent been so hooked on a game how i am with this title in a while quite refreshing sandbox army builder sim with a nice plot intricate clan and npc affinity system smooth combat simple perk system and no handholding play how you want at your pace with freedom of choice whether you wish to side with one of the kingdoms or create your own ill be playing this one for a while

#####

i love mb as a franchise and i played the first one in its earliest alpha i remember how excited i was in 2012 when this game was announced yes that long ago but this game is fundamentally broken and the core mechanics only give the illusion of what they purport to do it is unfortunately putting lipstick on a pig 

ive played this a lot and it has many qol improvements over warband but the same stuff still comes up and were in 2024 im not even going to mention the slew of bugs that have still been in this for at least a year there arent any excuses any more 

fighting for a faction is frustrating going to take the enemys last city oop nows the best time to make peace cheers king nothing and if you dont go rogue and loot one of their villages to force war losing you lots of influence then theyll rubberband and  surprised pika  declare war when theyre back to full strength 

sieges are even stupider and broken for the large attacks you usually have to auto resolve because you guarantee if you go in yourself therell be one or two people stuck in a wall by the end big hint taleworlds maybe if its been 10 minutes without a kill and you have 700 attackers while they have 2 perhaps there should be some auto resolve mechanism but this has been an issue in the franchise for literally 15 years

and taking out cities are even easier build a trebuchet then put it to reserve which means it disappears instantly into the ether rinse repeat then deploy all four trebuchets simultaneously they pop out of thin air and you pound the opponent into oblivion its just stupid 

hideouts  nobody else does anything about them its a boring whackamole situation and gets super tedious same with a significant amount of the missions 

the economy isnt an economy nothing matters or affects anything goods come out of nowhere people come out of nowhere the x franchise may have its issues but egosoft can make an entire selfsustaining economy this requires nothing close to that scale

everything good about this game is balanced with something hugely frustrating yet the biggest problem is that these are issues that you simply cant have in a singleplayer game 

the irony is that with all this jank if you had pvp multiplayer campaigns  no fast forward no pause just a realtime running clock on vanilla this would probably be one of the best games of all time 

the only real way to balance an unbalanced broken game is to put more humans as enemies so everybody is equally broken and have one of the craziest maddest offthewall campaigns 

taleworlds have said this is impossible even though a multiplayer mod is currently being worked on and proven in proof of concept 

its not the first time that taleworlds will say one thing and modders will actually achieve it thats basically been the formula  but in bannerlord taleworlds have annoyed a lot of modders with their behaviour and mod support for this is dying as well

#####

this game is amazing  the first time i played warband  i couldnt believe my eyes that i found a game that met every desire i had while playing a game  campaign map is like heroes of might and magic  battlefield like total war while i command my troops while fighting beside them  economy  family  etc   
the problem is that it is still an early acces and it has alot of bugs  i use mods to make the game better otherwise i would have quit a long time ago it has alot of bugs and alot of things that dont make sense and these are the following 

 the campaign main quest  running arround in the begining to find 10 heroes that know of the battle of pendraic  is the most annoing thing ever 
 family  it is not finished and i hate that i cant marry off the members of my family and when i get married i get an offer for marriage for me and my brother  seriosuly  marry me and my brother 
 leadership  as a lord or as a king why do i need to make small errand or search for other characters  why cant i have messengers to set a meeting or something like that  searching for characters that are always moving is really boring 
 fighting system  yes it is smoother than warband but it lacks the impact  the satisfaction when you hit an enemy  it looks like a bunch of girls are fighting with sticks 
 titles  there are no titles  no kings  no sheikh  no khan etc everyone is on a first name basis
 parties  there are literally no party options like follow me  or patrol  etc and when one of my clan parties is defeated i need to manually recreate the party every time  really annoing 
 diplomacy  diplomacy is one of the most boring things in the game  no allianes  no pacts no nothing
 recruiting lords  in warband it was great that lords would come to you to serve you as long as you would have good relations with them and a good reputation  in bannerlord you have to run arround the map searching for the leader of the clan just for him to refuse you or worse accept and  demand an outrageos sum of money in order to join
 mods  every time they make an update all the mods crash  you need to wait for the mod authors to update their mods and post them cant we do something about this 

these are my main complaints about the game but i solved this by using mods and i hope that taleworlds will implement things like these in the future and make some real improvements because most of the time i see bug fixes and not really a gameplay improvement

#####

with all the recent updates id have to give this game an 810 i really do like it and want to see it the game finished and out of beta phase theres a ton of things id still like to see implemented in the game but i will wait patiently even if nothing more is added my rating for this game wont change i enjoy the game as is and mods only make it more fun 

the current game is set to feel more like a warhammer game with you as the physical commander unit unfortunately for you unless youre up against a bunch of peasants with pitchforks or bandits with pointy rocks and butter knives youre going to struggle in larger combat scenarios if you try to go head to head against the enemy the ai isnt very smart and theyll pull some really stupid moves when given control i cant count how many times id given the ai free reign of my troops while i charge the front lines with my personally crafted 2handed sword and i find myself in the same situation as optimus primefighting in the woods alone surrounded by 6150 enemies with real army equipment unless im late enough in the game to have my fitness skill high enough to outrun most troops thats a good way for me to find myself dead 

the easiest way to go against armies is actually pretty realistic skirmish with an archer unit while cavalry flanks with their lances and have your infantry advance from the side to surround the enemy when the enemy has heavy cavalry themselves just use your own horse and aim for their riders with your 2handed axe or a polearm if youre practiced enough with the bow you can get headshots on other horsemen for days even at range in close combat with the real men its heavily recommended to use a 2 handed axe or the sword  shield i like to make the game more of a challenge and turn off the autodirectional block feature so having a shield is very helpful to my survival especially because more often than not i end up veering away from my infantry line and picking off a group of enemies that leave me backpeddling while swinging my sword trying to survive

outside of combat the other game mechanics are pretty interesting there are several quests offered at random from settlements be they villages towns and noble lords the longer you last in a campaign the more challenging the quests become on average the hardest quests are either raiding settlements of a warring faction or capturing a town that might have upwards to 700 defenders that leads me into raids and siege battles

raids are pretty simple and somewhat difficult to fail ive never seen a village with more than 60 defenders and its set in an urban area with houses and fences so its normally no trouble to deal with the peasant levies i fear no amount of infantry troopsits when they have archers and stupid amounts of cavalry i start to be worried unless you prepare to fight them in the battle by changing up your formations you can estimate each enemy horseman is worth 2 of your infantry troops sometimes more if your line of archers is left undefended from their charges 

in a siege battle on a castle or a town sometimes the best answer to the siege being successful is to not build any siege engines at all there have been numerous instances where i have had better successless casualties by just using ladders to scale the walls than a wheeled tower if you have more men than the enemy defending a settlement and youre able to breach the walls the rest is a cinch and you can essentially autoresolve unless youre using a monster of a computer and set the maximum unit capacity to its highest setting there will be several pocket groups of soldiers spawning once a set amount of their unit type die infantry archers horsemen horse archer and have set spawn points not too far away from the ai sets them to defend once a castle or a town is broken into and your troops start flooding in you can wholly expect a plethora of the initial craven defenders to break ranks and flee for their pathetic lives its a favored pass time of mine to hunt them down before they can escape into the lords hall since each killed man is nothing more than experience points in my eyes 

when attempting to build relations with lords of the realm the best way possible is to spend time first as an independent mercenary instead of immediately selling yourself out to the nearest faction take your time and do quests for the leading noble houses to build relations and work on your roguery skill by raiding caravans from far away kingdoms and performing jailbreaks for any and all lords when you see them locked in a dungeon theyll be eternally greatful if your efforts are successful if theyre not youll find yourself in the same dungeon behind bars alongside them in the worst case scenario youll perform the jail break but either you or the other escapee wont live to see the light of day again 

yes your player character can and will eventually die either from combat a warriors death or from disease or old age  this can also be toggled onoff in the campaign menu but its far more fun that way and losing can be a very painful experience especially if you happen to have a spouse or kids thankfully if you have an heir of age death is not the end your new player character will instead be your child who inherits all the assets of your clan and potentially your kingdom if you had been named as the ruler its most amusing to see the npc reactions to your new player character especially if you happen to run into the noble lord that remembers executing your past character in combat lol 

once again i give this game an 810 rating because its so much fun and its always replayable combat never exactly gets boring because of the changing terrains and battle conditions and the variety of ways you can approach most interactions i recommend to all gamers that enjoy games like total war warhammer conquerors blade kingdom come deliverance empire at war

#####

needs work but fun

edit getting much better more fun

edit 2 still getting better more fun

#####

very fun but it could be so much more if it were updated more regularly

#####

i have 787 hrs as of this review  most of it during the first 2 months of ea release  ive enjoyed all my hrs playing  yes it has bugs and progress is slow at higher levels but i love the army building aspect of mount and blade games  growing from a lowly individual to having a powerful kingdom  i just wish i could care about the npc characters more a bit  the npcs are blank slates and i cant connect to them or care about their causes  i always end up going off on my own   i never execute the npc lords though because then the world becomes empty of any atmosphere  while i enjoyed my ea play i dont think ill pick it up again until full release  i recommend this game but maybe wait for a better build

#####

the game is quite fun in the first couple of hours after that poor game mechanics bugs and missing features become frustrating although the game has been already released it is far from finished

siege mechanics are awful

city management lacks depth and it doesnt bring any value

ai is very bad

diplomacy although it exists its useless

so many bugs i dont even remember you get spawned outside the map troops fall through the map in the middle of the battle especially sieges companions go missing

theres a ton of missing qol features that should have been there probably the developer is counting on the modding community to do those this is just cheap

no boats

the battles are fun but they tend to become a grindfest in midlate game

the game is far from finished should still be in early access

#####

fun but lacks critical features from the first game that really matter in making the world feel alive they should have built off the feasts feature improved diplomacy through compromises and added utility to throne rooms they did not do any of these things

#####

so this is a mixed review leaning towards negative  i want to be up front that i was a huge fan of warband and really looked forward to bannerlord even buying it almost day one when it became available  i cant pretend like i havent had some good times with the game but it has issues  ill offer a breakdown below

pros
  looks much better than warband and some character modelstextures look great
  vanilla added muchneeded mechanics like being able to make your own companions vassals toggleable permadeath for clan members andor everyone else the ability to sire fifty children and wait fifty actual hours for them to age up ingame etc
  the combat is largely the same as warband which is good  
  has workshop support finally
  still one of the best horseback fighting games out there
  i feel like i should add more good points to avoid feeling like im complaining but my complaints are the chief reason i made a review so heres a placeholder  

cons
  it builds on warband a bit like warband built on original mount and blade  theres huge improvements in terms of graphical appearance diplomacy leveling and perks and so on but it doesnt feel significantly upgraded enough especially with the long early access time it had to work with
  early game is absolute hell  even making your character during creation all about combat fifteen looters with rocks and pitchforks will utterly mess you up and the default horse they give you is apparently only allowed to run at 5 mph or itll explode from the rpms  you can slam your spear into the looters noses hit them with swords and it does scratch damage because of crap skills and equipment but those stupid pitchforks will stop a cavalry charge and do 1516 damage per strike  ludicrous
  the game has the potential to be an immersive storytelling simulation even a dynasty simulation of sorts but actually fails to do this anyways  you can have siblings children spouse etc but the interactions are just as bland and formal as anyone else  the copypaste dialogue is so rampant everyone seems to be onedimensional  you can create a narrative in your head that you won your acclaim in suchandsuch fight making an enemy of lord soandso and then went on to take castle whatchamacallit but none of it really matters  everyone treats you the same based on the scale of rep you have with them and their faction to the point where you have smiling goofy looking enemy lords who genuinely think youre awesome and then kick your ass and put you in jail  the ageup process for children is even within the accelerated time of the game ungodly slow  the idea of playing as a hero and then later their descendants is very awesome and bannerlord has the foundation for it but ultimately it just feels shallow
  speaking of shallow war mechanics are a dumpsterfire  so the lords routinely declare war and peace based on what i can only assume is some kind of calradian astrology newsletter  this results in zerglike raids on enemy castles and villages  the problem is threefold

1  the enemy always can field units even if not many by grabbing them up from any settlement within arms reach  they dont seem to have to worry about morale starvation or troop wages either  this means some enemies never take a break but keep pushing at your boundaries again and again

2  the only way you can stop a lord from being a pita is to chop their head off  even though you probably murdered a hundred kerns last battle and maybe your comradeinarms or wife yes thats happened in a playthrough for me died to their lance cutting their head off is basically a universal warcrime and everyone hates you now  on the plus side you can absolutely decimate annoying factions this way and only this way as peace is expensive and easily broken and any other meaningful diplomacy is not supported by game mechanics

3  if you do eventually do too well several bad things happen to you  for one your lord will grant you too many castles unless you use badass points to sway the vote  this just bogs you down in landlord simulator with dumb npc quests that waste your time morale problems food problems and dealing with raiders who have no logistics to worry about  another if you stomp a faction into oblivion the lords will just drop flags randomly and bother you from their new gang  you can have every single castle and settlement in your control as ive tested and these morons will still be finding recruits and raiding your stuff without hope of winning for eternity

  companions are pretty boring  they come to you with backstories but once you pay them they just become special units you can customize  they dont have continuing arcs they arent meaningful companions and even if you make them vassals theyre generic  the potential for rp in this game is basically zilch
  the end game isnt worth it  eventually you will bloat out so much youll want to farm out your holdings to vassals  except these expensive idiots will constantly mismanage these settlements sometimes losing them to uprisings  theyll also often lose the troops you gifted them no matter how badass in fights with inferior enemy lords or get captured needing ransom  it actually is better to just serve an npc king and let them deal with the nonsense while you play castle domestic simulator with your emotionless wife who gives you a bunch of kids you cant tell one from another until you get dragged off your horse by some peons in someone elses army defending your mud farm villagers from raiders

tlrd it really could have used more polish  instead of worrying about stuff like mp they could have better embellished immersion mechanics so the world felt alive and fun  instead it feels like a really hollow upgrade of warband and thats just not doing it for me anymore

#####

bannerlord
taleworlds didnt deliver on their promises there is no criminal enterprise no diplomacy the world feels empty the ai is pure shit and your settlement cant become anything but a settlement even though it was said that settlements would become castles and castles would become cities they have been lying to us since the start and it is now very obvious that they tricked us its just a dumbed down version of mb warband with less features 
if one were to buy the game i reckon waiting a year or two would be the best option because modders will by then have completed the game for taleworlds
the full release of the game is sad and disappointing taleworlds employees should feel ashamed no one said stop at any point of the development just kept running like a hamster in a wheel and killed a franchise good job

#####

done 20 war crimes in 20 seconds

#####

610
the basegame lacks alot but they made a good framework i guess

with mods this is a 9510


#####

it is not perfect even after almost 3 years

but somehow it takes me back to the 2009ish when i play hours an hours the original mount  blade while finishing my final paper back then love this game 

#####

thick tavern maids

#####

one of my new favorite games if your new to this game look up strat gaming on youtube he does a great job explaining a lot of the complicated things in bannerlord

#####

this is a hard game to review i cant not give the thumbs up its too unique too much fun and too addicting i have 600 hours already and i just got it a couple of weeks ago and i dont see putting it down anytime soon

just be warned this is one early access game that lives up to its status ive been spoiled by games like minecraft factorio and satisfactory games that were priced humbly full of amazing content and rock solid for me anyway games that felt complete already and then kept on delivering on a regular basis well bannerlord doesnt keep company with such ea games bannerlord lives up to the ea disclaimer its obviously unfinished buggy as all get out unbalanced frustrating freezes every play session and at any given time youll wonder whether the developer has abandoned the game updates are infrequent and small and they barely bother to communicate with the players

still id buy it again is it worth the price only in the same sense that usury is worth it if you owe the mob its worth it only because it doesnt have any competitor except its own outdated predecessor i figure they figure they can charge what they do because fans dont have an alternative but it does say something that there is a large im going back to warband contingent within the mb community

#####

as of this writing i have spent over 900 hours in this game idling around 1015 hours bannerlord is complex enough satisfying sometimes visceral and absolutely amazing for an early release title

the writing is rather solid and often times well done for example the back stories of companions are detailed interesting and rather well written production values are great all around and the small graphical details are surprisingly nice

nothing is more joyful than unhorsing a rider with a deadly blow or the right lucky hit high speed jousting javelin tossing horse archery and hack n slash are great the sieges have been improved recently from what i can tell and are also excellent

that all aside the political system is surprisingly complex and nice with many different ways to use influence points or maneuver to better position your clan in an empire hell maybe one day you or i can even become the ruler thats possible

all in all a great game check it out

8510

#####

cant wait for some grindy persistent server to show up and waste thousands of hours of my life into it

#####

rough around the edges towns and interpersonal relationships could use some work but wholly unique in scope and exsistance

#####

ive waited for this game for so many years and then sunk over 500 hrs in it 200 on the beta version and looking back at all the time spent i realised i enjoyed very little of my time played this game is only good and accepted because it is the only game that offers this kind of experience no matter how broken poorly designed and generally frustrating that experience may be 

the vast majority of the playtime in this game is spent trying to exploit or circumvent poorly implemented and poorly designed mechanics the game actively tries to stop you from having any fun 

battles the battle ai is just sad it will either run to the edge of the map if you overpower it or it will just rush you in an uncoordinated manner when it thinks it has an advantage no tactics no skill no challenge 

overworld despite being told from day one that kingdoms are completely unbalanced nothing meaningful has ever been done to address that the khuzaits and aserai will just roll across the map if left unattended map ai is better than battle ai at least but there is some antiplayer bias 

clan this is one aspect i do enjoy its decently enjoyable to grow your clan have members be born companions lost in battle assemble caravans assign governors and other parties 

economy probably the most poorly designed aspect of the game the devs actively want to prevent you from having any passive income as of the last patch they completely destroyed workshops cities towns castles and workshops provide no money while garrisons cost huge amounts you are actively punished for having many cities and high quality troops youre left with roaming the land selling blacksmith weapons and other loot for your warchest 

overall at the end of the day this game is just unfun game mechanics actively work against you and despite thousand of comments and years of feedback devs are refusing to implement common sense changes to make the game the fun sandbox weve always wanted mod scene is basically dead as the game is unstable and any small update breaks all mods after waiting almost 10 years for this game i now have little hope this game will ever get meaningfully better

#####

this is quite an amazing game to play if you like adventure and grinding to be the ruler of a massive empire it sometimes feels hollow though to an extent that made me quit until the game develops more depth ill wait till 2025 to play again

#####

literally mb warband but better

#####

ive been grinding this game the past couple of days and believe i have enough experiance with the single player to write some form of review ill start with the 
pros
improved graphics
very nice armour system
better recruitment
much improved player models 
combat feels smoother in single player
the ragdolls are really good
beautiful world map
improved upon political systems

cons
same bugs that plagued warband
 still got the same optimisation issues as before lagging and stuttering on a 1080ti
horrendous quest variety 30 and a hella long wait when 80 of the villages have the exact same 3 quests repeated same for towns and lords the current variety is laughable especially for a 30 game
gameplay is more along the style of viking conquest due to the extremely slow paced nature of the game
factions are unbalanced 
armour variety is really really bad 
not enough quest variety
but most importantly the world still feels completely fucking dead the npcs react to nothing you do have no interesting dialogue and still refer to you as a man if you play as a woman this kinda lazy writing might have been excusable in 2010 but in 2020 nah 
crucial features still missing for example the dynasty feature feels paramount and unique to this game and yet it isnt finished or in the game 8 years and all they got is a perma death system without the fundimentals supporting it

conclusion
after the inital nostalgia wore off i began to realise that this game in its current state is essentially feels like it was originally meant to be included in the multiplayer beta but because of budget and time they decided to release it at full price i cannot recommend this game fully at its current price because of the horrendous bugs and features that plague this game along with the lacking laughable content

#####

game is really good it is a huge improvement from warband
but it lacks some features warband had like assigning your own formation or feasts but its not a big deal
the game is really fun with mods
without mods tho can be very dull
every playthrough i do i always use like 34 mods that makes the game better or add features that the game lacks
like diplomacy realistic battle mod kaoses tweaks to reduce the grind or just modify the game the way i want
as for now is it worth it
with mods def 100 worth it
without mods wait for full release to see if they are gonna do any big changes or not

#####

i grew up on warband which is a masterpiece of a sandbox game i liked bannerlord its visually beautiful especially the armor and landscape but the pacing of the early access is much slower than warbard catch me training my army for a good 2030 hours of gameplay before i could even think of creating my own kingdom dont get me wrong  combat is excellent and the visual of the huge armies is spectacular but it gets repitive the pace of the game moved faster in warband i advanced in a kingdom faster trained my favorite army talked some guy into marrying me and delcared myself as i am the rightful ruler of calradia and then started conquering the map the flow of the game felt right the flow of bannerlord doesnt quite feel right the mechanics have the potential to be excellent the whole miniboard game thing is fun and i like the more customed interactions but they dont feel like they go anywhere substantial it seems harder to gain favor and then another long time to be in a stragetic position to use that favor speaking of give me a track lord feature on the map or give me death the potential of the clanfamily feature and the revamped governing system are very promising as are the new economic opportunities and these might shine as new additions but even they can feel cumbersome when added to by the games slow pace the quests are rough they arent actually enjoyable but in warband at least they were relatively simple and a break from battle bannerlords are more drawn out with no new experiencesadded bonuses than regular gameplay you either fight or talk to people its the same as the entire game you just have to ride across the entire map first these games arent skyrim and it shouldnt be but would be nice to need to use some degree of skill to complete a quest or solve a puzzle rather than just legwork im still incredibly excited to see this games finished product and it was immersive and fun for a good while but i might return to warband which still feels like my medieval home and wait another few months for new updates

#####

the game is great but for a really good experience you need mods cant complain with a game you have played for over 600 hours lol

#####

yup its a mount and blade game yup it consumes your life

do i recommend it   not if you want a life outside of dating 3d princesses

#####

well afther playing this game from the first launch  with a break of 1 year i must say the gameplay got better but it seems to be in a sort of stalemate like the devs are out of inspiration    no offence 

the things i would see in this game and would make it a goty 
more diplomacy options like truces alliances and a more balanced matter of kingdoms declaring war 
more kingdoms and more land landplots 
the option to start villagas
continents schips and naval battles like mnb warband 
faster maturing of children 
better ai commanding options like placing generals for your inf archers and cav and be able to put them on ai command 
more crafting options like armourbreeding horses training soldiers
a ban on recruiting soldiers of different factions so the armys dont look like ragtag warmongering bands 
growing settlements 
deceases like plague etc
snow rain etc regional weather 
more units
better ai gameplay at the worldmap
ai kingdoms acting accordingly to their leaders trait  evil neutral good insane
invading forces to the realm giving the ai the chance to make peace to confront the common enemy 
victory improves loyalty and betters relations with allies friends vassals while lossing wars decreases these
the chance to destroy a city  or rebuild it from ashes 
more build options like some citys need types of buildings first to construct or produce certain items units
pirates
beginning of big 1000battles  commander giving a war speech  ala braveheart

things i would like to see improved
option to clear rebel camps with a army
more enemies in rebel campslargercamps
better economy 
stronger cavalry
better shieldwall


forgive me for my english
i like this game  i will uninstall it again and play it in 7 months i hope the devs read my message p
this game has alot of potential  very good game  it needs the final touches to make it excellent


#####

been playing this game for far too long now not to give it a public review completely blown away by mbii sandbox mode in this game is fantastic so nice for developing roleplay characters time period feels very fall of the roman empire with each faction playing a role in the map dynamics development team is doing a fantastic job updating and hotfixing as they refine any hard edges would recommend to anyone whos interested

#####

very good but needs mods

#####

i waited years for a sequel to warband and assumed it would never come when i heard news of bannerlord i was ecstatic as reviews came out i became a little wary but the desire to play grew and grew until finally i gave in this is everything i hoped it would be and more i do recommend using some small enhancement mods such as improved garrisons or diplomacy to have a heightened experience but all together this was an a in my book good game good story improved mechanics and a great modding community what more could you ask for

#####

good game only thing missing is coop hope the devs add it one day

#####

very good game hope that they make mods available like for the older versions it would be fun to have got or lotr game modes

#####

this game is a gem the graphics are beautiful the gameplay engaging and the combat has the type of depth that you dont see in many other games  bannerlord is enjoyable on a lot of levels from the rts arcade type oneonone combat that takes a few minutes to learn but about 100 hours to master to kingdom level strategy where you lead 2000 men and now some women into battle  when i first got this game i went to the arena and trained oneonone for 8 hours  honestly even that tiny slice of the game is fun replayable and almost worth the full price
the battles are where this game shines and leading an army never felt more realistic the combat is deep with  the unique mount and blade collision based combat the sword actually has to hit your enemy in 3d making a lot of realism flow naturally from it   character development is great with lots of interesting choices and skill builds melee builds and horse archer builds feel almost like two separate games
the endgame is not quite as strong as the mid and early game but it is still fun especially with a couple of mods  i always play with the improved garrisons mod for example 
this brings me to the odd phenomenon of the vocal minority who hate this game but still play hundreds of hours just look at some negative reviews  they fill the forums and message boards and i never quite figured out what their problem is except they all seem to be fans of the original game who wanted some mystical product that never materialized well i am sorry for them  but for you i recommend this game 100  its already awesome and will get better with time  get on the train now you will enjoy the ride

#####

devs just announced the games full release in october this product is the final argument in favour of never preordering or falling for the early access scheme no matter how beloved a franchise is regardless of the devs previous work

i supported the games ea funding based on many promised and showcased features that will not make it in the end it was supposed to be more than a step above warband we were shown many possible forms of strategic and tactical interaction that breathed life and would have made for a living world with towns featuring notables with their own agendas gangs of bandits staking their claim over areas of the towns themselves a real economy that if hurt through interactions other than do battle would result in enemy lords seeing the quantity and quality of their troops diminish significantly as a result

as it stands none of that promised different ways to play the game have any noticeable impact and what new there is only appears late into a characters progression usually by which point they arent needed anymore smithing your own quality weapon youll be so rich you can buy twenty of them by the time you can craft just one after grinding thousands of other weapons with a limited stamina system resembling mmorpg crafting grinds except even worse

early access means such promises are not set in stone ive heard that bs excuse too many times but what is by far the most jarring is how broken or lackluster everything else is ai units who still dont know how to climb ladders during sieges groups of ai soldiers standing still and not reacting to the pc approaching until twothree of them get killed ai lords on the campaign map dragging their allies into suicidal army battles due to bad positioning and randomwalk maneuvering tournaments being only slightly better than in warband ive played warband mods that made them a lot more engaging and interesting early game progression still being a boring slog in certain regards even worse than in warband the companion system being definitely worse than in warband generally speaking the design and execution of this game follow a warband  idea with the player having the same goals and methods as in warband but without a superhuman hero of a character who can keep swinging a greatsword cleaving through several enemies tirelessly like a war machine

lots of halfbaked ideas poorly implemented if at all is how id sum it up

the only good thing coming from the release will be the possibility for players to make their own game via mods and inevitably fixing this games bugs and technical failures instead of the devs because they cannot do in 2 months what they havent been able to do in 6 years

lastly regarding my playtime ive had fun for about 15th of the time ive spent in it mostly it was regularly coming back to check the state of the game after several major updates coming away very disappointed each time im sure that in time thanks to mods ill clock in a lot more playtime but a triplea pricetag for what is essentially a base for modders to work on is most definitely not worth it

wait for after release and buy on a major discount

#####

edit its been a few weeks since release and the dev team has been able to squish a lot of the bugs and mods able to address basically all the issues i had with the game combat issues have been and are being addressed xp issues being worked on and fixed with mods and various systems receiving a lot of love

as it stands this is the better sequel to vanilla warband however on the surface vanilla warband truly didnt have much to offer for merc  vassal  kingdom relations which could be supplemented by mods that fleshed out these systems a lot more mbw provided a wonderful base for other better versions of the game to exist

i think thats where bannerlord is at now its an improved version of vanilla warband with cool systems improved graphics and new features but its still just that upgraded warband did you like vanilla this is a really fun game were you like me and most of your time was spent in some mod or another this is still a really fun game but its still vanilla so until the modding tools come out youre sol if you want something more substantial than the usual gameplay cycle

original review below

this is a really hard review to write considering ive been a massive fan of the series for years have 500 hours in warband not as much as some i know understand that im a singleplayer player i dont care about multiplayer

i should mention that i have full faith in taleworlds making this game what it has the potential to be  however im not reviewing the future

pros
 after two days the dev team has already released two major hotfixes that fix a lot of issues if they keep this behavior up im certain this game will be actually decent in as short as a month from now
 the game is stunning the map is new and very pretty and there are a lot of systems in place that werent present in warband its also a lot bigger and the economy is pretty cool even if its not fully functional yet
 apparently the modding is going to be absolutely crazy  were getting actual mod support instead of just trying to decompile pyc files to actually mod things given how much warband modders were able to do im super excited for the potential here
 the new systems that are in bannerlord are interesting like getting to smelt your own weapons do thievery  roguery and the barter system these systems fleshed out will be amazing

i wont mention the various bugs  crashes because they are likely going to be fixed here in the next week or so having 200k new testers tends to have a tendency to make things a little easier to bugfix some notable ones include archers not firing softcap on the number of saves you can save before the file becomes corrupted economy giving you 15k denars  day all bandit hideouts crashing your game etc etc etc

cons
 the game has been in development for 8 years and im wondering where it shows yes the game is gorgeous but the lack of fleshed out systems broken economy bugscrashes and lack of basic systems like fief bartering kingdom management politics many ai issues etc make me wonder exactly what all that time was spent doing they have a custom built engine but im on the side that says their subsidies from the turkish government for the last decade have left them dragging their feet and im afraid were seeing the result of halfassed workmanship showing from it
 many of the systems listed above arent fully functional kingdom management isnt in yet there are only about 10 quest types and political diplomacy isnt really implemented
 im a little girl and am upset that there is no autoblock feature although i expect this to be either modded in fairly soon or taleworlds will cave to the overwhelming pressure to add it back in
 leveling is really slow compared to warband and there are more strict hardcaps to your skills previously there was a skill which raised the hard cap for combat skills by like 70 or so per point invested now it raises it by 20 and youre still expected to reach 275 proficiency on some things even with the much slower leveling
 combat is slower i cant really tell its different than in warband same concepts though and my muscle memory disagrees with it its not even the blocking feature honestly theres just some delay i think this is either because your skills start out very low and are also really slow to level unlike warband where you also start very low but usually plateau in the 150  200 range for a skill in general this may just be the same system but the perception is skewed because the highest level you can reasonably attain in a combat skill is like 70 still out of like 300 mind you or more realistically 40 to 50 this slow combat feature also exists in warband but doesnt matter as much because it evens out once you become proficient in a weapon in bannerlord youre never proficient in a weapon
 level scaling is off for everything as mentioned the hard caps above basic farmer recruits will already have stats that outlevel your midgame character my imperial recruits have something like 50 1h skill even though theyre level 6 im sitting here at level 15 with my 1h skill hard capped at 40

with the lack of how well the game is actually fleshed out at this point id honestly recommend waiting a little even a few weeks before picking it up its not bad and i want its potential to grow but theres still a fair amount of issues with it for now that i find myself going back to warband mods to find a fuller experience

have owned this game since the very first day of early access been watching patches for a while and have not seen a content patch that actually adds anything significant for a very long time this game went into early access almost two years ago its got decent gameplay but the amount of bugs crashes and overall balancing issues plague the experience and even makes testing an unfinished early access title almost unbearable i will note that i at least appreciate the work that the devs have been doing to attempt to fix some issues but more importantly is where is the content

this game is severely lacking content even for an early access game because i know some of you will point that out remember almost two years have passed since early access started the pandemic happened sure but they have had time to get things done

on a positive note if you like combat this game does not disappoint the combat can be fun when the game functions properly also large scale battles are a thing 

i like mount and blade and i really want this game to be good however
i would not recommend in this current state or in the future until meaningful improvements are to be made

taleworld took their time but bannerlord is shaping up to be everything that people were wishing for in a sequel to warband

they good direction regarding the development roadmap an excellent set of modding tools cant wait to see the real large mod sets show up and a proven history of sticking to their product for years to come

#####

the bozos in charge of this game decided to remove the ability to organise specific troops into formations for an inferior system where you can have formations give preference to specific people like ones holding shields key word there is preference so if your trying to make a shield wall you are going to have random great sword users standing in the way getting shot like lepers this has not only made it harder to plan out battles it has no justification unless you think humans are so stupid that they couldnt follow orders like i want the skirmish cavalry on the right and the heavy calvary on the left so its not realistic its less strategic so its not a game play improvement no one was going around asking for less options so its not requested yes its faster to do on the fly so if you squint and tilt your head you could call it an accessibility feature over manually sorting them so what keep both and let players choose what to use dont take control away from us 

whoever the actual idiot that decided this was a good change needs to be tossed out like they did this system im not changing my review until they are or the system is added back without a modder taking it upon themselves to do so

single player is ebic
i got called the n word many times in mp

#####

alt click to follow caravan

1010 would siege again

#####

not sure what happened i downloaded the game and stated playing next thing i know i look up and everyone in the real world is wearing masks and i have dedicated 391 hours to this game 

im the kind of rpg player who will make it through half a game with one character and for no reason at all will start a brand new one for shits and gigs i have like 100 different skyrim characters im no different with this game but on a larger scale because the choices are endless want to go vanilla and make an imperial who follows the story line great want to be a bandit king that messes with all the kingdoms because eff them thats why do it shoot make yourself a battanian and call yourself robin hood want to go from a mercenary to a trusted vassal where you are putting babies into a kings daughter just for the king to die and the rest of the kingdom make you the new king totally doable want to make your own kingdom and then steal away your enemies vassals and make them yours takes a lot of work but you can do it so many possibilities 

also the mod community for this game is legit once you get high enough the micromanaging becomes insane but there are mods to help with that there are mods for improved game play more equipment even total continent overhaul shoot theres a mod where your character can swing for the same team and you can marry a male noble

i love where this game at is now and i cant wait to see where the developers continue to take it

eight years for this you gotta be kidding me

game feels like a remaster of warband with new graphics and a few new things
i dont care that the game is in early access when basically all gameplay and concepts from warband has been brought into this remaster
when the game itself feels so old i wish they could have polished or done something about the atmosphere they talked about in 2016 
here are some small things i wonder why they havent done anything about in 8 years of development
1 cant talk to your own prisoners in your own castle im not allowed to speak dude im the freakin ruler
2 women are refered to as men in quest lines quest from girl  he wants you to yadayada
3 empty castleyard when you have an army garrisoned in your own castle lonely af no atmosphere or anything
4 no diplomatic button to see your relationship status with other factions and charactersthere is a diplomatic thing when you become part of a kingdom but you still cant see relationship status with others
5 build and weight was showcased in 2016 its gone now
6 you can only make peace offerings if enemy faction engages you and not the other way around
7 people in the city you are the ruler of doesnt know you

 all these minor things and more just kills it considering it has been in development for eight freaking years game lacks some serious interaction and logic from npcs

edit

im going to try and address some of the common comments for the sake of doing something in the time of corona 

first of all im not some pro reviewer i just play games and express what i see and feel about the game in its current state 

questionstatement why do you continue to play if you dont recommend the game
answer many reasons to cut it short i bought an expensive meal i thought was worth it am i going to eat it even though i dont recommend it well yes its not like the game is shit and i never stated so

questionstatement bad criticism only complains about minor things 
answer i didnt experience any major bugs or glitches myself i did crash twice but thats not something i personally care too much about because thats something thats very likely to be fixed something like npc interaction and logic is not npcs treat you basically the same whether youre a peasant or ruler i personally care about how the world interacts with you and thats its dynamic and changing in relation to how you progress through the game and as i said the game lacks heavily on that numerous answers from npcs are just copy pastas a bonus to this is when soldiers are waiting to climb the ladder they just graze at the grass around them or stair up in the sky which again ruins immersion for me
small bits of crap adds up to one big pile of crap im not saying bannerlord is crap cus its not

questionstatement game is not finished its ea
answer i know and i didnt address small time bugs and glitches i addressed some core issues i see with the game issues that i personally care about hell i care less about bugs and glitches than core gameplay and npc logic and interaction if the devs do change how npcs interact and so on ill obviously change the review but i personally doubt a recode of npcs

tldr 2012 gameplay with 2016 graphics

instead of personal attacks try and form an argument so we can discuss the franchise we all hopefully love d

#####

how long till you actually implement an ai that isnt absolutely garbage

2 giants holes in the city walls and my troops hug the gate instead of going through the holes seriously how hard can it be to sort out your ais

not only do have to deal with pointless updates that only break previous saves after all this time they cant even design an ai that goes through breaches made into the walls and dont get me started about the ais inability to climb a ladder theres a reason why have to destroy the walls of settlements as the ai cant figure out how to climb up the ladders and just huddle together letting the defenders shoot them to death

having to use mods to make basic fixes which the developers refuse to do issue there is as soon as they update the game my save gets destroyed the game is fun not gonna lie but it is also frustrating beyond all belief losing countless soldiers due to bad ai which the devs refuse to fix

then got the other siege engines troops running into the side holding the ammo because they dont know how to path around to load it so artillery is useless 9 times out of 10 

put plenty of hours into this purely because i have to keep starting over due to devs breaking my saves

stop exploiting early access to not fix or put any effort into your game

another new issue is the peace mechanics as i have now had 4 saves ruined due to the enemy kingdom only doing peace if they pay me 30000000 a day which ruins economy and bankrupts the kingdom and only way around this is to stay at war with them why is there no option for just a white peace so i can avoid this broken mess of a situation

#####

bannerlord for a very long time was a living meme since the game was in the development for eternity with no clear release date at sight  to the point there were even rumors if the game exists at all

ive managed to get it very early right after the game was available in the early access and while amount of bugs crashes and issues was higher than any other game ive ever tried to the point it felt more like early alpha the core of the satisfying gameplay and the reason why its named mount  blade was still there back then i said that itll be a masterpiece if taleworlds manages to resolve all of those issues and polish those round edges with enough of effort and they truly did

today i can say that bannerlord is the sequel to the warband that every fan was waiting for it feels like taleworlds was listening to the players as the game includes all the things that worked creating a marvelous rpg game with very deep world to the point one can really dive and lose himself in the simulation

like previous games bannerlord also follows make your own adventure scheme where you have a lot of freedom in terms of what exactly you want to do while the core of the game remains very advanced battle system it doesnt feel like other options such as being humble merchant small mercenary or a ruler of the kingdom were left out

ive put almost 300 hours in total in this game and i could play it for even longer it really doesnt get boring hours pass like minutes and long after midnight you realize that its monday tomorrow and youre not getting enough of sleep  again

for every mount  blade fan this is a mandatory position taleworlds delivered on the promise and weve got a sequel that weve always wanted for people that didnt play mount  blade series yet this is a very good position to start as long as youre into deep rpg games with no single plot to follow but rather making your own with a lot of possibilities and diversity in the process

while not the best game of all time its in the strict top for me and i can heavily recommend it for everybody that has even the slightest interest in becoming a lord with his own army during medieval times sure there are things that could be executed slightly better but no game is perfect and the fact that the game managed to resolve my very mixed impression during early access proves that its worthy to consider especially for people that will play it for the first time

game has just announced its releasing on consoles 

we did not wait this long pay this much money into an early access game to pay for console development 

multiplayer is still a piece of shit with no custom servers custom maps which made warband what it is today

taleworlds i am disappointed in your development team and production team 

shame shame shame

#####

the first game mountblade warband was a masterpiece and the community made great mods for it and made it more popular with that

talewords have seen to be forgeting to update multiplayer for this game tho theres so many issues less content and etc modders are trying their hardest to bring live to the game itself

modded has more people than native

#####

since its early access i wont talk about bugs or missing features

does bannerlord have the potential to be a great game absolutely but it isnt there yet not anywhere close

the biggest surprise is the unit promotions which unlike other games of this kind make a meaningful difference on the battlefield as a direct result choosing any units progression path becomes an integral part of the fun to figure out ones best desired army composition as a side effect in the arena tournaments even standard units can become tough nuts to crack kudos for that

the two by far most annoying features on the other hand are ai intelligence and kingdom status the troops are dimmer than a bucket of bricks the most hilarious blunder so far was my siege defenders deciding to climb down the attackers ladders in order to get butchered piecemeal and since that is not anywhere braindead enough they tried so hard to get on the ladder next that they elbowed each other from the top of the wall into the mote way to go knuckleheads

as for the kingdom status my beef is not on principle but with actual gameplay so you somehow have to get a settlement that doesnt make you a king however now you have to ask permission in the main quest no joke as kind of a backdoor you can become a vassal instead sounds nice when you are limited to a 100 people and the possible enemies each have upward of 12000 but you get the fief your liegelord decides whether you want it or not so when your liegelord starts yet another braindead suicide run you end up with a fief smack in the middle of enemy central whats worse the enemy liege may be on his own suicide run so it takes them forever to overrun your defenses with an invariable tentoone ratio every day you own that hopeless burntout husk of a fief it empties your coffers with expenses beyond those of your entire army in effect that kills the vasall option and youre back to bootlicking your path through the convoluted main quest they should fire the designer and every playtester

another major design blunder is the character leveling instead of happily gaining level experience playing whackthehead with variable victims you gain experience in order to raise skills only the resulting skill points now level the character which sounds nice in theory but has two major stumbling blocks in practice first you have a learning limit which means once a skill hits the current limit experience means squat second and maybe worse since the means to raise the learning limit you get by leveling is less than what you need for the next level you are forced to develop every skill or else watch your toon treading water that forces you to follow a skill development script rather than just developing the character you like again who designs something like that

in case this is not obvious this also nixes the concept of the clan roles surgeon scout etc for your companions who cares if you have a 100 medicine surgeon when he or she is hogging the medicine skill points you desperately need to level and here goes yet another nice idea down the drain

you may observe i already played some eighty hours so why whine about a game that is evidently worth two full work weeks well for one bannerlord is a time sink you dont get anything done quickly said eighty hours were my first campaign until my happygolucky vasall found his untimely demise defending a fief he never wanted unfortunately much of these eighty hours passed watching my little band of scalawags follow looters over the landscape at the breakneck speed of an air bubble drifting in a tank of molasses why i didnt give them horses because by the time i could afford them i needed 110 buying them four at a time i didnt live long enough to ever see it happen and just so this is clear the problem is not slow movement in an of itself the problem is that your decision process whether to attack a moving target invariably changes from can i do it to do i spend an ingame day hunting something possibly in the opposite direction

whats worse it kills the trading youtube has tons of clips that tell you where to get some fish and where to sell it they brag with riches like medieval carpet baggers they just conveniently forget to tell you that it takes a realtime hour to get from a to b and that is only if you ignore any moving target that isnt running in generally the right direction

which brings me to smithing sure i love crafting sure i know it takes time and is repetitive sure i know that game designers think its funny to eventually earn a five perecent chance for a legendary weapon but using every down minute of resting to heal in order to sneak in a smithing skill point i managed to hoard less than thirty points in eighty hours 30 out of 300 this is which changes the question at hand from how cool would it be to smith legendary to it takes me how many realtime weeks of exclusively pushing the same three buttons to get there

in summation bannerlord is like a fantastic pizza which just hasnt been long enough in the oven please put it back in for another half hour pretty please with sugar on top

#####

mostly played singleplayer bought this game early if i remember right and havent played in some time but it happens from now and then and i really like this game love that the devs keep fixing and building new things upgrading main quest and so on
really wish there was a coop have a friend that havent play this game yet but if there was coop i could get him to try it if he would not buy it for himself i would buy it for him d

#####

we were dangerously low on gold and were down to the last of our supplies knowing that we stood the best chance of profiting during wartime we ceased our retreat over hill and glen and turned to confront the pursuing enemy  though at a disadvantage we met for a parley with their commander
we greatly outnumber you he said urging us to surrender disagreeing with his offer we prepared for the battle

archers to the rear atop a hill for elevation and as a vantage point
infantry to the front form a line
cavalry to me

we stared down the wooded hillside and watched the enemy approach in mass  every now and then we would see their armor gleaming in the sunlight

shieldwall my hero cried the front line closed the gaps between them and stood shoulder to shoulder a rain of arrows pelted them killing those that were to slow to raise their shields in time
our archers returned fire with a volley of our own the sound of bowstrings thrumming and the whistling of arrows flew overhead

spotting the enemy commander as the army emerged from the treeline my hero led our cavalry though small in number back around the hill and along the right flank of the enemy they had no idea we were there

the sound of crashing steel and splintering wood echoed through the trees we could not see the two armies as they crashed but we heard the cries long before we saw them there they were the red uniforms of the vladians were unmistakable against the verdant green of our battanian horde their backs were turned to us as their archers fired up the hill that we had chosen as our refuge

charge my hero cried our mounted units quickly advanced into the line of attacking archers and cut many down in our first pass looking up the hill i saw that the enemy had foolishly advanced into the waiting spears of our scorpion formation their numbers had immensely dwindled

my hero gave the order  at them he shouted our battanian infantry broke their formation and charged down the hillside using their momentum to run down the now retreating imperials  among them was the enemy commander urging his routed army to turn back and attack

rallying the cavalry once more we charged toward our prize

#####

very addicting and  anything added at this rate is a plus for me



update on review yes i have played a lot not to the number shown as i have left it on a lot so maybe half that lol

#####

cautious recommend 

the skeleton of the game is there and its quite a large skeleton its whether it gets fully fleshed out theres certainly a lot of work ahead for the devs to do that with the various elements which are present but dont feel complete yet or are still clearly unrefined and unpolished can easily see this remaining in early access for a couple more years

wishing the devs luck with pushing things forwards

#####

for the multiplayer and combat i cannot recommend the game ill be brief because of character limit i tested the alphabeta for about 900 hours
gamemodes are scarce customization is totally absent combat is bad balance nonexistent developer response to feedback abysmal

 h1combath1
the main characteristic of mount  blades combat is being highly skill based easy to learn hard to master in warband the mechanics were simple but the way they could be manipulated by the player offered a huge degree of freedom and separated new players from skilled veterans you could play for 100 hours and get a good idea of the combat dynamics but youd need thousands of hours of practice to truly master the combat system and compete against the most experienced players in bannerlord on the other hand combat mechanics arent simple but totally overcooked with multiple unnecessary variables that go into calculating everything from stuns to movement speed these variables offer zero control to both casual and competitive players alike and all they do is add a feeling of randomness and inconsistency which combined with the games mechanical functioning with the animations for instance and the pile of present issues do not allow the combat to have nearly as much control and freedom and as a consequence the skill ceiling is absolutely remote from warband essentially you could pit a relatively new player against a pro and the new player would have good chances of beating him because the current combat does not allow the player to use their skill and experience to the full or even an acceptable extent  its littered with issues which we have been pointing out in closed tests for about 10 months and yet they are still present there are many contextual problems  for instance damage to horses from up close being totally negligible while becoming extremely high with speed bonus  however i will quickly skim through the issues of the core mechanics to avoid writing an essay movement is horrible its floaty and sluggish it feels like youre dragging your character around any time you change directions due to acceleration issues and on top of that the way momentum acts makes it often feel like youre sliding around the place or ice skating acceleration to top speed on the other hand is extremely quick and deceleration to combat speed combat speed is a lower movement speed that kicks in when you do any combat action like blocking or preparing an attack is very slow combat speed is slightly too high and the strafingbackpedaling speed ratio isnt quite right which mixed with the issues above makes it so that youll often find yourself fighting players constantly sliding around you spamming or attacking you and immediately moving out of your range bear in mind that movement could be fixed with a few parameter changes but nothing has been done in all these months of beta 

the stun timings are off which in turn means that the rhythm of combat is off  to briefly explain how it works if i parry an attack i will have a stun duration which prevents me from attacking until its over its very short similarly if i attack i will need a short time to recover before i can attack again  the current timings make it so that the defender has a very large window to respond to an attack while the attacker cant recover very quickly essentially you cannot put pressure on the enemy by punishing them for poor reactions or trying to get a 2nd hit in with the correct positioning since they will always have enough time even if they react very late to attack you back this transforms the combat in a stale hitblockhitblock sequence which goes on forever on top of that stuns are extremely inconsistent because they are calculated using a large variety of totally unnecessary physical factors so one time you could get a short stun and another a much longer stun and you can never really tell when that is going to happen shield blocking is directional blocking in the right direction will make your shield receive less damage however you receive so much less of it that even blocking correctly by mistake will essentially make your shield last forever you could block for 30 minutes straight while waiting for your team to come help you again something that could be fixed with one number change the speed to ready an attack is incredibly sluggish it feels like to prepare an attack or to switch between multiple directions it takes ages similarly blocking speed is noticeably slow and this could get you killed particularly when using heavier weapons no matter how quickly you react all of this makes combat feel totally unresponsive the arcs of swings are huge you could hit someone almost behind you this inevitably incentivizes spam as one way or the other youll end up catching the opponent in one of your wide swings furthermore glances are not animation based as they are in warband meaning too early in the attack animation your attack will always glance off but they are damage based which however means that theyre completely inconsistent and you will find yourself almost never glancing simply because you go over the damage threshold this means that you could hit someone when your swing has barely even started leaving them no time to react 

feints are garbage mostly because of how long it takes to switch from one attack to the other however if you sped this up because of the way the animations smoothly transition into each other they would become op as it would be impossible for the player to understand when one attack ended and the other begun moreover because of these transitions at the moment your feints can go through a players blocks or body making it look like it was a real attack this could be fixed by making the transitions between animations break up just a little more but of course nothing has been done the balance between different attacks is off right swings offer you the highest range but theyre also faster and the easiest to hit with reliably chained attacks essentially combos chaining one attack into the next are useless theyre actually slower than performing 2 normal consecutive attacks this mechanic makes absolutely zero sense right now chambers countering an opponents attack with another attack are broken they require your weapons to physically touch to happen this requires a precision that no player can ever achieve on top of that the timings are so unreliable that chambers only ever happen by mistake kicks are equally useless the stun after kicking is never long enough to follow up with a hit so youre essentially exposing yourself for nothing there is a stance system in the game meaning your attacks will be slightly faster if youre in the correct stance left or right at this point its still unclear if they also have any other effects however stances are controlled with your movement keys moving right or left which entails that you will never be able to use them correctly as to use stances you will be forced to disregard your footwork which is extremely important essentially everyone fights without thinking about them and it adds to the feeling of randomness and inconsistency

h1developer response to feedbackh1
id write more if not for character limit but essentially for the whole beta duration it felt like talking to a brick wall barely any changes were made even changes that only required 1 number tweak and it felt like we were being almost completely ignored they didnt even bother to give us a proper environment to test the game such as duel mode so we had to resort to community mods to test their game to give them feedback practically a waste of time i cannot recommend the game at the moment until the developers get their shit together start listening and start fixing the game

#####

never would i imagine getting 1 shot from a looter that is throwing rocks to the face


#####

bannerlord looks great visually but compared to warband it is missing so many old features and fails to introduce new ones making the game feel unfinished

#####

finallyafter waiting for a very long time bannerlord is heregetting the full attention from everyone who played the previous titles and the ones who are willing to dive in the world of mount and blade 
h1 at start h1 
bannerlord is set before the events of mount and blade warbandshowing a more torn apart calradiathis time with an interesting plot and opportunities to begin with and a more detailed beginning than warband

bwhats the biggest changes b
combat is now much more betterthe world feels alive nowseasons changes weather conditionslords and kings always lurking aroundrecruiting troops and managing caravans and stuffand too many goddamn looters
and this game makes you a tournament addictthey are better now with great value prizes and more atmospheric fights
no more wooden toys pal you will have to fight against steel and death bit too much but aight 
tradingpartyclanscompanions and needs to survive like foodmoneyand morale are now subjected to a new form of managementpersonally i found it much more better
i am not going to go full detail because most of the players already did in their reviews

b is it worth buying now b
thats what i really wanted to talk aboutand the true answer is no
dont get me wrongbannerlord is great and its not about being bad at allbut i want you to know that this game will change in a huge way in the future and i have the highest hopes that if this project was carried out with care and hard workbannerlord will be the goat
so if you want a truly amazing experience i advise you to wait for the right moment to buy it because as every ea game is has alot of flaws and performance issues and when the game is finally well optimized the devs will move to the next step that is adding more content to the game
 the best thing about buying bannerlord now is to feel in the future the good impact that the new content did on itand thats why i bought it in the first place

 h1at the endh1
high hopes for this game and the devs in generalthey are doing great and i am sure that they will keep going in the right way
am not going to talk about the cons nor rate it because it is too late to do so now
and yeahcan you add its almost harvesting season again please  p

#####

as my dog once said bannerlord aint that bad

#####

ive spent a thousand hours in mount  blade 1 mb 2 is everything part one was only prettier and bigger if you liked mb in the first place you need this in your life

if you did not enjoy mbs repetitive gameplay maybe stay clear of this

for me rallying my cavalry troops to follow me telling them to get into a wedge formation then circling the enemy infantry crouching my lance and just charging in never gets old not after a thousand gameplay hours
