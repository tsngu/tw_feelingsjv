h1a sport you love a game you hateh1

look ill tell this beforehand ive been a hardcore f1fan for more than 30 years when there is no race im following f1news love all the on and off track drama and everything related to the sport so this review will maybe be a bit over critical but it comes from a good place f1 manager is supposed to be giving you the feeling that youre calling the shots be it on or off track it succeeds in some but fails in most heres my comprehensive review 

h3an f1weekend on averageh3
the drivers arrive trackside on wednesdays or thursdays on average where thursday is press day which the game doesnt use to any extent btw on fridays on a nonsprint weekend the drivers have two 1hour practice sessions saturday has a third 1 hour practice and qualifying and on sundays they drive the gp  300 km or 1865 miles the practice sessions make or break a drivers weekend crashing or having mechanical issues will more often than not result in a below average qualifying and race result f1 manager tries to simulate these conditions by tracking 3 parameters track setup and parts knowledge these 3 parameters result in a weekend average of confidence which has an impact on their quali andor race results are you with me so far great

where f1managers falls short is that there is no focus on the use of tires during the race weekend at all f1 uses 3 different compounds of tires during a race weekend soft medium and hard tires all with their own time delta an unique operating temperature knowing the graining and overall degradation of each of the compounds is an major aspect of having a successful quali and race f1 manager misses out by not forcing the player to do a mandatory amount of tire tests f1 irl has a race and quali simulation test somewhere during practice sessions f1 manager has none which messes with feeling of being in charge of an f1weekend 

h3quali and racing hit or missh3
the qualifying sessions are as close a real race weekend in terms of on track action i really love the addition of mandatory tire use on some race weekends hard q3 medium q2 soft q1 missed chance is not implementing the new sprintweekend setup which has regular qualifying on friday and the sprintquali and race on saturday instead it follows the old rules where a sprintweekend has a sprint race on saturday which determines the grid on sunday a format which sucked irl imo 

huge frustration during qualifying is drivers on in and out laps blocking the drivers on a quali lap sure it happens irl as well but you just know that when you come across a slow driving car in a certain turn that you can terminate your fast lap because youre going to be held up its better than in last years game but its not good enough just make the threshold for drivers slowing down and giving space even bigger than its now within 5 seconds for instance and if the drivers do impede then give them a penalty no penalties are given in qualifying ever 

the race is a big hit or miss also tire management is just not good like at all driving in dirty air has huge repercussions in a real f1race on your tires on your engine cooling but driving within 1 second has a real biig advantage irl drs but the drs in f1manager barely does anything maybe you gain a tenth or 2 you know what happens when a red bull follows a mclaren on the baku over 1 km straight with drs it blasts past them even when being over 07 seconds behind them but theres little real impactful tire and temperature management blue flags and drivers getting out of the way is nonexisting and when taking over a car thats about to be lapped they become a menace by clinging on to your back because they now have drs and all of a sudden have a car thats able to keep up with you 

h3managing the teamh3
a compliment where a compliment is deserved of the ui in the management portion of the game is great everything is easy to find you get accustomed to each menu and submenu within a couple of hours if you have played last years game the transition is almost oneonone good stuff the team management in itself is good but still to shallow for my taste give me more options to train the drivers let me take them to the simulator and drive a race with them to improve certain aspects let me have conversations with the crew let me see the pitcrew training let me pinpoint on where to exactly improve i want to feel immersed in f1 this gives me the feeling that im experiencing the surface of something that has much more depth

h3some final wordsh3
if you made it this far massive respect for your persistence like i said ill probably spent an insane amount of hours with this game because ive just put verstappen and norris in the same team verstappen has bono as his engineer and norris has gp i can take the best personnel from each team and make an allstar f1 team develop my car into an absolute beast only to be thrown back in the midfield at the start of the season what is that about 

is f1 manager 2023 good enough to have a casual experience of what f1 is like yes is f1 manager 2023 good enough for more hardcore fans looking for something that truly represents their beloved sport no not by a long shot and given the lack of support of the 22 game and the financial results of frontier this last year it doesnt bode well for f1 manager 23 to get proper support where bugs are fixed and more features are added 

if you read all this i hope that ive helped a bit in making a purchase decision thanks for reading

stroll just crashed in singapore under a vsc 
realism 1010

i defended frontier before the release of this game i will not make that mistake again f1 manager 23 urinates on the grave of a beloved dead franchise this reanimated corpse has started to smell and fall apart my recommendation is to not buy another entry in this series and to go play motorsport manager instead i do not recommend this game to anybody

there are major bugs that go unfixed the game cannot get the f1 rules correct the major example is the ai will use the same tire compound for each stint in their race while f1 rules require that 2 different compounds are used with 1 compound being a mandatory compound medium or hard with an exception for when wet tires are needed the developers kept promising to fix things in the game but never addressed this glaring issue

the latest hot fix introduced a regression where the costcap in the game will not display correct figures you will still be held to the cost cap but dont know what it is due to the display issue that regression from the hot fix still has not been fixed for me this makes the game almost unplayable

the races feel clunky and awkward this year the simulation behind the scenes determine certain outcomes such as two drivers racing wheeltowheel coming into contact the display engine to render that outcome seems to have to force the outcome which results in weird issues where drivers appear to try to kill their rivals by turning directly into them there are various other issues reported all over the steam forums and subreddit with funny screenshots such as cars coming to the pits and then exiting and racing with no tires

the lack of care is evident in this game i love f1 and i love the concept of this game the execution is poor and with issues not being remediated i feel duped i forgave these actions last year thinking it was the first game and the issues would be fixed in the second i should have waited to see do not buy this game do not buy next years entry frontier needs to lose this license

#####

last time well ever see guenther on the cover

#####

its basically last years game with minor changes and updated drivers

theres still a lot missing drivers still get punished for crashes they didnt cause and strategy is much less important because the punishment for overheating tires is now much more severe making alternative strategies basically useless cars still get held up a lot during qualifying drs trains are still massive driver confidence sounded nice on paper but doesnt matter if youre not in a frontrunning team

some parts got even worse such as car part development where you cant just press a button anymore to compare your car to others now you have to click multiple times also the interface got worse overall

and these are just the details there are still major flaws such as the sprint weekends still being wrong or ai using significantly less engines over a season

if you havent played f1 manager 2022 you can get this one on sale and once more of the obvious stuff is fixed if you already own f1 manager 2022 dont be as stupid as me stay away from the game maybe well get the game weve paid for next year

#####

i badly want to like it but this game has released unfinished and unfun
 driver confidence makes no sense and is gamebreaking if youre a back runner and qualify high your drivers confidence will be destroyed in a few laps as the pack inevitably gobbles them up you are better off qualifying last on purpose to gain confidence through overtakes
 overtaking lapped cars is stil an issue if you and an opposing car approach a backmarker prepare for the backmarker to move aside for your competitor and then block you up for the next 3 laps it happens every race happened in 2022 and was never fix
 most importantly the tires make absolutely no sense i have tried replaying a few races to just get a basic understanding as clearly theres more depth than i can gather to me it seems nearly random old hards are outpacing new softs 35 softs are regularly hitting fastest lap times if youve grinded out a 56 gap to your closest competitor by managing ers and tyres prepare to have that competitor just out of nowhere beat their best lap by 3 seconds and be right behind you if theres game depth hidden id rather just see it somewhere give me one sentence that the aston martin on old hards has come alive to explain why my fresh softs are losing 2 seconds a lap to them i need to be able to be able to see why some cars can run faster lap times when their tyres are 28 because if i cant see the reason i just assume there isnt one and its random
 i understand why this mechanic was added i really do but i absolutely hate the new driver ai the driver ai being able to just randomly attack without warning is fine on paper but these races are 2 hours long and theres a x16 speed to simulate part of the race you cannot simulate a single lap without risk of them disappearing into the distance you can dip to an insurmountable 25 second gap in one lap if youre not paying attention even on x16 i now have to micromanage every single lap and that is terribly not fun for the way i play 

for me theres not one single thing that was improved upon from 2022 the things i liked are now worse and the things i didnt like still exist i was going to pass this year as im still enjoying 2022 but the fomo got to me and i thought vegas might be worth it i wish i hadve not purchased 2022 scratches the itch i have and 2023 does not

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnxyri1ikhlclistplal6rztlwhcyciktsq0bmadlsgz7b_

i paid full price for f1 manager 2022 and i am angry that they dropped the game so quickly
frontier have sent me a review key for f1 2023 mark my words that wont guarantee a positive review from me i am still pissed off about f1 manager 2022 so they will have to impress me a lot and win me over

unfortunately they only sent me the key 24hours before release so i have had to rush this review through all gameplay can be viewed on my youtube channels and you can see for yourself any bugs or issues i encountered in realtime

h1the quick review is this h1
1	f1 manager 2023 is the better game of the two in every single department this is a noticeable upgrade
a	tyre wear management and relevance have been greatly improved
i	surface and carcass temps making management way more important

b	ai race behaviour events and situations have been expanded and enhanced upon
i	radio comms are significantly improved with numerous real world soundbites
ii	each part has a life expectancy

c	cinematic crashes and incidents have been enhanced
d	the ui has been modified and in some areas enriched
e	pitstops and crew are now critical to your race and not an afterthought
f	and there are two new gameplay style features available which are actually quite fun

2	however
a	most if not all of these upgrades and improvements could or should have been applied to f1 manager 2022
b	the game is still miles away from the level of depth we enjoyed in motorsport manager
c	ui issues still exist leading to unnecessary click fests and many repetitive actions
d	the game is not bug free yet
e	there are many potential improvements they have not tapped into
i	which leaves scope for improvement  
f	yearly releases with improvements get expensive fast  additional dlc costs each year

h2what is new h2
1	the two new key gameplay features are replay 23 and exclusive scenarios

2	replay 23 releases a new challenge with each irl gp round throughout the f1 2023 season
a	they challenge you to improve upon the real team results during the f1 23 season
b	actually it is a fun and welcome distraction from the harsh career environment

3	some exclusive scenarios are hidden behind a paywall so you will have to pay extra to get them
a     12 is too much for these 12 scenarios

4	sporting director  pit crew training experience and energy levels with dhl pitstop competition  i kind of like
a	this totally adds a new dimension to the gamei am still testing this out
b	raceday pitstops now winlose you places

5	we have a new helmet camera which looks great
a	turns a little too far to the left and the right on most corners imho  ignoring the car insideoutside

6	tactics for each driver and confidence level confidence seems a little basic atm
a	good improvement but not really well implemented lacks depth  we cannot use it until after the race start

h2what has improved h2
1	the raceday experience has been improved a lot
a	radio comms crash animation unexpected events explosive tyre blowouts  punctures
b	ers has a bunch of new control elements which i think improve the experience
c	ui tweaks bring tyre temps into a better location and really improve their relevance
i	tyre degradation and management is vastly more realistic
ii	pit stops are now relevant and will win or lose you places in every race

d	ai driving overtaking etc seems a little better but not perfect
i	still jittery illogical and frustrating most of the time

e	the new tactics tab adds a small amount of depth but much more could be done
i	plus we cannot set or change this until after the race has started

2	parts now have a life expectancy dont know why but low life expectancy boosts acceleration
a	a cool new featurebut with issues

3	apparently havent tried this yet new contracts can take effect at the endbeginning of a season
a	instead of immediately  that is more realistic

4	f2  f3 seasons are now simulated in the background drivers improving etc
a	sadly we cannot race them

h2bugs and issues h2
1	although parts degrade you cannot replace them
a	rear wing 50 conditionok swap it for a fresh one
i	you cannot the option is greyed out  you can only swap for a different one  wtaf

2	although the ui has seen an overhaul a few tweaks and some new options
a	there are still way too many unnecessary clicks
b	huge amounts of unnecessary repetition because of the poor ui
i	why cant i set my default p1 p2 p3 setup and have them auto load for each driver

3	prerace setup minigame has been simplified and made even easier
a	just feels like a pointless exercise now
b	i want more simulation and depth not less

4	my 2nd driver destroyed 4 cars in the 1st race of the season
a	no injury to him but could not continue p123 or the race
i	i saw the penalty but not the incident didnt show up

b	lack of info meant i could not repair the car to be used again
i	but i could have kept him lapping in a broken car slowly and gained experience points
c	worse still he out performed my #1 driver with broken parts in qualifying

5	i was in a fantastic point scoring position when russell wiped out and caused a red flag
a	we all parked in the pits for 20mins
b	on restart i had an extra 8litres of fuel on board
i	so i could push the engine harder but weighed loads more than the ai and as such were much slower
1	points lost

h2missing features h2
1	we still cannot create our own team

2	we still cannot race from f3 upwards

3	no autoswitch camera option

4	more immersive character details illness injury happiness etc
a	would like unhappy drivers to quit and join a rival
b	or injury after a crash to hinder performance

5	ability to arrange more complex pit stops
a	pit in 3 5 10 laps or if hamilton pits you pit etc

6	simulation mode  emergency builds that allow you to have a part made instantly is not realistic

7	pre  postrace interviews just thought of thiscould be fun

8	multiplayer

9	very limited options and controls especially around how and when to react to radio transmissions
a	would like to auto show replay of incidents especially with my own cars

10	keybind options  
a	we could have preset options saved and implemented with a single button press or voice activated
i	presetup options  
1	vsc configuration  safety car configuration
2	fastest lap config max everything for 1 full lap
3	protect your teammate
4	catch the car in front push hard for 13 laps until in drs range

11	ability to expand the information to additional screens like in the real f1 because there is so much data

12	realistic data fed information right now it seems basic and often generic instead of specific to each cardriver
a	talking delta and tyre degradation

#####

incredibly frustrating to realize that the game is constantly cheating the results i played more than 40 hours with mclaren and it was fascinating to finish 11th 6 times in a row i started paying very close attention to the actual lap times and the amount of bullshit rubberbanding the game will do is incredible in race after race the williams would lap faster than the ferraris and red bulls just to keep you exactly in the same gap from them they can get up top lapping one second faster than verstappen in worse tyres but hey that is what it takes to keep you from getting one point i tried the same race 4 times in a row with different strategies and can now see the pattern so clearly that i cannot play anymore last time i was on my way to p10 and 3 laps before the end the pilot crashes alone with no pressure and in an easy peasy straight i did nto get to feel like this in the previous game it was definitely easier on the ohter hand this game has the difficulty in the wrong places your decisions and strategy seem important but in reality they arent you make no differnce whatsoever the mclaren car is beyond shit piastri is beyond useless and no matter how much money you make the desing and manufcaturing keep bteaking down so aprat from the races being more or less predetermined the team management aspect is pretty shit as well very sad to see this so uninstalled and back to hoi4 where i can play anarchist world conquest in a much more believable fashion

#####

things that can make f1manager 2024 the perfect game
 my team mode
 play with formula 2 and 3 teams
 realistic pilot academy system
accelerated and optimized pilot and personnel development
integrated steam workshop facilitation of mods
that the scenarios bring races from past seasons eg abudhabi 2021 brazil 2012
cars with realistic colliders
better damage model
 best system of sanctions safety car and virtual
 to see how they remove the crashed cars
realistic piloting errors crashes blockages and more
 drivers license outside formula 1 palou oward vergne dennis etc
better weather
changes in cars even if they dont make sense
important changes in regulations standards and most frequent technological revolutions
old tracks that can return to the championship
that the ai uses the option to remove cars when it sees that a car is too far behind or with the car very damaged
random engine failures
types of team customer manufacturer motorist
traits for drivers eg paid driver who wins a championship and retires star driver
choice of suppliers of the cars base parts motorsport manager style
better management of sponsors
tv mode as in studio liverpool f1
single career as in f1 manager
 best view of the hq team headquarters
everything good about motorsport manager

b 215 hours played in f1m22 only 21 hours played in f1m23 and there will be no more b

i believed in frontier devs i was hoping they would fix next game but spoiler  no

i would like to express my support for ui designers they improved the already good ui design of last 22 game and visually game looks attractive thats nice

but programmers and game designers of this game their game is just slag simulation of the practice quali race ai teams and other remained just as terrible just awful already from stage 23 it just hurts you to play this game if you want some realistic stuff and some stuff with mods you cant fix that how that was possible in last year game i will never buy a game from these devs again and i will not advise you if they devs dont care so much about balance game testers for testing bugs or other stupid things and realism in a formula 1 game

1 balance its just terrible the cars like last year follow each other without any problems as a result in race 5 cars can easily fit in 1 second for several laps and drivers drives too sleek  spread is only 02s per lap by teammates and by several laps i mean if you have ocon and gasly with several skills you will have almost same lap time in quali 0002s dif and so it is in all fast laps attempts and in quali there is no evolution of the track no track evolution best lap time in q1 easily can be faster than in q3 but haha only for 0001 second i have no words there are still problems with balance but it looks like the devs just dont give a shit about it all

2 game mechanics personally im interested i like to tune the car but not all mechanics in game are good for example mechanics  driver control is controversial for example due to the lack of testers from devs i found one cheesing method in quali this works great for azerbaijan track  you have to push in advance before a fastlap just before long straight so your driver will be faster 0305s in fast lap ai dont do so as result youre cheater its cheating but its game problem devs problem not my i mean wtf frontier why you just not tested the game answer me please

3 ai just sucks it looks a little better than in last year game ai tyre strategies looks like little better but overall still sucks to be honest i dont see the point in explaining why if the devs dont give a shit about ai and other things and even more so i dont know why but there are fewer opportunities for modding for example to lower the slipstream drag drs effect tyres modding and so on if the devs did this intentionally then congratulations you have found a new enemy not a fan

im deleting the game from my pc i hope the sales of this game will be terrible like last time perhaps then devs will think about changing priorities but for some reason i dont believe it

#####

purchased this on sale thinking it would be a more advanced version of motorsports manager its not this game is a sad sad copy of motorsports manager that has less features and costs a ton because it has the f1 stamp on it

#####

start career as ferrari
1st race at bahrain completely dry middle of the desert
box for full wets with a 12 second pitstop

1010 for realism

we are checking

#####

devries crashed 4 times in 4 races very realistic

this game is a joke what a wasted opportunity to have this company getting the f1 license  last years game was bad but this one is much much worse not only does it have no new features basically but it keeps all the bad things from last years while making some others even worse this is made by people who dont understand f1 at all and it shows just a money grab

picture this you can have the fastest car on the grid and still be overtaken by alpines mclarens and even williams even though you have the same tyre and youre pushing as much as you can just becauseits random  i truly dont understand this would never happen in real life unless there was something very wrong with the car picture max with his dominant car all ok pushing as much as he can and being overtaken by a williams sounds ridiculous right well theres f1 manager 2023 for you

but theres more
blue flags are worthless as the ai is too bad to even let you through qualifying is a mess because again the ai will block you and wont let you do your lap sure this happens in real life but not 10x per weekend

you can also have absurd things like your two drivers having a delta as big as 1sec per lap i had sainz and leclerc same confidence level same setup satisfaction same strategy sainz p1 and leclerc 25 seconds behind lapping almost 1sec slower per lap why what were they thinking

not to mention ridiculous stuff such as on my first save pérez absolutely destroying max and winning the wcc or smaller teams voting for an increase on the budget cap for the bigger teams nothing makes sense at all like i said it was a game made by people who know absolutely nothing about f1 just watched drive to survive and decided to make a game
i mean this is the team that recently released a statement calling alfa romeo alpha romeo there are only 10 teams and the grid and yet they cant even spell them right its crazy 

please let some other devs get the license this game has so much potential i really wanted to like it but it sucks and i seriously regret giving them my money please dont do the same or theyll never learn

#####

9 hours into getting rid of lawrence stroll would 1010 make aston and williams great again

#####

the only thing more ridiculous than the state of this game is the fact that i fell for it again next year dont listen to the countless previews that will tell you that issue x has been fixed because it wont have been a yearly licensed release like any other

#####

this game is brimming with potential as a lifelong championship manager into football manager fan im very familiar with the development cycle of new features and timeline it takes for a game to reach its maturity so im willing to overlook the odd bit here and there

lets kick this off though with some positive feedback for frontier

1 graphically this is wonderful the races the camera views the gui in that part of the game is really well thought out and i thoroughly enjoy sitting back and watching the race in real time id dreamt of something like this for fm football manager for years but it just doesnt work for them  it works here and its your secret sauce

2 its somewhat consistent red bull dominate and its tough being another team chasing them and its not been easy trying to build my team ferrari up to them either  and it shouldnt be either kudos for making the challenge big enough

so some feedback

 the render of the drivers in the menu is a long way off the graphics of the actual race it should either be on par with it or do not bother until it is

 its probably on the roapmap but extending this game out to extend to managing in f2 and f3 could be excellent if youre a team principal climbing up the leagues itll give more longevity to the experience

 on that point  create a team its a must for the future and i realise it could be complicated because of how the car might look but with todays design abilities i see no reason why you can create a pool of fake sponsors branded like real companies to decorate your car with and a limited but functional design screen to get things like uniforms right i really think this experience is worth investing ingenuity into because having the a rich benefactor has asked if you would like to be team principal for a new f1 team is a whole other dynamic to entering the sport

 the research for next year system is a little primitive and confusing at this point and potentially needs a better graphical representation to show where the car needs to be in future seasons with new regs versus where your research currently is

 the car adjustments and set ups could simultaneously be more complicated and sophisticated but also need simplification to explain  i think the fine margins could be expanded upon in the way you set up for a car how much to warm tires by different fuelling strategies in race  heavy but push lighter but conserve etc for the hardcore i feel this gives different increments to exploit but for the casual id suggest that more assistant based advice could help simplify car complexities on recommended setups as a novice to this game but not this genre i picked up enough quickly but it still feels largely like guess work its an area i think requires exploring

look ive written a long review the point is im enjoying it its a bit primitive in its form right now but im excited by its potential and its beautiful to watch a race thank you for the effort  please take on board what some fans think could help this grow  even if im wrong in my points im sure f1 fans everywhere will help shape this into a truly aaa game  if you listen to them

cheers

#####

fool me once shame on you 

fool me twice

frontier is the developmental equivalent of a nigerian prince trying to get in contact with you to send you 300m 

these incompetent imbeciles should be nowhere near game development that isnt themepark related theyre a onetrick pony and shockingly so

#####

if this was a patch for f1 manager 2022 i could maybe accept it but its really not worth the money in its current state 
its buggy the ai is just as janky as last years game 

motorsport manager was so much better than this crap they are pumping out

#####

just play f1 manager 2022 its the same exact game

#####

 

 this game is 
on pc game 
 pass


dont buy it


 



#####

very realistic max wins 24 seconds ahead of 2nd

#####

very large improvement over the 2022 version

pros
ai much improved  examples ai doing laps before rain hits in qualifying ai pitting for late safety cars even if the strategy they were originally on could make it to the end ai actually uses ers fuel modes pushes tyres etc makes it much more enjoyable when racing ai also improves their cars as fast as you do

tyre temperatures are actually a thing plus the temperature of the track and the air can affect your tyre temps quite a lot i had a 15 degrees celsius practice session in australia and even when going aggressive on the tyres they would never overheat however when the temperature hits 30 its totally different you have to go light on the tyres every so often to not have them overheat i havent experienced extremes beyond these two yet but they can happen

way harder than the previous version you will definitely hit the cost cap easily if you arent careful you cant spam intense or emergency parts anymore without taking a massive chunk out of the money you can spend ai develops cars as fast as you you need to fiddle around with the sliders when designing car parts as potentially leaving it on balanced wont allow you to catch up to the other cars as fast as you would like maybe focus on dirty air tolerance one time maybe drs effectiveness another time maybe engine cooling another time etc seems more logical right now right now i am last with alfa romeo in imola with zero points and my target is 7th well see if i get sacked or not but it definitely helps upgrading the board room for extra board confidence and not going into the red money wise

old sprint races could be a negative as it isnt the new sprint shootout format but i cant blame them for not having it as it was implemented too late for them to react 

they have the new quali format used in imola cancelled irl so that was moved to monza i believe and hungary hards in q1 medium in q2 soft in q3 nice to see

emergency events i have a had a few of these where you have to make a decision examples being faults in a department and you need to either shut the whole thing down resulting in 10 days where you cant manufacture parts etc or you risk it and hope it doesnt get worse another being conflict between driver and engineer you can intervene and potentially make things better or worse or you leave it be and cause the driver to be more aggressive in race and loose affinity between driver and engineer these events have made my save so much harder too as i have lost a lot of time being able to upgrade the car at certain races because i couldnt manufacture parts for days its a great addition

cons
i had a race in baku where there was 3 red flags in the first 20 laps or so the race eventually finished after about 2 and a half hours of ingame racing however i noticed the weather didnt update after a certain amount of time the weather and the temps stayed the same for over half the race maybe they dont simulate far enough right now or the red flags bugged it out not sure hope they fix that

no mechanical failures

maybe too many racing incidents especially in practice with collisions happening between drivers too frequently however that could make up for no mechanical failures in the game not that much of a big deal as it spices up the races

ai maybe too fast at the beginning of races havent played enough to see if its a reoccurring thing as your car gets better will update as time goes on

conclusion
its hard to note every positive and negative off the top of my head but i will  update if i remember some its a fantastic game and a massive improvement over the first i actually have so much more fun in this game than the last and the saves will be fun for a longer period of time be prepared for a challenge in race and out of the race ai better temps noticeably make a difference

910 for me personally last game was probably a 5 because of how boring it got quickly into a save no longer the case in this game

edit i am now finding a new job at the job centre wish me luck

#####

im literally mattia binotto

#####

same game as previous year very disappointing this game needs some real depth also there are still bugs present now in its current state that i was experiencing from day one after release i stopped playing for a few months in the hope that the bugs would have been rectified please fix the frozen screen during a race then you lose all progress for the race very annoying i feel like this game has so much potential but concerned due to the current state this may cause issues for future games i hope the next one really takes off

#####

its like a simplified version of motor sport manager with an f1 theme 

a my team mode would set it apart and make it more interesting hopefully we see it in the next iteration of the game

610 over all was hoping for something different if you havent played motorsport manager then this would be a good choice if youve played motorsport manager this might be a skip for now

anyway this is a upgrade from the old one one of the best manager game but i hope to see new features like coop carrer or build your team

#####

still having the same problems as last year and not really new stuff was added
there is no point in doing quali because the ai cant move to the side properly and if you dont have a lap without a car in front of you its 2 seconds slower and in quali is 0 track evolution which makes no sense at all

#####

after trying for a long time to love this gamei find myself playing it less than what i did f1 manager 22 yes they did improve a few aspects but it feels more like a chore now than ever and i think regardless of what people say here that a majority of people feel the same way with f1 manager 22 i saw many long drawn out career mode youtube videos long after the game was released with 23 it seems the buzz dried out very quickly this game feels more like an expansion or a large update rather than an upgrade to the base game
now i cant put my finger on a single aspect that seems to grind me the wrong way it just seems that in the search for more realism the game has forgottenits a game its supposed to be fun with 22 i went thru many seasons with 23 i have yet to complete a single one i get bored with it faster and the races feel more and more like a chore i loath getting into and ill address the elephant in the room i was hoping that 23 would finally have create a team something that would make the chore at least  more personal and get me investedbut as we all know that was never added and theres talk that it might not make it into f1 manager 24 
i recently went back and replayed motorsports manager a game that f1 manager highly copied from the ui to the options to the way most things are done except that game still remembers its a game its meant to be fun they added create a team after launch they added different racing types other than f1 you can start in what essentially is f3 unlike f1 manager 
maybe im just getting old and jaded but even the main f1 series suffers alot from the same issue its a great simbut its just not fun i would love to see the developers get away from the whole sim idea and maybe get into a more story driven experience sort of like the main f1 series did id like to make the game more personal more interaction and choices to make custom teamshell custom drivers maybe we could make our own driver and play as a driver and not the manager maybe you could allow your staff to actually do their jobs and run their departments based on their stats instead of micromanaging them to death
theres so much that could be done with this franchise that would make them the only ones doing anything like itbut i dont see these developers taking a chance and doing anything outside of small changes year over year thats why alot of people dont see even create a team coming any time soon something that could have and should have been patched in by now
overall id give this game a 610 its better than an average sim but not by much and i cant recommend it to people new to the genre or game

#####

same as last year game is quite fun but seems very unpolished and devs are already playing dead after two minor updates buying for half price seems like a clever choice if you really want to try licensed f1 management game otherwise play motorsport manager

#####

shameless cash grab yearly release

#####

great improvements over last year fun new ideas  mechanics
yet still a playtest at time of release  real basic ui bugs that are hard to forgive for a seasonal title of this magnitude
pls improve qa and remove denuvo while youre at it seems half the resources the game needs stem from it

still great fun with obstacles  nothing like it out there
wont recommend atm tho especially at the price point
buy  discount

#####

i give a thumbs up because there is no middle ground no maybe or perhaps just yes or no

better than f1 manager 22 however its still far from being a proper finished product is it still fun yes but i feel thats because there is nothing else to compare it to yes there is motorsport manager which is a great title but its dated and needs modernising therefore for me mm isnt really comparable

the ingame improvements for f1 man23 are numerous but really should have been applied to the previous game rather than charging euro4050 and branded as a new game way too pricey for what we are getting then you are asked for 1015 more to get special scenarios when to be fair 15 for the updates reskins  23 roster as an expansion would have been far more fitting but like most game developers today the mantra less is more seems to be the standard especially when you see how many are spitting their dummies passifiers out of the buggy over baldurs gate 3 larian should be applauded for their moral stance and belief

anyway if you dont own an f1 sim you could buy this but if money is short get motorsport manager 
if you already own last years fare maybe skip this unless you really must have the ai improvements or at least wait until it is heavily discounted

#####

was this game a bit of a disappointment at launch yes it was like all games now but it has gotten better adding things like a difficulty settings and it is fun as an avid f1 fan ive had a great time you can create your own story like i took over merc so practically replacing toto so i let hamilton go and brought mick in after the first two seasons of a 3rd fastest car slog finally we were the fastest but mick couldnt keep it out of the wall and russell just couldnt match maxs pace championship came down to the last race max had had terrible form after crashing last couple races we needed a win came down to the last three laps but max sent it up the inside of russell and didnt look back i was crushed now season 4 begins

there are definitely things i would love to see included like a much better stat data base im an f1 fan after a few seasons i will want to see who came in p5 in the 1st austrian gp i will want to see how each season came out for instants i think something like football manager has with its crazy stat database other things i want to see are things from changing garage position to championship finishing order to being able to adapt my own teams engines hopefully 2026 maybe also missing a myteam mode in a manager game is a crazy miss even a driver editorcreator do i want to live out my f1 dream in this game yes please but we can only wait and see for now this game will do

#####

new camera views updated graphics and drivers and lots of bugs what a great value for money for  70 dollars not this is just a dlc for fm 2022 frontier developments are lazy even fifa puts more new stuff in there games each year and thats saying something dont get sucked in by this wait for a sale

#####

rather wait till f1manger2050 if this the model they going to use to release new gamesupdates 
they have an opportunity to improve the ai instead of just  adding easy or hard where is all the money going thats the problem with these big studio programs they put all the money in marketing and not in making good long lasting products rather play motorsport manager
i love f1 manger but they doing us dirty next is pay to win now wacth


#####

compared to 2022 edition this is worse very small changes and more anoying bugs

example of bugs is if you change qualifying laps you cant send them out again before changing tires wasting time also changing fuel load and loading in a save will show wrong fuel numbers and you cant fix it
fuel load also mean nothing ferrai is unrealisticly quick and relieable
if you change a driver etc etc redbull and haas hass will instantly be a podium contender and randomizing the entire grid no matter the cars capabilities which means developing drivers sucks specially the new way where you cant choose

setup is always the same and yet you cant preset the setup for each circuit nono you have to redo it every time it rains waaay too often and then when it does it has no impact on strategy because the rain will stay entire race and all ai will do the exact same thing so cant even outsmart you just have to do what everyone else does

the game is way too expensive and you dont even get those special scenarioes in the base version

#####

very cool game its very realistic because logan sargent fvks up every race definitely recommend

#####

lots of game crashes
pit crew development needs work very difficult to keep your crew from deteriorating let alone get better
lots of red flags
too frequent negative random events with car production facilities i have like 2 fires per year if that happened in a real facility it would be closed down forever
safety car at the end of the race results in a car that was in last place getting credit for a win just tons of bugs a sad step down from last years game

#####

i dont often write reviews but they bastardised one of my favourite sports so i feel compelled to
properly lazy developers dont even understand the basics of what theyre supposed to be simulating
race weekend formats are wrong for sprint weekends its embarrassing
tyre allocation is non existent
my factory keeps catching fire wind tunnel keeps having structural issues every year without fail even though its maxed out level 5
every year without fail piastri has a row with his engineer and loses loads of affinity and confidence
my car was fastest on stats by a mile but no matter what you cannot win the 1st 3 races for some reason in 2nd or 3rd season
ai strategy is to just push for the first stint on max but if i do that my tyres melt so i end up going backwards with a superior car
pit crew development is awful ruins the whole race aspect of the game as the crew get so tired so quick bless them
no more development points for drivers or staff the drivers stats are wrong apparently piastri is no good but gasly is 
work that out
there are a plethora of other issues like team balancing and car development rate that are inaccurate

all in all i wouldnt buy it as its on game pass free and even then its not really worth playing

totally disappointed to be honest total lack of knowledge of the subject by the developers
they should be embarrassed

#####

overall a good game not much change from the last one main annoyance is having to manage the ers obviously a skill issue which ill improve overtime feel like they could massively expand the reach of this game by adding options for the more casual of players 

options to add 
drivers manage their own ers
drivers mange their own fuel load and tyres
each driver has a rating to determine how well they manage their fueltyresers 

if theyve added this ability so i could play more casually and just focus on the management side of pitstops and improving the car then id get more enjoyment from this game

#####

forget 22 this is what should have been released

#####

just finished a season  no drivers or constructors championship celebrations crappy generic trophies for race wins still  desperate need of graphic overhaul  ripoff  its like f1 manger 22 with 2023  dlc  not good enough  will not rush to buy 24 unless its like 1799  cars look like last years  lazy like madden franchise sad

#####

i like this game but i suggest buying the game in a steam sale like when it is in an offer

#####

hard to not recommend a game i put over 500 hours into really play this if you too want to experience watching verstappen win every race while your plebs crash into each other and your factory sets itself on fire once a year it is a good game though

#####

h1f1 manager 23  run away as far as you possibly canh1

at this point in time the game is a waste of money you will get more enjoyment watching your money burn than by playing this game
as of writing the ai is not required to run different sets of tires during a race while you are and get penalized if you run the same sort of tyre compound all race
at the start of the season red bull will lose 115 seconds per lap to ferrari and mercedes  in reality its the other way around
the interface has a more cleaned up look but requires a lot more clicks to get around than last years iteration car part development has been made more complex for no apparent reason
driver faces still look like they only consist of three different polygons

all in all get last years version on sale and save some money only pay for this game if you can get it for cheap on a sale and do not own the previous iteration otherwise run away from it as far as you can

#####

this is a fun game its replayability isnt great though after playing f1 manager 2022 for a few seasons i bought this game and only found it interesting for about 2 seasons with a midfield team retried a campagin with red bull racing at the highest difficulty settings which in my mind do nothing but set you back in terms of pace i dont see smarter strategic choices by other teams like the developers announced just more pace which is a bit meh if you ask me when you get the hang of this game it becomes a bit stale because a lot of stuff that you can do becomes more or less obsolete if you just get the few things right that you need to progress still a fun game to try if you havent played its predecessor dont expect hours and hours of fun though

#####

i loved f1 manager 22 and i am a huge fan of f1 and f1 manager games and i appreciate frontier for striving to bring back a fully licensed game but this is absolutely unplayable in the current state 
i probably wont receive my refund since i have over 2h of playtime in which i probably spent half of it reopening the game after crashes or not being able to call in my drivers to pit or bugged ai cars crashing in practice when instructions are to not drive aggressively 

even if you love the game and f1 managers this game will frustrate you more than please you wait for patches to go on a sale whatever over 50 usd for this unfinished game is just outrageous

edit as ive said  waiting for patches and sales the game is now much better after the updates hence reverting my review to a yes i now recommend it

#####

sorry its got to be no from me until they fix some of the major bugs like strategy window during race which means you have to quit teams not using  two compounds course pit entry bugs etc

if they fix bugs would say games 6070 rating and shows more promise than last version but then again thats not a high bar to pass

#####

i havent had this much fun with a manager game since motorsport manager i put over 100 hours in that and can see myself putting in the same with this much better than last years game by far only issue is before every race when i hit the button to advance to the race itself the game crashes only once but its once before every race

#####

still has further room to grow but a positive step in the right direction

#####

i had been playing motorsport manager for a couple of years now and having a blast with it  once i got my new laptop i figure i would give this game a try  for the most part i am really enjoying this game  the graphics and sounds are really good  since it is licensed by formula 1 i dont have to download mods to get the real drivers teams tracks and cars like mm

however it is not without its cons  the graphics are really good except for crashes  the crash sequences remind me of games from the 1990s  all a crash shows is some small squares coming off the car as it hits another car or the wall  if the car has front wing damage it will show the car with a damaged front wing  but for the most part the car looks like it is in the same condition after hitting the wall as it does sitting in the garage

another thing i would like to see is to simulate the rest of a session  i would like to be able to start a practice session or race and then in the middle of the session simulate the rest  also i would like to be able to simulate a race

i would also like to be able to save clips of the race ie overtakes and crashes or have a highlights reel at the end of the race

the last thing this game doesnt have that is included in mm is a listing of the grid before the start of the race  it lists the qualifying rankings but not a revised grid after the grid penalties are applied

overall i enjoy this game  on a scale of 1 to 10 i would give it a high 7 or an 8  better more realistic crash sequences would definitely make me rate the game higher

#####

imagine this youre a busy semifunctional adult you have no real room for a permanent racing rig because your dysfunctional family keeps hoarding worthless garbage and trinkets but still blames poverty despite actively seeing a therapist milking their health insurance you still need your f1 fix to fill the middle class void in your life because actual race weekends cant come fast enough to make you forget f1 manager lets you play in economy class on a plane on your 5 year old 4k tv in the er waiting room at your parents house between high stress tinder messages you name it

#####

its a fair bit more in depth than the previous game watch some video tutorials about managing your cost cap its a lot less forgiving than in f1m22  
the sprint weekends kind of suck but save before p1 and note your setups reload after every p1 to get 100 on the setup
i do love the helmet view 
it crashes more often than f1m22
being able to hire someone for next season is a great feature
yeah be aware that there are many levels of menus to find settings to adjust to your benefit

#####

i actually have more fun playing this game than watching f1

#####

verstappen is still winning but good game nonetheless


#####

i would wait until the next game all the features bought to the new game shouldve been in the first one the devs will most likely dump the game in a few months i cant recommend this at full price this game feels more like a soft dlc to the first one we cant be happy to see fundamental features of an f1 management style game added in the second one when it should be there from the start game is missing soo may features  however alot of improvements have been made here overall which is always welcomed but also underwhelming for a full priced release please do be weary of the dlc and prices for what youre going to get

#####

a 55  game wich is only a bad update from last year version some good ideas though but no 

you get 5 sec penalty if someone crash in you from behind nevermind what happens in fact penalty is for you

your race engineer will also announce to your pilot he has a penalty if anyone makes an infraction somewhere on the track hopefully the penalty is finally not for your pilot but this is such an amateurism

confidence is somewhat a good idea but as your driver start to lose it by making a mistake being overtaked failing to overtake its extremely hard to regain some sometimes so he will continuously losing confidence and the more he lose confidence the more he makes mistakes and so on and finally he can become a shaking fragile baby we are speaking of the best drivers in the world

devs dont know f1 rules  in rl paddock garages are attributed according to last seasons constructor ranking it can be very important in quali as it defines priority in the pitlane if your car is still in the garage youll have to wait for the cars on the pitlane to go on to be allowed to join the lane

also ai cars dont apply the rule saying you must use at least 2 different tyre compounds while racing in dry conditions so ai can go full soft an entire race i had haas doing softsoftsoft on my first race while i was doing softmediumsoft its ridiculous

for some reason your pilots will jump on the brakes if they are at full speed on track near the end of the pitlane and if an ai car is rejoining the track close to them very funny in qualis and in race you will love it so polite guys

also in quali stupid ai on slow lap in or out lap will stay on the racing line in every corner maaaaaan it is so frustrating as 1 of these idiots will make you lose 3 secs at least on your fast lap yeah your stupid pilot will slow down and follow the bugger until the end of the corner or worse until the end of the serie of corners

there is no social interaction between your pilots and you or your team i wonder what would happen if redbull asked max to let checo pass im sure he would comply immediatly or you as team principal and the board no press no medias no paddock rumors it feels artificial
edit  it finally happened that i was warned about tensions between one of my drivers and his race engineer i had just a choice to let it go or intervene both could result on worse or better issue i intervened and had a report that my driver gained in morale ok
and there was some sort of media article about the 1st part of the season thats all

tv speakers commentaries in french are terrible really its an awful joke youll never believe it one second breaks the immersion

if you play a motorist team you cannot improve engine i know engines are freezed but motorists are allowed to improve reliability

graphics are ok menus are meh too much clicks to get an info or to replace a part could be optimised car crashes are weirds

all in all its not a bad game but its not a good game neither it definitly not worth the price tag 55 is a shame considering the poor work wich has be done on it really i feel scamed it worth no more than 25 if you have last year iteration stick with it with mods and wait for a better game than this

#####

toto wolff simulator

#####

if you played f1 manager 22 you will quickly see that this game has been improved in almost every way although 22 was really good as well f1 manager 23 refines pretty much everything about it aside from a few ui decisions that i felt were a step backwards

especially the new ers system and the driver preparation are awesome changes
not to mention the parts durability which was missing entirely in 22

anyone who liked 22 will probably like this one even better

#####

one of the best simulation games ive played recently became a fan of f1 during this past season and this is a ton of fun easy 100 completion as well

#####

i love tanking red bull

#####

good game but pretty much a carbon copy of f1 22 with a few added features i hate the fact in the sprint races you just seem to constantly fall down places down to poor driving and the qualifying is just broken still i like the fact you have to upgrade the car but no matter what team you go its impossible to keep up with the ai teams game has a few little bugs as well would wait for the sale to come around as this is a lazy effort in my opinion

#####

good game overall but some issues that hamper gameplay namely

 driver morale being rather underdeveloped and opaque drivers in the middle of a battle will flip flop between being happy that they gained a position and being sad that they lost one often ending up at a lower morale than they started with
 replays seem to be a bit janky the button appearing at incorrect times and sometimes not even showing the accident
 camera angles arent always that great especially on certain tracks where you cant actually see whats going on half the time i understand its meant to replicate the reallife cameras but id love an option to just get an overhead view or at the very least a helicam a super zoomed out view like the one at x16 speed showing the actual cars battling would also be awesome
 theres no way to let the driverrace engineer handle the micro management of their pace ers modes etc would be nice to have an option to let them handle it autonomously
 lack of being able to pick sponsors
 facility management feels shallow

these are all issues that could be solved in future updates but dont buy something on the promise of what it couldwill be cough tesla selfdriving cough if youre a big f1 fan and are prepared to spend 60 on a fun time then go ahead and buy it if youre still on the fence then maybe hold off until you know for certain whether or not its a game thats for you

#####

i dont want to write this about f1 manager 2023 because i know how hard it is to make a game and deal with licenses and everything but at the same time i feel like warning people that this is one to avoid

good things about f1 manager 2023 

 fully licensed has every circuit and driver plus sprint events 

 graphics are decent 

 tyre strategy is sometimes fun undercuts and overcuts can work sometimes and its satisfying to pull off a good race when the game doesnt do outrageous things like have every single one of your pitstops in a race last 8 seconds apiece

bad things 

 drivers constantly crash in practice sessions play for a few hours and you too will notice that yuki tsunoda and oscar piastri are torpedoes 

 crofty and karuns commentary just seems out of place why bother even putting them in when they sound like those ai voices off tiktok

 this game is heavily weighed down by its licenses no fake sponsors recruiting drivers outside f1 feeder series no pay drivers 

 stewards are hilariously bad and theres no way to challenge them ive been penalised for some crazy stuff like my driver being hit by another one whos not even alongside them which is the rule 

worst thing 

 the game is too punishing with pit stop mistakes and lockups and driver crashes within races yet its also too easy because this is essentially a game about busywork setting up your car adjust some sliders until they get within a set range by the game that only makes sense about half the time improving your car adjust some sliders until number goes up its so boring and depressing to think about the busywork that im now going to uninstall it

#####

buggy devs dont care

#####

karun chadnok comes out with the most horrifc and questionable comments possible and crofty just says what he wants this game is amazing 1010

#####

i had high hopes being a huge f1 fan and having played motorsport manager in the past id say this is a downgrade from mm aside from having better visuals everything else seems dumbed down and not nearly as immersive you dont even get to modify your livery design or negotiate for sponsorships which have been a feature in mm for years also there is a gamebreaking bug that is well document since launch that the devs have refused to fix sometimes mid race if you go to a strategy window youre not able to get back into seeing the race and you just get stuck in a menu limbo hell that doesnt allow you to do anything while the race is still ongoing you have to quit the game and restart the entire race to fix the issue this has been a document bug for almost a year now how has this not been fixed

#####

this is not a manager game in even a little bit this is sold in its current state as a arcade game all you have to do is cheese to win there are no meaningful changes to your car or driver line up except maybe you will get a amazing lance stroll who will lap verstappen after the 1st year of development or piastri who will spin and bin it every race because he is so low rated clearly this game was not made out of love or it wouldent feel like a dlc for the first game

ps why in the name of all the greek gods have you still not added create your own team or 2 player online career is just beyond me at this point add somthing meaningful or show some love to the game or i for one will never be purchasing from this devoloper again

#####

its actually a lot better than last years game it doesnt feel like a buggy mess straight from the start only bad bug ive encountered is a car ghosting through another but other than that its a lot better and actually enjoyable off launch

#####

same as last years game no real improvement ai still sucks still no depth dont waste your money

#####

gotta love when piastri crashes in practice 1 spend money to replace all the broken parts then he crashes again the next session and destroys literally everything including the new parts that were only just put in so not even halfway through the season im close to the cost cap due to my drivers just crashing all the time and having to replace engines ers and gearbox every race weekend thought i would enjoy it but for now im not enjoying it as much as i hoped

still terrible

#####

 pretty much the same game again
 crashing to bsod bugs
 no support for ultra wide
 nyck de vries
 confidence stat just does not make sense
 parts degrading does not make sense
 guaranteed and not penalised impeding during qualifying does not make sense
 lazy devs
 race ended 1 lap earlier with my driver being second then i see celebrations of my driver winning the race wtf
 finally proper menu music

#####

this game is so real i feel like im bringing a spoon to a gun fight

#####

wait for the next patch to see what gets fixed and then decide to buy my current observations

1 op ai drivers at race start safety car restart cars  drivers with lower performance and rating go past higher ranked rated drivers on 1 step lower tyres
2 not enough lap time penalty when tyres overheat ai tends to abuse this and run at full tilt constantly
3 ai has endless fuel  tyre ers to keep pushing constantly
4 ai drivers still go for a second lap in q1 when in p1p3
5 ai drivers will go for second lap on inters when the first lap in that session was on soft so there is no way or chance of improving on either inters or wets
6 time penalty always give to the wrong driver 
7 not sure if the battle assist mode helps in lap time or defending

i guess thats enough for now

#####

the game has had a lot of improvements mainly refinement of the base game we had in 2022

cost cap now matters ai is a lot better they really vary their strategy and are generally more intelligent development is better as you wont just fly up the grid

still bugs and niggles here and there such as in my opinion the ai are far to fast on worn tyres 

would recommend though

#####

motorsport manager still way better than this i expected more from the game its the second version too so many problems and way less features please take a look and maybe copy some things from motorsport manager

#####

it is certainly an improvement from f1 manager 22 

i have noticed that i have to really understand the mechanics a lot more in every way this is largely due to the cost cap being much more of a consideration than the previous title i have to be more scrupulous with the capital that i outlay does it actually provide me with enough roi for me to dump a whole lot of cash into a specific building upgrade or am i better off using that money to allocate to another intense design project to increase my teams expertise this has certainly made it a lot more engaging than its predecessor

also i specifically love all of the timely bumps in the road as i am forced into a snap decision of whether i really need that part as an emergency for the next race and then wince as i see the amount get taken off the cost cap 

keep up the good work and keep making a game where you think the majority of your decisions actually matter

#####

this game forces me to become an f1 fan

no regrets

tu tu tu tu max verstappen

#####

i dived into f1 manager 2023 with the excitement of a pit crew prerace only to find myself drowning in menus instead of champagne showers while the visor cam offers a thrilling peek into the cockpit the real racing action felt like a spectator sport

management the core of this genre is surprisingly shallow sure you tinker with parts and fuel but the impact feels minimal compared to the micromanagement thrills of other management games heck i played 10 indie management sims in 2004 that offered more engaging gameplay loops than this

f1 2023 with its actual racing and deeper control ironically provides a more satisfying management experience here youre not just pulling levers youre feeling the car the gforces the strategic heartbeat of every decision

if you crave the thrill of running an f1 team f1 manager 2023 might leave you feeling like a pit stop gone wrong for the same price you could grab a copy of f1 2023 and actually get to play both sides of the pit wall

#####

did some insane upgrades strats organized the team and mclaren was running like a well oiled machine under your boy

turn 3 nyck de vries slams into piastri and norris had his car explode

refunded

#####

we are checking

#####

the game is essentially the exact same as last year just with updated drivers  however one thing which is different to last year is that there are so many bugs this year that realistically shouldnt be happening when it took them this long to release the game when its already the same as last year nearly every other race ive had to restart the game as when pop ups for pit stops or weather warnings or even safety cars come up you cant get rid of them off of the screen  therefore not being able to continue with the current race and having to start over from your last save they still havent sorted out overtakes or tyre wear from last year  theyre honestly exactly the same as what they were and drivers still have no idea how to properly overtake or they get stuck behind when theyre so close to the car infront absoulte joke when theyve had this long to fix last years game just get motorsport manager and get the f123 mod as its a much better game and has way better simulations

#####

its extremely buggy for me personally ive had a ton of issues tryna launch it and then after the bahrain gp on my saves it has told me my data has corrupted something about verifying installations i cant say that everyone will get this but reinstalling didnt work at all i had to make a completely new save  it took me about 3040 minutes to actually get the game to launch to begin with as well now most of my problems have been fixed which is great and its really nice to see the developers actually interested in sorting everything out the only actual problem i have with it at the moment is sometimes it will crash maybe once a race weekend if i get lucky then maybe once every two race weekends but overall its a decent game once all of the bugs get ironed out however my view on the game has changed significantly although there are still a few bugs to iron out a lot of the major ones have been fixed now my only other say really is the ai 99 of the time completely fuck over your laps in qualifying because they quite simply cannot get out the way of your cars and just simply block them and in some cases make them loose a few tenths to a second of a lap

#####

this game should never have been released in its current state with the number of bugs and crashes the worst of which affects the whole gameplay  while other teams are free to use soft tyres for the whole race without penalty your team must abide by the rules and work under the restricted access to tyres meaning you are inevitably disadvantaged  it looks as though it only happens on the first race of the season but game crashes follow to spoil the fun further  i have kept going and just accept the shortcomings just because it is genuine f1 and great to play in that world but the developers must surely give greater consideration to customers when releasing full price games with flaws like these   on the plus side they are active in trying to resolve the issues but until then be warned that all is not well and the season will be compromised as you play
update still of the same opinion after doubling my game time  it feels as if this game was rushed and has too many little things that dont work yet still happy to say the game is great as the attachment to real f1 games gives a good feeling and this has the potential to be huge once it has the hiccups sorted  looking forward to the devs progressing it

#####

unbelievable how broken the game is worse than last years game so many things that need addressing and none of the new features are worth anything still getting blocked on your qualifying laps making upgrades on car but your car then somehow goes slower than before game needs sorting out fast

#####

its hard to recommend this game given that the graphics do not correlate with what is actually going on or going to happen there has been no real improvement since this game was released in 2022 the rng thats under the hood controls everything but not in a natural way the graphics will show you rapidly approaching the back of another car and indeed sometimes clipping into them or though other track elements in monaco with no damage to your car or their the ais car i cant tell you how many times ive flinched because i was sure that my car going into the back of the other car was going to cause the mother and father of all accidents but sometimes there is an impossible slow down of the car or they do touch but that information is not put back into the game engine for it to handle

the weekend formats are often wrong spa weekend is an example of this where p1 and q123 did not happen on the friday sq and sprint race did not happen on the saturday while i know that was sort of a last minute change there is an overall problem that the game engine clearly isnt up to the task of being an f1 game at all

all of that does not even touch the subject of all of the crashes null pointer exceptions happening in every gaming sessions sometimes multiple times is frankly unacceptable and goes to show the inexperience of the team that is making this game they should frankly lose their license to the f1 games and someone  anyone else  should pick it up because the concept is solid but the execution is flawed this coupled with the cash grab that was the last game with the dev team leaving players with no updates around 100 days after release does not give me much hope that this game will go in the correct direction

if you care at all about your sanity pass on this game unless youre a purely hard core f1 fan and need something to do over the summer break

6 more hours in after this review and the game and its saved files have corrupted themselves got a safety car in a race that paused the game for the radio message and now the game will not unpause itself i tried loading from a saved game state and all that happens is that i reload into the safety care situation and the game is still paused im unable to unpause the game at all 60 hours of game play will be lost this is disappointing but hardly unexpected given its current form wait a few months before picking up this game for cheap its acceptable if it didnt have these kinds of bugs and was at least half the price it is

#####

not as in depth as motorsport manager so if you are looking for something like that this may not be for you however the game still brings much to the table a huge improvement over last years game although it would be hard to not be both the on and off track parts of the game are interesting and entertaining and the official f1 license makes it really fun to race around your favorite tracks with your favorite teams and drivers of course the game isnt perfect it does have its issues like penalties being applied incorrectly and issues with drivers not fully warming up on automatic quali yet to be patched as of patch 15 however devs have said fixes are on the way but i feel the majority of these reviews are incredibly harsh i believe that should this game go on sale fans of f1 and racing gamessims should buy this game

#####

very similar to last years game which i enjoyed a few new features keep things interesting the main feature im looking forward to seeing is the team switching but i havent got far enough to use that yet id give this a solid 810

now that ive tried the switch teams feature it definitely adds longevity to the game without having to start a save from scratch

#####

its ok decent fun really not the easiest game to win i find but if you like f1 you should like this one

#####

dont get this in quali the ai will block you and they wont get a penalty for impeding get motorsport manager instead with the f1 season mods

#####

everything has improved a lot from last years game and i like that theyve added the feature to switch teams race replays scenarios and game difficulty really enjoying it

#####

nice

#####

not sure how they managed to just copy and paste last years game and  introduce so many game breaking bugs  ive had to altf4 out of three races so far because switching data views bricks the whole ui and makes so you cant click anything  they also didnt make any improvements from last year  the practice sessions are worthless as car setups dont improve your pace at all 

driver attributes are a huge crap shoot as well  im managing mclaren and despite oscar staying competitive with lando this season he qualifies p19 or p20 every race  before my last race crashed after two laps oscar was 2 seconds behind devries in p20

in short the game this year is an absolute joke and its clear the devs are just cashing a check from f1 and dont actually care to make a decent product given they just stamped a fresh coat of paint on last years game and called it good

stay away from this franchise as i would be willing to bet by october an announcement will come that they are dropping support to work on f1 manager 2024

#####

i was skeptical because of the bad reviews actually this is better version of the last year game with a lot of improvement in management a nice improvement even if very far from perfect of tires management on track a revived market and overall a better experience soo i hope to see a new title this year with more improvement and more challnges

#####

its half cool and half unfinished keep crashing and i see a lot of bugs when selecting amount of fuel to bring on a car and nerf ocon he always crash on me

#####

this game feels more as a dlc or a big update as it barely brings anything new except for sprint races and some other small things that were missing in 2022
it feels that the developers are lazy something we saw in f1 manager 2022 as well

 qualifying is still bad 
 the game randomly crashes when loading into a race hopefully this will be fixed with a upcoming patch
 managing part is still very limited compared to for example football manager

is it worth getting this game for the amount of money 
if you are new to this game and it will be your first f1 manager game then go for it if you have f1 manager 2022 then stick to that

there is a different way into buying this game without full price on a different website i would definitely suggest to use that option instead as in my opinion f1 manager 2022 and 2023 are both too expensive for the content it gives

#####

garbage same as last year same as next year

#####

just play f1 manager 22 instead they have messed up every major aspect of the game and it is very unenjoyable

#####

pretty good

#####

the devs had some interesting ideas involving this franchise but unfortunately they misfired on every cylinder dya see what i did there

visually this game is all over the place everything is so blurry on ultra settings and the textures vary from ultra sharp to shockingly low res

while i commend the usage of audio recordings of real drivers and sky sports f1 pundits there are far too few recorded lines
butim an old fart and those problems dont bother me that much  

the thing that tips the scales for me is the background simulation there is something really wrong with itwhat do i mean by that 
well ill give you a couple of examples

 sainz spins on his flying lap and he still manages to snatch a pole position with 1 second difference to the 2nd position

 if the simulation decides that you need to have a crash thats itno amount of savescumming will rectify that problem

it seems that frontier intends to refresh this franchise annually so lets hope that the next iteration will be better than f1 manager 23

#####

so many bugs

#####

i really enjoy playing this game and have played 35 seasons since release i feel that the improvements on the whole have been decent since the last release although there are definitely area that could be improved more 

the biggest issue which is completely unforgivable for a game that costs 45 is the crashes and bugs almost every single race i have a soft lock part way through the race meaning that i lose the progress that i have made for the last 12 hours its not even from doing one thing as i have had soft locks from the strategy screen weather screen pause menu pit menu and race engineer message pop ups its so frustrating and removes any immersion as i have to replay the same race over and over again with different results every time 

unfortunately with the state of the game at the moment i dont think i can continue to play as it is just a waste of my time

#####

game has nice updates coming in but sadly gamebraking bugs never get fixed getting stuck with pit box messages every 2 races and needing to restart the game and consequently restart the race cant recommend a game that has this bug since launch and seems not be something that the devs want to solve

#####

terrible terrible game i bought it in the hopes that this game is better then the last but i can not describe how anry i am for this lazy cash grab company everything is horrible and frankly i do not have the time nor the patiance to actually write a propper review but driver moral breaks the game you cant fight your way up in a small team as if you have an amazing qualifying and  end up in p6  you will get overtaken by a couple of big teams and your driver looses all moral and doesnt defend nor try to drive anymore and you get into the loop of dropping all the way down and once your at the bottom of the bord you wont get back up again making qualifying in p15 better then actually qualifying on pole position wtf where you thinking same with ingame events pit early to get the undercut then there is a race incident and everyone pits and your soft tires are still 90 percent good it took me 3 laps to go from p2 with daniel riccardo in a haas down to p19 even getting easily outpaced by my teamm8 kmag on worse tires hards with 70 percent  how bad can you execute a bad idea i tryed to get my money back but steam said no dont waste your money this game is easily the worst game i bought on steam ever

#####

do not buy this game

second year in a row the game does not start with the same 
unhandled exception exception_access_violation reading address 0x0000000000000000

the so called devs do not care about this problem at all it is a disgrace of a company

#####

its not bad for a management game still lacking many features outside of race weekend and there are some few game breaking bugs
worth a try if its on sale

#####

if you like a game that crashes all the time then you have come to the right place 3 times already this game has crashed and its like lasts years one i have an amd ryzen 7 5800x rx 7900 xt 32gb of ram and this so called game does not like it its becoming a joke now i should not have to change my setting to play this blood game im done with this now

#####

even  though the same game a much better version than the previous year races feel more enjoyable to play and the ai is improved 
there is also an added option of increasing difficulty of ai race strategy and ai car development which makes it much more challenging

overall good game better than the previous one hoping for further improvement in the future

#####

races are scripted to screw the players drivers over repeatedly to the point where you have to save scum every 3 laps and reload every time your driver locks up spins out or gets crashed into when youre not even pushing and as if that wasnt bad enough then your wind tunnel gets shut down due to being faulty four times at 20 days a time and cost of 800k a time by the 4th race stopping you from designing parts by its ridiculous 

f1m24 is coming out very soon dont buy any of them

#####

its just not enough to warrant the 50 dollar price tag quality of life changes team and driver updates tons of bugs from visual glitches and ui issues to audio issues and full freezes

#####

update due to very detailed dev response
to bruce garrido i watched the video not in full and at increased speed here is what i noted and for what you charge 60 euro this year

new things
 reworked everything  sure even widescreen ui mode is not working
 f2 and f3 simulation  i think its nice to see some sort of proof or evidence why certain drivers develop or not it was in previous game and had to be simulated somehow but nice you guys add an ui feature this time
 ui reworked  you guys display tire temperature now and bunch of new sim engine parameters
 pit stops mechanics  nicer graphic and official dhl sponsor there is a new member of staff that allows you to develop mechanics  train them more ui changes rather than new addition as i remember there was a way to increase effectiveness of your pit crew
 ui change of development of driversstaff where now you chose focus of their development rather than an rpg style point allocation
 you can switch teamsget fired shocker in management game revolutionary
 confidence mechanic another ui display of error chance

to sum up the developers decided to show more of their code in terms of ui changes the things i mentioned and devs say in the video to some extent had to be in previous game pit stop confidenceerrorsuccess rate tire performance etc had to somehow be simulated through some math equation and parameters they now make them visible to us and try to trick us that they are newly added to the simulation engine either way its a loss loss situation either previous sim engine were ridiculously simple or you just try to lie 

this is my opinion and i guess eafrontier do not agree with it 
first of all i do believe that its not a fault of hard working employees of these companies its a management issue and development plan you simply cant improve a game on a yearly basis i do believe that we will actually get a decent game at the end of the 2025 end of their initial release plan agreed with f1 license owner  liberty media this is the game they target to be great 

idea for better sim engine
make tire performance nonlinear its impossible to have soft tire degrade linearly ask any tire manufacturer for heavens sake you have another ea f1 game that actually works with f1 teams and they developed nonlinear tire performance use it 



old
this game is in worst shape then the previous one on the release the greed of these people 

dont buy it yet wait for the sale racing engine is the same they added some parameters for us to play which probably were already in the sim engine as a constant for every team nothing is new tbh except qatar and las vegas

i would love to talk to one of the producers or game developers and simply ask if they are happy with the product for which they charge 60 euro we are hungry for f1 game and unfortunately lm sold the rights to the worst company ever

#####

deep disappointment the game feels even more half cooked than last years very few noticeable new features the menu look even more clumsy to navigate with unnecessary animations that make it hard to move around the sections efficiently if you have last years game and enjoyed it good keep playing that one and save yourself some money

#####

this is literally my first game review in 14yrs on this platform and im writing this because honestly i had so much fun my first 5hours of gameplay that i really hope the devs see this and heavily look into the problem 

this game as a die hard f1 fan is incredible if youve ever screamed at the tv during the race yelling how ferraris strategist are all a bunch of clowns and how youd make this call or that call then this game is for you time to put your money where your mouth is 

being able to build a team up from the depths of the constructors championship to a a season dominating team is a prospect that would get any fan interested but there is a major problem keeping this game back and the reason im only at 5hrs play time this game crashes alot 

for my first couple hours i thought i was in the clear after seeing other reviews state the game crashes usually occur during the first couple races and seeing as i was a few races deep into the season with no issues i was thinking i was good but then miami happens im in the third practice session and suddenly the whole game freezes no cars are moving i can click on different screens but no actions take place and the game cannot proceed after closing and reopening the game i was kicked back over two weeks ingame season time to before baku where the game is constantly crashing in the middle of the race 

i cannot keep playing as the game literally wont let me please for the love of god fix this game

#####

game constantly crashes and saves are ruined as auto save isnt working properly either every sprint race the game crashes dont know how they can feel conformable releasing a game so unfinished playing the old one now with mods

#####

while this game has made small steps in the right direction it is still no where near complete nor optimised many parts of the game are great but some aspects of it make it so frustratingly unplayable the fact that you can get fired after just your first season for just missing out on the unrealistic targets set by the board is infuriating when playing with a back marker team its impossible to put your efforts during the first season into building for the future  next season as the board will set you an unrealistic constructor target and just fire you for not achieving it when surely the right thing to do as a back marker is have a difficult first season and research  design for next season to have a better chance at being competitive so annoyed that i put 20 hrs into season 1 building everything perfectly for season 2 the car the drivers the staff etc just to get fired for narrowly missing out on the ridiculous constructor target set

#####

game crashes every time i try to load


#####

my entire play time is just me stuck on the licensing page waiting for it to work

#####

lewis hamilton must retire now if this is realistic to his performances irl

#####

i want to love this game but i feel like botrh f1 23 and motorsport manager still have more mechanics  frontier is pricing f1m23 as a aaa game but it is light on features  i know many have posted their own thoughts on what is still missing but i really want to see more out of both the car development think of all the individual options in the mainstream f1 games and facility development  i would love to see a mode where i can build remodel renovate upgrade move demolish landscape all my facilities

dont get me wrong i will still play for a few seasons but i am mostly flagging this as a no so frontier steps up their game for f1m24

#####

4 seasons only  even gunther got more than that  for this reason wont be buying anymore of this title

#####

the game got updated and a lot better and deserves a potisitive review now






as of right now patch 15 i do not recommend to buy this

there are too many bugs

when they are fixed it is going to be a great game that is very very similar to f1 manager 22
the game is a bit more difficult weird and has this cool new fastest pitstop mechanic that not realistic at all you can literally gym train nearly full time and get the gap to 19 sec and all your pitstops are 19 if no mistakes happen this is because car building is kinda useless

the sprint races are unfortunately like last year you qualify for the race in the sprint

other stuff i noticed were
weather conditions change too fast in qualifying wet to full dry in 1 min
other team ai cars are broken at the start of the race i play 32x speed williams
when someone crashes its a 5050 chance the victim gets the penalty
research is not customizable this looks to be but the values are eventually equal on all stats when looking at the board
money calculations for new seasons starts are only looking at merchandising

#####

h1 coming from a f1 manager 2022 player h1

there are some stuff that im disappointed towards to  some stuff that i liked i was disappointed from the practice in f1 2022 practice didnt had much of a game changer role just a small minigame which is repeated the same thing over  over which is as well the same in f1 2023 like you can absolutely just skip practice sessions  it wont matter because they dont offer you that much of a reward for completing them other than boosting the drivers confidence even if you had high driver confidence it doesnt matter if youre not in a frontrunning team it should have been more awarding for the player to play it even the concept of the driver confidence is kinda useless when i skip the practice i always get about 70 confidence its usually high enough anyways practice is a big part of f1 it needs more features 

summary

 i was very disappointed with practice sessions as it was literally the same thing from the previous game no any noticeable change was made practice should have been taken in consider way more as practice is a big part of the f1 after all 

 
 h1 all of this was just only about the practiceh1

b team radio b

now i have notes to say about other stuff team radio for an example i am still massively disappointed about it last year game had the same issue with team radio for me i love every it  i love every bit of it whenever i listen to my drivers voices  team radio it makes my experience way more engaging and this is the thing sometimes the drivers wouldnt speak  only text would show up why that why couldnt every voice line be there i hated it last year  unfortunately its the same with this year

h1 drivers models downgrade h1

i havent seen too many people talk about that but really the drivers models need more improvements it even feels like a downgrade when i compared it to f1 2022 i compared george russells character model between the 2 games f1 2022 felt way better than f1 2023 when it came to this comparison same goes to most drivers their character models felt better when comparing between 2 games

h1 just like most yearly games h1

most of the games that release every year like fifa usually the upgrades are not that different to even call it a new game this game falls into that category perhaps i expected more from this game as it is the 2nd instalment in series after all all the new upgrades that were made here could have easily been made onto the previous game tbh why charging me the whole price of a brand new game when it feels just like an update thats why i hate similar games to that 

h1 the game is far by miles from being a manager game in the first placeh1

not many stuff are really in depth  details my review only on the practice system alone really shows how that game is not in depth its kinda repetitive as well like imagine if the game was in depth  was like what i wanted not only with practice but with quali  with racing as well 

h1 no multiplayer h1

i believe it can be very fun if it was a multiplayer game i had some thrilling battles with the ai  it was wonderful if it were a multiplayer the thrilling battles would even be better


h1 whats positive though h1 
    it is more realistic from some aspects now the pit stops are more likely to have issues that lead into very slow pit stops which is of course more realistic i liked managing the pit stop schedule pretty creative however i believe we needed to see more about it like i mentioned previously 

    more features added to the gameplay like the fact you can ask the drivers to be more aggressive with the overtakes or not at all but well not that different than last year tbh

    managing is more challenging than last year i tried managing with mercedes  now they want to kick me lol which didnt happen at all last year

    replay the recent irl races which feels cool but honestly but im not sure if it will do the job as for long term well at least i do like the fact that there is sort of a coloration between irl  the game in that case

    exclusive scenarios but you pay 12 for 12 new scenarios which i find too much tbh

to make this review fair i need to mention positive stuff as well which i did i did enjoyed some stuff however the new features are not that much compared to the fact it is a new game cons are more than pros basically _ツ_


h1 conclusion h1

i only have 85 hours playtime not the highest playtime to be that judgemental however last year on my f1 manager 22 review i was being more easy as it was the first game after all i liked the potential it had so i was being easy in hope that the next time ill see a new game that matches my expectations and this didnt certainly i expected way more for the fact that the price tag is 4499 i expected to see a massive difference which there is but tbh not that difference than last year doesnt worth the price if you are entirely new to the series okay it might worth it but coming from someone who tried last years game nahh if the price is worth a new completely different game then show me a new completely different game the  gameplay is literally the same but with smarter ai  enhanced crash scenarios pretty much i liked the new features but still not enough for the price the game is pretty repetitive as well  the review would be 5 times longer if i went into everything in depth  it wouldnt be positive either i went only through practice in details as much as i could the review is already pretty big which is why im gonna stop here 

it does really lack quite lots of stuff for the game to be a manager game its not even a bug free game honest review

#####

at imola why is my driver slamming on his brakes in the middle of the main straight during quali and the race for a car that is on the other side of a concrete wall in the pit lane  why do the drivers drive as if they have no clue what a racing line is as well as having some sort of seizure at the wheel resulting in jerky motions every half a secondthat blatantly slow the car down and look ridiculous why do drivers not use the slipstream of another car to maximum effect they rather pull into free air from 20 metres away and pray they have enough power to get by these are the best drivers in the world and you make them look like learner drivers on their first lesson why are their no penalties for blocking in qualifying which happens every session yet every single contact in the races results in a penalty why are the traction zones so far after each turn why is there a radio message every single time your car is close behind another for failed overtake even when there was never any attempt resulting in confidence drop why are ai cars driving like they have no fuel excess after every restart

did you ever watch motorsport

honestly nothing in this game is in balance just look at the ridiculous lines the drivers take and the inconsistency of lap times in quali these are f1 drivers the differences should be fractions this game is not a management game it is an rng game just look how the drivers never move out of their lanes they are all on a track like trains and then will use lanes at random times to try an overtake even then they are glitching into other cars every time and getting no damage they couldnt even implement that properly at the second time of asking then the drivers ram their inside front through every wall they can find with no damage either that is not an elite level motorsport management game then we look at the way the ai sends out the cars in quali in some random order that means the track is never clear for a free run straight rng all the issues present in this game were present in the first one it is the laziest attempt at a yearly sports game i have ever seen and ive played them all the tyre temperatures literally dont do anything you can just push with overheating tyres the whole race the morale system is also broken as it directly conflict with the lane system so the two main selling points for the new game are utterly useless the way incidents are portrayed in the highlights but how they actually effect the race is not the same straight rng the developers of this game have literally never watched a motor race in their lives i am sure of it anyone with a passion for racing could not release this mess that is how gaming is these days im afraid there is no real regulation going on massive companies are selling broken and unfinished products to the masses on the regular and nothing is being done about it so the investors will just keep forcing garbage down our throats and getting paid for it

#####

please work on your game crashes i only played 36 hours and my game already crashed over 10 times

#####

a good upgrade from 22 would wait for a sale though as 50 bucks for any game is too much 

#####

so many more bugs than last year will update the review once im a good way through the season but im not impressed so far by the lack of polish especially compared to last year which wasnt exactly perfect

#####

finally i can put a stop to verstappens reign of terror

edit first race of the season sainz tried overtaking alonzo and he went from 4th place to 20th place on the 2nd lap its so over ferrari bros

#####

love the game but has many bugs and crashes when things popup during the race

#####

this game is trash the developers are making this on the fly and they have no idea what they are programming in the game or how it reacts

#####

 i bought the game with discount even tho i had already read some negative comments i decided to give it a shot 
 an old fan of motorsport manager and entusiast of f1 having bought the f1 manager 22 as well i have to say this game is not worth it so many bugs jams the game is boring at times another copy paste of f1 22 that was on its own a copy paste of motorsport manager
 the best thing on this game is that it gave me some motivation to become a game writer because they are probably making this game being just game developers but having no idea or passion for motorsports what so ever sadly the ideas that came into my mind were mostly the same ones that i have expected for motorsport manager a game with more or less 10 years old
 but the music is great its the f1 songs after all

#####

a good continuation from the 2022 edition added features and improved upon existing features from the previous game the game feels more realistic and challenging this year in terms of the car development and maintenance from crashes and part deterioration over time the ai strategy and development is much improved upon and keeps the career more challenging throughout each playthrough

#####

dont buy this broken game 
car dont move out the way on an out lap and your driver is on a hot lap 
screen freezes when the notification to pit come up ever other race 
your drivers are so dumb while trying to overtake with drs but stay behind the car in front
drivers albon and zhou in my case crash 5 races in a row while driving at normal pace
your drivers lose 2 secs in 3 corners even when the specs on your car say youre 1st or 2nd for each part on your car 
tyre degradation isnt a thing for the ia for some reason

dont waste your money

#####

still a ton of issues after last year trying to manufacturer parts and they say complete but cant put them on my car

#####

not very impressed with this game still a lot of glitches for a second addition of the game and its far to basic the fact you can win the first season using haas in hard mode says its not realistic at all the ai is very basic if you go off the track slightly you cant rejoin the track until every car passes you 

stick with motorsports manager

#####

big improvements on the first game the carrer mode feels more challenging both in and out of track the ai seems to be doing its job more efficiently competing on car improvements and responding to events happening on races

#####

massive improvement from last years game this year the degradation is actually like real life for a lot of tracks barcelona marina bay zandvoort and it requires brain power you cant just simulate everything do quali and get a 12 by 50 seconds

#####

quite honestly the same game as last year for which you pay 30 or normally 50 with a few new features such as the possibility of pit stop errors and with that an ingame mechanic in which you train your pit crew to become more efficient however similarly to the rest of the games cycle this can be overlooked and your crew can be trained on certain areas and you will not be punished in addition to this the addition of driver confidence which has come with some struggles in which some drivers seem to forget how to drive after they have crashed but overall not a bad idea furthermore there are still numerous areas which have been overlooked despite suggestions in their server and one of the most annoying ones would be that somehow the most experienced drivers can forget everything about a track that theyve driven on for years over the timespan of a year and when you come back to that track the following season their acclimatisation is reset to 0 which makes absolutely no sense for drivers such as fernando alonso 2021 seasons and lewis hamilton 15 seasons another absurd thing about the game that i have heard others complain about the game and i have also experienced myself is that some teams eg red bull have voted in favour of regulation changes that would sabotage their own car such as 30 on downforce which would make complete sense another thing that i would also like to address in this review is the stupid crashes and their animations in the game and alongside this the stupid penalty system in which the driver who is not at fault for the incident is penalised unjustly and i have experienced this far too many times with bottas in my alfa romeo save in which he is being crashed into with what seems like every week and this ultimately results in a lower grid position for a car that is already horrendous in season one furthermore i have also heard and seen reports in others players saves in which fernando alonso consistently crashes in the same spot in the castle section at baku for 2 consecutive years in addition to this it would be a good feature to actually bother to add proper reserve drivers to half the teams and allow for these drivers to continue running in f2 without having to pull them out finally regarding drivers there are no special traits for them such as for hamilton having a trait for improved performances in wet conditions and for perez to have a king of the street trait or king of countries with a lack of human rights which could be easily implemented for a video game manufacturer with a relatively high budget if i knew that this game would have been practically a carbon copy of f1m22 then i wouldnt have even paid the 30 that i did as it was a complete waste i hope that this review will result in something constructive but i highly doubt that it will

#####

okay here we go f1 manager 2023 or should i say f1 manager 20225 no really its basicly the same thing is it bad no far from it its a decent manager title it surely lacks the depth of a motorsport manager 2 but it has some really nice graphics and its not as buggy as some reviews make it seem to be 

i am having fun dont get me wrong but i am missing stuff theres just not enough management going on for that pricetag i would expect to have at least some features that would make my time in the game worthwhile sadly most of anything in it does not impact anything whatsoever between races i hire and fire people design car parts build car parts upgrade facilities and try not to do anything stupid and when it comes to trackdayi play a minigame with sliders and give some orders from time to time that dont seem to affect the outcome very muchif at all trust me i tried and the results were pretty much the same no matter if i did give orders or not now i realize im not having as much fun as i thought i had huh

all in all it is a decent game but theres stuff missing interaction and response to things feels worse than in f1 manager 22 and lets be honest herethe new features frontier put in here are not worth 5060 bucks not even close i understand that the license is expensive but as a developer if you want to get your expenses back you maybe should try to make a product that actually fullfills the expectations of your customers on a technical level frontier nearly made no mistakesgameplay wiseid probably stick to motorsport manager 2 or some other mobile game with more depth and impact sorry frontier you managed to make a couple of really impressive games thisthis however maybe you should stick with spaceships zoos and parks

#####

if i could leave neutral opinion i would but i do not recommand this game with the price it currently has
 1 the game has many bugs like wrong emails sliders not working correctly ai using only one compound through the whole race etc
2 the game still feels too repetative after some amount of seasons because there are too few regulation changes there need to be more like return of refueling calendar changes 11th team and beyond coming to the grid etc
 3 i have no freaking idea why managing your own team and progressing through f3 f2 and f1 is not a main feature of this game
4 development system actually got worse in my opinion it is way too slow meaning many drivers wont wont even be useful to you as a team principal

#####

you have to focus or you just lose

#####

game crashes and i cant even play it

#####

i really love this game its very very good and thanks for giving us good game like this but it would be even better if we can play multiplayer and people please take considiration that this game is second of this title please have patience they will improve as this series goes on happy racing to everyone

#####

not an actual impovement from last years game if you love f1 and dont have f1 manager 22 get it on sale

#####

mt bom

#####

its good but i am still bad and apparently can not make any team good or get points more than once with an alfa romeo

#####

important things are still missing the track improvement in qualifying is not real it is always the same in all races and only at the end of each session the track improves slightly when there are penalties it is not possible to know how many positions each driver is penalized until the race begins the sprint are not updated the qualy shootout is missing when are you going to remove de vries and replace him with ricciardo in the intro and in the game its a disaster of a game it is incredible that you put it up for sale with so many flaws and shortcomings since the same thing happens next year i wont buy it again it is a shame

#####

please add engine development

#####

firstly to be clear if youre a person who already know theyre gonna enjoy this game go ahead and buy it you likely will enjoy a decent portion of your time with this game this games presentation is topnotch and the radio calls for engineers and drivers as well as commentators provides a fantastic atmosphere 

but the more time you spend with it the more you see some of the shallow aspects of the simulation taking away from your enjoyment tire management makes little to no difference overtaking is often way too difficult obviously the developers took the feedback from last years game to heart but took it both too literally and too far this years game has more perceived depth and is more difficult but the difficulty doesnt particularly feel fair especially for a backmarker team for example pulling off a godly qualifying after nailing your setup and practice just leads to you immediately falling to the back of the pack and crashing as your driver loses confidence every time theyre overtaken and telling them to defend like a lion just makes it way too likely youll crash even around monaco it feels better to be at the back trying to overtake then at the front defending and overtaking is unreasonably difficult this game imo likely due to the change to how ers works 

i found research did surprisingly little even putting most of a years wind tunnel time and cfd hours into next years car did next to nothing for my relative performance on top of that for most of my 40 hours playing this game development was broken with the sliders changing absolutely nothing on next years car 

overall my message to frontier is that the game has a great deal of potential but the key structural design problems that plagued last years game continue here i have no idea what the fix is but i can say i think itll need to be a creative change not just tweaking values and adding another mechanic here or there ill probably be skipping next years game and coming back in 23 years to see what theyve achieved

#####

i much prefer the game this year the way the drivers develop is what i expected 

hopefully they continue to build in this direction and add more magenarial stuffs

#####

where is the w14b and the sf23b 

#####

i can finally say that you can buy the game not all bugs are fixed but most of them qualifying got better from the first view i am satisfied finally

old
h1i can now gladly tell you that there was no patch since 17 daysh1
bpatch 105 game crashes now sometimes in races after the updateb
cant recommend the game for the full price its basically the old game with one or two bigger patches qualifying is still a mess drivers are making space for you but they dont slow down before corners to let you through overall qualifying is very important but with the new stylecars will go out of the box at any time its very difficult to get a no traffic lap in also after 4 days of early access there was only one single update and it was one single point fixed as seen below
h1f1 manager 2023  update 14h1
a small patch for f1 manager 23 is rolling out for pc

fixed crash that could occur if red flag triggered near end of race

ba few more hours went by and more issues have been identifiedb

1ai starts qualifying laps too late when the finish line is at thge end if a long straight this applies to all drivers so its not a severe bug but it still needs to be addressed
2your drivers are sometimes taking the defensive line in qualifying when there are other cars on the straight
3occasionally when someone exits the pit and enters the track your drivers slow down on the straight to let them in
4another issue seems to be a development bug that results in lower stats for parts than stated

#####

honestly such a step up on last years game the ai is difficult and you have to really plan your upgrades and plan during race weekends

great game for f1 fans depth still slightly lacking in some areas socials and interviews etc but its finally what 2022 should of been

#####

i didnt play f1 manager 22

game is too pricey id give it max 40bucks

big cons 
 ai cars are hardly blocking in quali they dont know how to get out of the way for other cars during their fast laps
 some cars during overtakes can just drive through other cars
 crashes are not much improved stil not realistic i guess they added crashes that were not in 2022 version
 some cars might drive through wallbarriers while drifting after crash
 some of the radios are often repeatable and not translated well to other languages sometimes you can read the talk between driver and engineer but there is no sound for that
 will edit soon

#####

researching to the next years car doesnt even do shit

#####

1010

#####

i really want to love this game and ive tried its an improvement over last years iteration but there is still far too much wrong

watch any number of videos where people explain game mechanics because the game doesnt do it and youll constantly hear about the options and sliders in the game that literally make no difference a prime example is researching parts for the next season it doesnt matter if you want to optimise for cooling the game will default it to balanced this makes a lot of things in the game absolutely pointless

i will come back to this game after a few months once its been patched because i believe itll be worth it then right now however it simply is not worth it

#####

drivers are far better at getting out of your way for quali or blueflags safty car unlaps lapped cars correctly tyres have a obvious delta in performance both between compounds and age teams use different strats in the races and dont do really stupid things under safty car 

its a solid game tbh its not the disaster its made out to be quite a big improvement over 2022

#####

 cant build a part because of factory fire
 cant start race because of no parts


#####

they didnt change anything and it also aint enjoyable might aswell play motorsport manager

#####

nah
its better but we still aint there

#####

this is the most unbalanced and the least long term focused manager game i have ever played

pros eye candy good graphics 

cons literally everything that isnt cool graphics is severely lacking when you consider it is a management game people who are behind the game design are frankly clueless and the sparce updates have only lowered players confidence in frontier when it comes to understanding game balance 

only worth a buy if its half price

#####

after reading previous negative reviews on this game i swerved purchasing it until it was on sale im glad that i didnt pay full price the game has potential  theres no doubt but without the option to create your own team for me the game is not attractive i dont want to play as an existing team i dont support any of the existing teams also f2  f3 should feature a more prominent role in the game id like to be able to start a driver development programme or manage some young drivers the graphics are good and because its officially licenced you get all of the proper liveries sponsors and tracks but i just feel as if the game has very limited lifespan

#####

after one week theres nothing else to do with this game game is too easy cant create my own team or change teams the game looks amazing but is too shallow not much to do after 4 seasons and winning everything playing with williams

#####

this game is crashing so much on optimal pit stop screen so annoying then you have a good race and you have to restart the game if developers cant resolve this issue just write to me it 2 hours of work

#####

nice improvement to last season the races are more engaging the stuff you need to do behind the scenes is more the graphics are crisper it sounds better ai is much improved rain is harder to predict tire model makes for all sorts of strategies the wrecks are worth watching the replays for but could still look better

they even got the weird qualifying rules for some of the races where they must use hards in q1 and meds in q2 sprint format is last years but thats okay the rules were changed late

there some things that need tweaking the cars are still kind of jittery out there and do a few weird things but less than last year certainly not perfect but i look forward to their continued improvements in the years to come and this year too

theres some menu bugs and such too

theres also many additions they could still add to the game that havent made it yet one day i hope to see the changes to a design when you upgrade perhaps you can pick from a few designs for a part

more tv style stuff maybe formation lap or partial one to build up some suspense more spray from cars in wet weather calendar changes in subsequent seasons maybe being able to add old or new tracks to a schedule and stuff to keep it fresh over a long career

being able to make your own team didnt make it im not too worried about it but lots would like that but its still fun as is

feel free to ask any questions in the comments ill be glad to answer

#####

so i originally downvoted this game because it crashed twice in the first hour of playing and i assumed it would continue to do so

ive now played for approx 20 hours and it hasnt crashed since so i am changing my review to an upvote

the game is different enough to f1 manager 22 to warrant buying as it feels like a different game

there are a few qol annoyances  that the previous game didnt have but the game as a whole seems like an improvement over the last one

#####

in its current form this game is a mess it has all the same issues as last year including a lack of widescreen ui support even though the option is there and they think they can make up with it by introducing a pretty helmetcam

not to mention the fact that i am pretty sure what inputs you make dont matter or they made the game easier when your input is controller i did a control test of bahrain using a ps5 controller on steam link to my tv and with the exact same inputs i run p9 and p14 comfortably with mclaren same save on pc and i am half a second a lap slower with the same inputs and everyone is breezing past me and by lap 10 i am running last two spots with both cars

there is literally no agency in this game its a race simulator in the most literal sense pretty helmet cam go brrrrrrrr

dont make the mistake i did in thinking the second iteration would have moved it forward

#####

who thought it was a good idea to release this
so many bugs 
i still play

#####

runs surprisingly well on the steam deck as long as you play on medium settings with a 30fps lock few drops here and there when moving about in the menus and sometimes the textures take a second to load in but its more than playable could do with a performance update to make it run even better

#####

why is steiner looking at me like that

#####

gotta give it a negative review because it really is just last years game with a new roster even fifa changes more from year to year the bugs menus even the music is exactly the same they did not feel the need to improve the game at all i did enjoy last years title but i would strongly recommend against getting this one just find a third party mod to change last years roster and boom free sequel

#####

game half finshedwould of been better off releasing this when the big update is done
waste of money as it stand
can see alot of people turning there back on the 24 version next year

#####

its the same damn game ai is dog still this could have easily been an update to the old game

#####

same as last year at first it seems interesting but there is nothing about real f1 in it the drivers are just numbers for example stroll beats alonso almost every time in every session for me everithing is steril sometimes 2 carrs collide and then they cause somethig or not nothing has a meaming in it the mini games are boring and repetitive there is nothing which would keep me playing it

#####

ive played 8 hours so far and my experience has been plagued with problems including multiple complete crashes of the game it seems the developers didnt increase the bar all that much from last year and a lot of the game is copy and pasted from f1m22 with updated car liveries same radio messages yes there are added ones but the same ones are still in from last year same rough on track animations essentially the same game sprint races arent the same format used in this years real season either and still the same as last year if youre happy to pay 80aud for essentially the same game with a couple extra features which could have easily been general quality of life improvements for f1m22 then be my guest but right now im not sure how anyone can recommend this game in its current state and what is a visible lack of effort for an official f1 game

#####

poor game not an improvement on last years game its obvious nobody developing the game likes or watches f1 i know the changed the sprint format was changed last minute but an official game should be able to change and get details like that right also things they got right last year are now wrong the amount wind tunnel time should change depending where you are in the championship and it doesnt this year why is there no create your own team mode last years game you could see potential and this year hasnt lived up to it

#####

just fun 


#####

peak

#####

this game is amazing if you enjoyed the first one you will really enjoy this  the level of immersion is second to none

#####

very nice game the cars go vrooooooom vroooooom

#####

huge huge huge step up from f1 manager 2022 game requires actual brain power to get things done you cant mindlessly go through rd anymore it takes some thinking the ai are actually good with strategies development and in race trim overall the game made amazing strides over 2022 worth the 55 bucks you pay for it

#####

seems pretty unfinished a few glitches have frozen the game and many have ruined it ive seen pit stop glitches delay the pit and crashed cars teleport back on track

#####

cant play the game anymore due to game breaking bugs that have been brought up since release freezes my pc and cant even use task manager to close hot garbage

#####

original review game crashes almost as much as lance stroll  do not recommend

revised review this game is actually decent frontier are showing a real dedication to fixing any issues that crop up but generally its a huge improvement on 2022 and most ctd issues have already been resolved i would now recommend this to any motorsport or management fans  its in a very good condition right now and even if frontier left it in its current state its more than worth the money theyre promising to keep at it though which can only be a good thing

#####

loved manager 22 have 68 hours on the game

cant reccommend this because

graphics worse than 22
more buggy than 22
crashes so often  decision to refund with in 45min
scenarios are bugged 

although it is more realistic  it feels somehow more restrictive and almost impossible to actually improve your team

wait for this game to be fixed  or steam sale

play f1 manager 22 instead

#####

amazing game allows a challeng but also funnnnn

#####

i like it feels a lot better and more satisfying than 22  no more rampant car crashes and tires work properly

#####

very good much better than last year

#####

a very nice upgrade when compared to f1 manager 2022 races are far more interesting and difficulty has been increased both on and off the track

hopefully theyll continue to build on this in the next few months and fix some of the more annoying issues and bugs but overall im happy with my purchase and will get my moneys worth without a doubt

can definitely recommend getting this on sale if youre strapped for cash otherwise if money is not a problem and you love f1 just get it

#####

the game is definitely fun if you like manager games as far as i know its very similar to the previous game and couldve been a patch for it i enjoy it i didnt play the previous f1 manager games but i find it fun and thrilling each race weekend and deciding on what to spend my budget on it has a few issues twice ive had the game crash near the end of a race but otherwise it seems great some weird events happen sometimes with different drivers spinning out saying they had understeer when they had oversteer and causing a red flag without being in the way of the track or other racers seems it needs a little polish hopefully the devs wont abandon it like the last one and this can be a good game

#####

it is better version of last years game many things improved and the game looks promising there are still visual and some minor gameplay bugs but its manageable and i hope it gets fixed soon only problem i have with the game is the new tire temps they are maybe bit too harsh and it limits how much you can push normally i wouldnt post a review so early but i dont think this game deserves mixed rating

#####

godawful manager game the ai is extremly overtuned and unfair there is no possible way to even get points with weaker teams giving commands to your drivers mid race is pointless as the ai will always have the best strategy possible

this manager game feels like a joke game to play i deeply regret buying this

#####

he does not fok smash my door

1010 would smash door again

good game play with a steep learning curve
great graphics with impressive sound design


#####

if you played the previous game you will love this one as well it looks like the same game but with few improvements i am on the second season with mclaren and i am really happy that there are no stupid driver mistakes anymore recommended just buy it on discount

#####

best management game after football manager

#####

the game is buggy and not much different than f1 manager 22 i wish the devs knew what they were doing

#####

when the car is on the runningthen i will crash every timehow to fix it

#####

update
i still cant recommend this game
there is no genuine difference between this game and last game so save it for the next game i will admit tho unlike other brands these guys the devs the design team are actively working to improve the game as it goes so this only leads to a better game next yearhopefully
i feel the hardest time of this game is the first year possbily 2nd too depending on which team you start with
ai are still unbalanced and inconsistent to reality
game crashes alot still altough there is less spins crashes and cautions during a race now and its a little more realistic on this now too soo kudos
i wish this game could focus more on the celebratations allow drivers to have their own helmet still when they move teams bring records into the game etc it would be alot better game would feel more incentive

i cant recommend this game  here is why 

 game crashes too much if it doesnt crash it freezes when you run out of fuel or towards the end of a session at one point i was getting a tip and it froze huh
ai is badly unbalanced
the driver behind you can follow you the whole race being 02 behind you but get no punishment the moment you run out of ers the ai just bltiz you and while you recover you lose spots and never regain
car balance is bad redbull dominant all yet but ive had best strat and still lost to a alpine and aston martin at bahrain
oscar p and tsunoda are torpedos  but you will get penalised for being hit still
 penalites are too common 
 drivers ratings are very biased towards british drivers how is oscar a 73 how is alonso also 2nd best
 too many accidents per race spins and lock ups happen way to much and you loose way too much time for these its ultra unrealistic
 inconsistent drivertrack and car balances during the race weekends one race they get 15th the next they get 2nd same type of track how
 f2 and f3 drivers are still not acknowledged no photos or scans of face ridiculous

ok sosure the updates upgrades and all that are cool but the game is seriously struggling to keep the glitches out not only that it doesnt matter what car you start with if your not paying attention 100 of the time you will crash cause an accident lose several spots or in most practices or qualy run out of fuel
the ai is so unbalanced one race in australia i have alonso kicking my arse in a redbull even putting 10 secs on verstappen after just getting a full blown out upgrade on the underbody  known to be the op body upgrade to do in this game but when i use aston martin in australia im like 10th and struggling 
the ai is not on easy normal or hard mode its whatever the fuck we want it to be insane at its actually crazy mode a casual or first timer would not enjoy this game the devs need to seriously balance the drivers the cars are no longer going to be the reason why you are up the front oh and another thing how the fuck is oscar 73 the fuck the kid showed potential and is doing insanely well even before the current run of form he needs to be 83 not 73 ridiculous and ricco is 83 the fuck his like 8586 lance stroll is also too high sainz and leclerc are not their value and to have alonso as 2nd overall seriously thats frigin laughable devs need to overhaul this game real bad
do not buy yet once the game balance gets done then it will be a better and more fun game to play
fingers crossed the devs put in easy medium and hard mode to select before starting a career makes no sense not too

#####

f1 manager 23 is not without its issues but is overall an enjoyable game if you are already a fan of the sport or sports management games in general 

the game provides a decent level of challenge depending on the team you pick and has a reasonably deep simulation of the sport both on and off the track certain aspects could do with more depth race strategy in particular feels a little one dimensional and seems to always have 1 correct answer of more stops with higher push levels 

whether the game is enough of an upgrade from last year however is debatable with one of the major touted changes being the situations that are very much one and done and even in that one go arent particularly compelling if you own f1 manager 22 id say wait for a discount

#####

same bugs as in f1 2022 new softer tyres are slower than hards my pit stop length 30 seconds and opponent is 20 seconds loljust great steal of money again

#####

definitely improved from last years game but pretty sure this is rigged

#####

edit now the game crashes when using dx12 for no reason its the only game it does it on 

people complain for the sake of it f1m23 is 100 better than f1m22 crashes now actually look like crashes and cars will not just stop when hit like they used to cars feel more life like overall as well i do hope they keep updating the game for the entire year this time and not just a few patches then leave it

#####

would like to recommend it but cant 
it has a lovely visual design and you can see that there went some thought into the gameplay 

sadly after round about two weeks after release it still feels ridden with bugs
 game crashed on more than two handful of occasions in races feels extra bitter 
 random empty overlays appear in race that block nearly the entire screen so you cant close them and cant interact with the game anymore
 balance and expectations of teams are not where they should be  to just name a few

plus my very personal two cents 
i am not interested at all in the race replay nor scenario modes zero value for me  i much rather have the option to switch teams which is atleast around the block or ffs create my own team there are talks about new teams joining f1 so it is authentic to add this as a feature 
or add a mode where you can start in i dont know 2000 and go from there with some historic data

in addition the price is way too high for what is offered full price game that is merely an addon of the last years edition with new bugs to fix and if we are lucky more than 3 months worth of further development incoming until every resource goes into the next years game

should be 30 bucks max and have an early access tag but that would be unfair for games that actually get further proper development more than handful of months for that state

#####

although a management game i like to be visually pleased but the in race graphics are really poor i thought last years was bad until the engineini fix seems to be nothing this year to provide an overall fix

#####

so this one is a hard one for me i would love to recommend it and id recommend the previous game because i loved it but this one i just cant stay in the game for more than 1 or 2 races it gets annoying fast and progress is just sluggish car parts are apparently made out of paper because im at the 10th race of the season and i already have to take a 10 place grid penalty for getting a new ers system also after every race i have 1 or 2 car parts failing inspection meaning i have to replace them but i have neither enough money nor enough time to replace all those car parts while developing new ones meaning i cannot really develop my car i have resorted to only doing research as i wont be able to build the car parts i develop for the current car anyways and i develop every car part on the default longlivety meaning i dont even sacrifice stability for performance and yet they still suck when it comes to holding together and ill have to buy new engine parts in a few races too which i dont really have the money for and ill get even more grid penalties yay

#####

little bit better than the first game however too many gameplay issues as frequent pit stop issues ai always faster at start of the race lapped cars problems same as 2022 version weird loss of driver confidence which is game breaking to be honest 2022 version was more enjoyable than 2023

#####

very basic menus graphics are pretty good but overall pretty boring better off just playing the regular f1 games

#####

goated

#####

highly recommend this game yes it still has flaws but its better than ever its harder then last years game  more drivers and more tracks even though all the extra sprint races ruins the finances a bit it is a challenge a grind as it should be

#####

too many crashes everything is too expensive you dont get enough moey at the start with any team that isnt red bull merc or ferrari period to do fck all  and the crashes each cost you at least about 5 million to rebuild the car and guarenteed you will not make it through a full season without one of your drivers crashing out at least ten times compeltely unplayable garbe i will not be fucking playing at all until this is fixed and in fact i want my money back

#####

i really really wanted this to be a great game it is not maybe years down the road it can be a decent 20 game for this price tag the lack of depth the amount of bugs and crashes the first months not worth the money

#####

cant swap drivers between car 1  2 without breaking the contract

#####



#####

 mate  i have no brakes  no tyres  we are out of the points    i mean we try to do whatever but  i dont care too much  

#####

if you enjoyed f1 manager 2022 then you will most certainly enjoy this years newest iteration of it with more in depth car development driver confidence changing over a weekend which can either adversely affect them or positively affect them additionally the game is also a lot harder than last year so you cant just take a team towards the back of the grid in the first year and suddenly be championship contenders the next season 

overall i would recommend f1 manager 2023

#####

its okay

#####

excellent simulation for formula 1 fans the race replays and race moments are an excellent addition and challenge

#####

after a little over one season played here are some of the issues i had
 practice penalty for 0 seconds should tell grid penalty for the race and how many places
 some wheel to wheel racing goes on for way too long and in parts of the track where it ist almost impossible irl ie castle section in baku
 cars losing pace for no appearent reason overtook someone on a straight with drs just to let them back through and losing almost 2 seconds
 emails in the inbox are sorted weird sometimes
 cant check weather report only in strategy selection before a race no info before practice and quali
 the game always asks if you are sure you want to manage a session just let me tik a box dont ask me again
 cars glitching through other cars to overtake
 ui glitches breaking the game completely cant click on anything esc doesnt work have to altf4
 drs enabled text in full wet prob only visual bug still annoying
 too many collisions in practice cars getting in the way in quali
 graphical issues like sponsores in the pitlane being mirrored
 sprint preperation shows gridplace for sundays race
 sprint format is the old one

#####

very little change from the last game bug the break the game if you want this just go and buy f1 manager 22

#####

significant improvement on the first game yes its harder but that is because it is more realistic and you have to spend more time familiarising yourself with how to get the best from the new features makes getting those first points with williams even more satisfying

#####

updated review since my original review many months ago further down the developer has introduced numerous updates fixing the game breaking bugs as well as many other issues along with adding new features including team changes finally this adds some replayability to the career mode thank you for listening to the community and delivering on this popular request i can now recommend this game to any f1motorsport manager game fans

this game has improved on last years game in that the features that were rather shallow in f1 manager 22 have been more fleshed out in this years it is also more of a challenge as you cant just put all the part development sliders to the right and churn out underfloors to quickly max out your cars potential and take the bottom team to the top within just a couple seasons you have to actually think about your part designs and focus on particular aspect whilst aiming to have it ready for a certain race to get the most out of it however this game currently has 1 huge problem being the penalty system im not sure how this wasnt found and fixed during qa but if 2 drivers collide the driver who caused the collision doesnt get the penalty instead the other driver does which really ruins the game and forces a reload of the race start save if its your drivers because its really not fair i also noticed the drivers and staff contract renewals are now ridiculous where they expect a massive pay rise  bonuses compared to their current contract regardless of how well they have performed which really makes it more difficult then it needs to be for managing your teams finances overall a few small features have been added that do improve the game and a few problems from last years game have also been improved onfixed but it doesnt feel like a new game instead it feels like more of a big patch for last years game i also dont know who asked for the scenario races i have no interest in playing one off races based on the real world season the community have asked for many other things from last years game that would have greatly improved this years one of the big ones being the ability to switch teams within the same save if you are performing well to help prolong the replayability such as getting 1 team to the top then jumping to the current bottom team and try to do it again as well as being able to see how the other teams evolve if you havent played f1 manager 22 then this one is worth the full price as you get to experience last years game  a few new small features and fixes from it otherwise if you did play last years game i dont see the value for money in this years based on what little has been addedchanged when it goes on sale though id recommend it after they fix the penalty bug as that is game breaking besides that i am having fun with the game but its the same fun i had with last years as too little has been addedchanged to justify this at full price as a whole new game which is a real shame

#####

games rigged

#####

the constant crashing cars not the game is fucking ridiculous i had one driver with 6 dnfs on the 12th race  im not pushing too hard theres nothing that i can see thats causing it but what i can tell you is the season is ruined when you replaced the entire drivetrain 3 times halfway into the season  there needs to be something a bit more outlined that causes my driver to literally always crash if i dont tell him to drive at snail pace

#####

pitstop crew training mini game needs a rework doesnt work well crashes are still just as bad as f1 manager 22 very unrealistic poor piastri needs drivers update patch

#####

very good improvement on 2022 if you enjoyed 2022 this is a good increase in difficulty without being frustrating

#####

i wanted to play this years based off of there have been some improvements and honestly there have been 

but the regression in some areas out weighs the small improvements 

i like playing the lower teams and building them up over time i have been playing f1 manager games since 2000 and still nothing compares to microproses games the fact that being able to get more sponsors is not in the game amazes me how can a game from 2000 be more indepth than a game in 2023 yes i get that graphics have improved and take up a lot of the programming but how about we focus on all aspects of being an f1 manager before we try and make it a fancy looking graphics simulation thats what the f1 racing game is for 

dont even bother trying to be one of the lower teams youll just get fired i didnt even make it 12 a season with alpha romeo and then once you get fired thats it you cant go further like thats the end of your career as an f1 manager youd better not tell binotto that 

as i posted last year this is more of management game of click and shot not indpeth enough and is broken to think that f1 managers of lower teams would get fired for poor performaces if that were the case haas would have had 10 managers by now 

has potential but i highly doubt it will be any good ever

#####

note my experience is from playing career mode with williams

this is how you make a sequel to a yearly title
everything theyve changed is better it looks better the flow when the cars are moving and when stopping unexpectedly are better the simulation is better the radio is better
the practice sessions are more fun with the change of how the optimal range is shown the races are more intriguing with the changes to driver confidence and attack and defend orders the part development is more interesting with part health and inspections 
no mtx no season pass no fomo just fun

now i havent given much time to the race replay and scenarios because it isnt my focus but im sure they will come in clutch after i have gotten tired of the career mode when you got tired of career mode in f1m22 the game was over

only negatives ive seen so far is that the cars still turn rather sharply now and then the very pretty helmet cam moves too far from side to side to be realistic and the cars shake back and forth when battling which breaks immersion somewhat but they are all cosmetic issues

i am in love with this game even more than last years if they keep this up this franchise will be the best management series ever

910

#####

no improvement over previous game same terrible race simulations and lack of responsiveness that you might expect from trying a new strategy because the ai do not suffer from tyre deg so fresh softs are not faster than 30 lap old hards somehow a big step backwards

#####

game crashes a ton not complete none of the qol updates had been received at the last lap almost 200m to the finish line a guy who is behind you by a margin of 04sec finishes the race before you by 02secs and theres nothing wrong with your car trust me complete rebranded version of f1 manager 22 theres a better game called motorsports manager and i strongly suggest that you should buy and play that game instead of this one

#####

somehow better than watching broadcasts

#####

like the game but they need to allow you to turn off firing on my mclaren save there is no way to avoid getting fired and i just end up redoing the races over and over again i just want to play the game and enjoy it not have to repeat the same 5 races 100 times it would also be nice if they allowed you to change driver ratings because this would prevent so many people complaining about the bad ratings

#####

so many glitches i feel its even worse than last year

#####

game crash a lot

#####

i am really enjoying this game alot it focuses heavily on races and less on the out of race stuff even though this makes sense i would prefer to do more outside of races to raise money and other things despite this i am really enjoying it another minor quibble is it is not 100 voiced sometimes the radio comms is just text  again this is minor i really like this style of game and there hasnt been a good one for a long time this is a great one

#####

game is always freezing everytime i play to many bugs do not buy

update game makes me crash almost every race when im not even pushing and on fresh tires

#####

bugs and other nonsense cars running out of fuel because it sometimes doesnt save the fuel settings in quali
not to mention the fact the tires rarely go into the temperature window on the outlap 
expect to get blocked if you dont time it right in q
 
ui bugs 1 out of 5 races you get stuck in a ui element midrace and have to close the game via task manager awesome
a lot of mayhem  11 cars finished the jeddah race in my first season

spa is a track with easy overtaking well not here stay on the cars bumper  on the straight while burning ers with drs open  its perfectly normal

#####

surprisingly fun and very compelling race graphics a bit clunky but doesnt detract in the slightest

#####

literally the same version from last year except they spent 365 adding a pit stop interface disappointing dont buy if youre expecting a better game from last year

#####

its not even a patch of f1 manager 2022  its much worse 

as with all yearly release cycle games it focuses on the wrong parts to improve no thought to the actual career mode lets bang out some content that only people who pay extra can get developing the car is not rewarding at all nothing like the first game the ai are janky as all hell and still choose to ignore blue flags constantly slow cars become rocket ships for no apparent reason at random points in the race closing down a 5 second gap and then slow back down to normal when they overtake to top it off it crashes whenever i hit a sprint race and whenever i hit the finances tab 

really disappointing dont waste your money just play 2022 and have more fun

#####

so i overall really enjoy this game as an f1 and sports sim manager fan and its definitely a step up from last years  but it has some issues that i could probably overlook if it wasnt for that 55 dollar price point

the cars seem to much on rails for a game with a aaa price  even though i have to admit the game is gorgeous and the new helmet came is pretty cool

i really wish the drivers had more personality and independence  one really exciting thing about f1 is when the drivers ignore team orders and sometimes they get it right like carlos sainz ignored his pitwall to get his first ever win in silverstone last year  this game they are robots just waiting for your commands

another wish list item would be for this game to have multiplayer because they could make up for the sometimes weak ai

so overall i do like this gamei would guess i am the target audience but its just impossible for me to recommend it this price when you get a feature rich football manager for 5 bucks more  only get it on a steam sale

#####

fraudulent broken game buyer beware
bug after game changing bug another con job from these guys well done boys get to the second last race in the season  already had gone over my cap because piaster couldnt keep 4 wheels on the tarmac so forced to buy emergency parts well i keep purchasing them  the same parts yet the are not showing up as being available to put on the car  this forces you to buy the same emergency part again and again in the end i just gave up that as well as the qualli bug that makes ur car either come in earlier than u wanted or makes you stay out a lap longer than planned so you end up running out of fuel  that on top of all the other issues this game has its a a disgrace  you con artist of a company will not ever purchase another tittle of you mob ever

#####

they have destroyed this game
1 qualifiying cars wont move just silly gameplay slow running on racing lines and no penealties for it
2 first 3 laps of the race ai can run flat out without tire temp penalty
3 parts breaking after 3 races really
4 the amount of silly crashes destroying cars constantly thus over cost cap before season is over
5 lets not even talk about the penalties my driver has had grid place penalties every race for 11 races now cant even see why he got one or a replay of the penalty or stop him from getting them destroys good quali and puts you off before the race even starts not that it matters he crashes most of the time anyway f1 best drivers in the world
6 doesnt feel like anything you do during the race makes any difference you have your finish spot and thats where you will end up pit stop strategy seems to have no effect on race results

they have taken the fun out of f1 manager which is sad

#####

unable to finish a race since the last patch freeze then crashes mid race

#####

constant crashes and bugs quite unhappy at the moment

#####

i actually like the game overall and think a lot of the negative reviews are slightly harsh there could be some improvements for driver stats and development more interaction with them and a lot of annoying ui issues but overall if you enjoy f1 and managing a team then the game is worth it probably better if you can wait for a sale

its basically motorsport manager with less features but much better graphics and inrace immersion

however there is currently a gamebreaking bug where researching new parts for next season simply doesnt work if you change any variables in the research screen this one bug has stopped me from playing altogether until it is successfully patched the latest hotfix has not solved it

i will probably change this review to a positive recommend when this is fixed

#####

f1 manager is a fun game if you are person who can deal with constant bugs sometimes when you get a notification mid race optimal pit stop crash on track etc ui just bugs out and you cant click on anything only option then it is to alt f4 if it happened only couple times i could deal with it but constant bugs in this game makes is not worth the money in my opinion
even after new patch nothing has changes not sure if they even mentioned it even tho it is a game breaking bug

#####

so buggy and garbage looks like the game was made by a shitty ai dont buy it

#####

its a rerelease of an old game motorsport manager which is on steam for 2bucks the old games got alot more content i bought the dlc for this thinking it would be the extra content  wrong so with this your buying a 2 bucks game with less content even with dlc for upto 60 bucks all you get is better graffix
sorry but feels like there just milking the money

#####

love it


#####

got pole in the first season with williams in the rain 1010

#####

amazing game actual race strategies make it more real

#####

great game for f1 fans

#####

neat

#####

great game so far

#####

solid game and a solid improvement over the previous iteration worth 55 mmm thats subjective but i can see myself with hundreds of hours in this game so for myself id say its worth it if its on sale id 100 pick it up


#####

meh better than last years effort but still mediocre annoying that the widescreen ui does not work like last years game come on where is the testing also big issues for me are with cars that seemingly lean too much on the suspension especially when they change direction quickly and the crashes which are terrible cars coming to a halt from high speed etc also had cars hit barriers and seemingly just rejoin the race with no pit stop wtf feels like a cash grab  all that said i am an f1 nut and will still enjoy my time here recommended only to other f1 nuts

#####

qualifiers need to be fixed but other than that a massive improvement from f1 manager 2022

#####

i am running ruining the mclaren team we suck

but we do have the quickest pit stops

#####

h

#####

fun to play

#####

well this is an upgrade from the 2022 version  a little more immersive  as a huge f1 fan this is very satisfying especially when f1 is on summer break right now  i really like how they have improved the crashes still not perfect but better  the additional helmet camera view is very enjoyable  despite all its improvements they truly did no justice to nick de vries so far every race ive done nick has crashed out every time lol  the game truly did no justice for the rookies logan might have gotten the better end of the stick as he only sucks but has not consistently crashed out  overall it is worth it if your a huge f1 fan and want to manage and dictate the outcomes of the races and watch the cars do its thing on track

#####

a big step up from last years game engine sound still superb and the simulated driving with drivers cameras are almost perfect a ok management game with a very good f1 experience

#####

much better than 2022 they still need to work on a few things the biggest issue ive run into is they fight like its a race in p1p3 sessions and it always results in crashes ferrari have good strategy so defiantly not realistic lol  theres still no driver moods such has reigning world champ  broken wrists etc its more challenging than 22 was sightly better graphics on track the garage and podium scenes are copy and paste no newey fallows bonnington etc on podiums still aston martin doesnt start with infinite money like lawrence has overall its a lot better and would recommend if you liked mm  id say 39 out of 5 stars

#####

great game

#####

after last years release i was pretty sure i was not going to buy this one but it took about 3 hours until i was weak and bought it anyway

obviously i did not expect it but i have no regrets so far this is a much more interesting experience than 2022 so far its tiny things that keep me coming back so far by the looks of things there are plenty of reviews going over all of these small things so ill just give you what is the biggest improvement for me it is now possible to let a contract start the next year and i dont have to fire someone on the spot if i want to improve my team such a basic thing for any management title and i cant believe they got it wrong last year but here we are it works and it makes me happy

for all other small but important improvements please see other positive reviews

to me personally it was clear that this was always going to be a yearly released title comparable to titles like football manager and cycling manager but the way this was handled by frontier was just incredibly stupid with an anger inducing message going out and a rectification that caused even more anger once the 2023 iteration was announced the yearly release can be defended but the lack of transparency can absolutely not be defended i have to think of a dutch proverb here gentle healers make stinking wounds by not being clear about their intentions in the first place they received much hate by being who somehow thought it would be viable for a developer to keep support up for an application that was supposed to be deprecated by this new iteration

when in doubt wait till this goes on sale if you did not buy 2022 i would definitely recommend 2023 if you did you will have to see if the small qol improvements make it worth the purchase for you

#####

should just updated the last game never the less for some reason much more enjoyable than the first game


#####

1110

#####

much more difficult and a massive improvement on last years game

#####

a great game the crashing is gone for me and the game is fun

#####

verstappen didnt want to join my team so i took his engineer he is stuck with adami now slow button on we are checking

#####

it looks nice but its super boring there is not really anything to do or manage
you basically only watch the cars thats it

#####

my ass is itching

#####

fans of sim games should find this quite enjoyable a sizable improvement over f1m 2022 still some critical bugs to work out  but once those are taken care of should be smooth sailing 


#####

big improvement from last game the crashes arent that realistic but they are still good 810

#####

it definitely improves on the past game in all aspects but does not really include as much as i would want however i loved the first game so i was probably gonna buy this anyhow and it is still a young franchise and i am looking forward to future games

#####

good

#####

first yes its an updated version of 2022 what are the specific gameplay features that make the game fun despite its flaws is there any indication that the developers plan to continue improving the game beyond patches are there any notable differences between this game and f1 2022 besides stability what are the specific improvements in the upgraded version compared to f1 2022 
is the game worth buying even if it is not the best or greatest game there is
but it feels and plays stable no crashing so far or strange bugs that are gamebreaking 

can this be an upgrade version of 2022 sure but again its a licensed game you do not like that then dont play it or better do not buy it 

they going for the long run of this game with some patches then stop like the fm manager series still if you do not like that just dont buy it its that easy people is the game great i mean gameplay no but is it fun sure it is and take some hours of my time off to play it will i revisit this game no waste of money no i love f1 and i love managing it its not the best or greatest but they are in the right direction nobody can be the nr 1 in this genre this is the third or 6 game so far ever release so not many options you have for this sure you can buy mm and yeah its better but outdated and a classic that was also not well received when that was launched but it is what it is and its the beginning of this genre so they compare it with it visual is a treat and you will like that but the manager aspect is a little meh tbh here you need to like it if you do not stay away and play the f1 2022 if you have it if you want to support buy it lets see what they can make better next year

#####

loads better then fm22 enjoying it being more difficult too

#####

a solid upgrade from 22 races feel more natural and crash realism is improved lots of little quality of life improvements that add up massively difficulty better balanced meaning a return to glory save now needs years of planning

#####

me like fast car

#####

what f1m22 was supposed to be

#####

if you want to buy it wait the sales not worth to spend over 10 for this shit motosport manager is way better you need to do more research before release f1 manager 2024 because it ll be the 3rd shit game in a row

#####

it has many bugs the images of the teams and pilots are poorly cropped at the end of the race sometimes it takes you that a driver who did not win won for example the podium in the race it was verstappen pérez and leclerc and he put de vries as the winner the camera in the helmet when the sun hits them from the front it pixelates the game freezes quite often every 4 races 1 crashes its quite unfair that they charge you for a game with so many bugs from my point of view edition 22 was more stable they should put levels of difficulty because once you get into the developments you can quickly put yourself in first

#####

its better than 22

#####

its fun

#####

good game

#####

good

#####

good game few bugs still but still works wonders

#####

good

#####

lovely game graphics are insane but very hard recommend you turn the difficulty down at the start

#####

not better than f1 23 but yeah its really good 


#####

very pro game i would suggest buying manager 24 if you are into formula 1

#####

1010 would sack de vries again

#####

logan sargeant will crash any car you put him in

great game

#####

game is decent playable doesnt feel like alot has changed since the last game the whole tire not having an impact seems to be there played as a mclaren had softs on got over taken by a tauri on mediums softs were only a couple of laps old the ai is actually insane teams in the bottom half voting to give the top half more money ect cars on blue flags not getting out of the way

then theres minor things like when parts are degraded not being able to swap them out for the same part build but needing to swap out for a different one

red bull dominance in real life isnt replicated in the game not sure if this is bad aiprogramming or bias but 1st season red bull were consistently between 3rd and 5th each season

honestly think they should have saved themselves some money and us and just updated the 22 game since theres that little difference and just as many bugs and issues

but if you can get it on discount worth the buy if you havent got the previous game

#####

big improvement over f1 manager 2022 and big improvements coming soon
