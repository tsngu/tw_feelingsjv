as the years between new ace attorney releases get larger and larger its very uplifting to see more and more indie studios try to fill the gaps in between the wait murders on the yangtze river is the newest who dun it murder mystery game with heavy influences to said franchise but it also manages to establish an identity of its own through a cute artstyle rich descriptions of chinese culture and a style of pacing that helps the structure of each of its 6 cases feel unpredictable

its not just ace attorney that influenced this game yangtze river is clearly appreciative of all sorts of murder mysteries taking the time to detail a rigid unlock able glossary detailing murder methods court systems autopsy methods and more the studio also constantly takes the time to mention great detective novels of the past like holmes and uses chinas fascination of murder mystery in the early 20th century to set the tone for several of the games characters there is a true love of the craft here and thats just great to see

as such the murders the player will discover feel rather well crafted in terms of complexity and structure cases 3 and 4 particularly used some neat tricks that may have the potential to rival some of the great murder mystery games out there for some the downside is that omegames studio possesses such an intelligent grasp of murder forensics and history that if often lets itself get over immersed in the smaller details behind how many things can happen that it runs the risk of alienating the player to the simple executions of its actual crimes it also doesnt use visual aids as often as it should to help show the player exactly how these crimes are being committed as such there were a few cases when i only understood about 90 of what actually had happened by the end and while well touch on this later the translation itself also doesnt do the game any favors when these moments happen

also while the murders are interesting the grander narrative that this game tries to build while leading to an interesting place feels like it constantly gets derailed by other unrelated cases on the way only really building the details of its larger narrative by the games final two chapters and without feeling like there was enough setup to make the payoff feel as great as it could still the ride to the conclusion will still be worth taking although it seems likely that the team would like to create a sequel to continue furthering its characters

speaking of which while shen ah fu and wen ke are certainly leads worth rooting for the supporting cast sometimes feel like they lack the same eccentric personalities that youll find in aa or danganronpa that can often keep you from connecting or caring about them as much because often times these supporting characters will feel like no more than cogs in the machine of a murder mystery here to deliver one fact and then be gone for good it would be nice if the game took a page from ah fu who is easily the games strongest character to get more characters to pop still the games not without a handful of good ones and in one instance a cases twist actually bummed me out because i found that i cared more than i realized the only other thing worth noting is a plot device of shens character that is hinted at throughout the story that in my opinion goes absolutely nowhere and is easily the most disappointing part of his character

the art style is very much its own reminding me of the cutesy looking characters from something like a vanillaware game with a much smaller budget when the game uses its models to depict crime reenactments i find the style to be at its best as the models almost feel like toys playing out the crime the artwork for the close ups is also good and occasionally takes aa influence to give repeat animations for characters like ah fu smiling or looks of agony when an incriminating piece of evidence is presented to a suspect you wont find anything close to a classic breakdown sadly the music is also good but may lack a showstopping track that youll want to play over and over though the objection theme and the studios take on a cornered theme definitely come close

the logic and gameplay itself are also quite good while tyrion cuthbert an indie game from last year borrowed heavily from the original aa trilogy yangtze takes a closer approach to something like the spinoff duology ace attorney investigations keeping you for most of the game anyways out of court closely examining crime scenes interrogating suspicious people and even occasionally solving some light puzzles like measuring out a liquid formula or connecting a series of light switches in fact while you will cross examine people several times you may be surprised to find that it doesnt happen quite as often as you might expect this keeps the game play variety rather fresh and often times a game play sequence wont even repeat itself its certainly one of the more varied murder mysteries out there the logic itself while not impossible to follow will require a fair amount of brute forcing and in one instance a puzzle that required me to pick out multiple pieces of evidence at once to theorize how a murder device was created tipped me over to my only use of a guide or since one doesnt exist at the time of this review a community post stick with it however and youll appreciate the variety 

however perhaps the extra brute forcing came from the games biggest problem while this game is certainly worth your time if english is the only language you speak then a rather muddy translation may stifle your ability to get full appreciation from the stories largest moments its a problem that goes beyond simple grammatical errors and punctuation character names change from basic english names to their best translated chinese names randomly throughout the story making it often difficult to keep track of which characters are being referred to sometimes the game will refer to the protagonist as chung shen and other times john sometimes his assistanat ah fu will be referred to as franklin and the player is just left to interpret who it is that the game is referring to on top of this when details are left to the specifics the translation can often struggle to fully explain what its trying to say i recall multiple instances of a murderers motive being difficult to understand through the translation because sometimes the lines just dont flow like the proper spoken english language characters will speak about the person they are speaking to as though they are not even there very often words will double up on themselves and sometimes i just flat out have no idea what the game is trying to say also i encountered a single line of untranslated dialogue in the second case it is far from a deal breaker as one can still understand the gist of the story and reach the end without many problems but the lack of polish in the translation will keep some from being fully immersed and probably kept this from being a truly memorable experience that ill be playing over and over this is a small team who have indicated from the start if players detect any problems they should let them know while i feel that the issues with translation may go beyond simply identifying key errors and realistically could benefit from an enhanced translation altogether to speak on this any further would be insensitive to the level of passion that was clearly put into this game

murders on the yangtze river is not the best indie murder mystery game ive played but it is definitely one of the most passionate ones if you cant get enough of murder mysteries then the games 1516 hours of sleuthing will be a worthy addition to any ones murder mystery collectionjust be prepared to deal with a rough translation if english is your only language

#####

if you guys make another one of these pointandclick detective games but set during the tang dynasty or song or han or whatever i will love you foreverrrrr i want to play as di renjie 狄仁傑 during chinas golden era

#####

completed the whole game in chinese 6 chapter and about 20 hours of game time definitely very ace attorney with its concept of investigation debating finding contradictions and presenting evidences 

things i like
 very good music and atmosphere you can already feel it when the game starts almost after every chapter your steam ship will also move through the yangtze river to other parts of the country which shows beautiful hand drawn landscape follow by chinese poem that describe the view

 great voice acting china is a very big country with lots of diversity even though they might speak the same common tongue pu tong hua different part of the country has their own accent and slang even the british accent is there

 interesting story and cases some involve chinese folklore and superstitious some has twist towards the end

 get to learn a few interesting history facts of that era a bit of their lifestyle and even interesting laws under qing dynasty

things i feel can improve
 like most detective game some parts of it just dont make sense or hard to understand sometimes really dont know what evident they were asking you to present ended up just trial and error or maybe its just me

 i play in chinese so not really affected but what i saw from the trailer and ending credits most if not all of the characters has english name like john will katherine dan edgar etc i can understand if the character study aboard and has english name but common chinese folks in that era shouldt be having english name at all its very immersion breaking

all in all a very good game anyone who enjoys ace attorney series should definitely try it

#####

this is a review of the whole game played with the english language setting

the good
 beautiful soundtrack that skillfully combines chinese instrumental music with bgms youd expect to find in an ace attorneystyle game very atmospheric while still fitting the detective side of the game
 fantastic voice acting all voices fit the characters and the actors seem to be skilled professionals a joy to listen to i particularly enjoyed the segments where the characters swap between chinese and english the british accents were surprisingly good also afus english was adorable 
 character designs animation and art is of high quality love how expressive some of the characters are this might be a personal preference but i found the character designs lovely and was looking forward to meeting new characters in each case the main cast looks great as well and the extra outfits you can choose from are a nice touch
 the cases are very fun and well thought out there are some good twists and some moments were exciting to go through cant say too much to avoid spoilers but the reveals make sense and are logical
 the setting is interesting and provides a lot of background information for the historicalcultural elements of the era the buildin glossary of important terms and events is a really nice touch and the background artwork sometimes feels like classical chinese paintings
 the price is surprisingly cheap for the quality and length of the game

things that could use some improvement
 the translation overall is good when it comes to conveying the meaning but needs another round of polish i think the translation team decided to change the naming convention of the characters midway through translating so you can still spot some leftover old names here and there especially in some evidence items i spotted a few grammatical and punctuation errors as well but for an indie chinese game the translation is definitely above average considering the sheer amount of text in the game it was a very good effort and the english translation actually got delayed once so they could work on it more  great to see that the team cares about the quality of their game
 the voice recording quality for some characters is worse than the others  i suppose some actors might have used their personal hardware for recording the performances are all great so it doesnt detract from the game too much

overall i enjoyed the game a lot and even for the full asking price its a steal i hope the dev team will have a chance to work on a sequel as i would love to spend more time with the main cast solving the cases  enjoying the atmosphere crafted by the team its fantastic to see games like this being released also for the englishspeaking audiences  kudos to the developers for sharing their vision and chinese culture with worldwide players

this game follows a detective shen solving cases with his trusty assistant afu in order to gather evidence for a closed case that has haunted him for three years the creators were deeply influenced by different mystery medias including the ace attorney series i thought it was most similar to the great ace attorney chronicles and it shows in a good way it features a familiar game structure in investigation segments court proceedingsdiscussions presenting evidence and requiring suspension of belief for some aspects some cases had unique mechanics that were only found in those chapters from a quick debate to lengthier group testimonies

the cases themselves were not terribly difficult to get through but there iwerei some snags i ran into some of it stemmed from the translation choices which ill mention later while the rest just took me a second to step back and think things through the story often touches upon actual chinese history and had medical terms that i had never heard of before which i thought were interesting to learn about there are multiple bad ends that you can collect with unique art i havent gotten them all yet but some of the ones i did were quite amusing so i recommend trying different options to see them in total the main story can be about 1012 hours long

at the time of my review the english translation has only been out for a few days so some of the points i make may be fixed by the time others play

i was able to get through the entire game understanding the story just fine but there were some translated phrasesdirections that i think could be worded better for example spoilerin the third case one of the directions was to point out the place that contradicts with the signature which i thought implied that there was something wrong with the text in the untranslated letter but the answer was simply that the paper was creased when it should not have been spoiler 

 bedit literally the day after i posted this lol the devs updated the translation and the following point has since been fixedb strikeat some point during the story some of the characters were suddenly given english translated names which were then used interchangeably at different points in the story for instance sometimes chung became john ah fu sometimes became franklin and in one scenario lyu pi cheng became petra it was confusing as they had not been referred by those names prior and i had to figure out who they were based on conversation contextstrike at the end of each chapter there are untranslated sentences that i assume are like footnote poems i hope this and some of the achievement descriptions get translated in the future

overall the mysteries were fun to unravel and i found the lead characters very fun the music english and chinese voice acting and backgrounds were also very nice im really glad i put this on my wish list and waited for an english translation to experience it i would definitely play a sequel

#####

really fun game and im so excited for the full release
 the only criticism i have is that for a game set in retro china and a big theme already shown in the demo the conflict with westerners and their growing influence in china its a very bi interesting ib choice to give every character a western first name very bad localization takes you out of the story seeing john shen whenever your character speaks or to see someone trying to fight the western influence in china named harry or lawrence or smth
really hoping thats just an unfortunate try in the demo and it doesnt stick in the full game

继生化危机4以后第一个一口气打穿的游戏酣畅淋漓意犹未尽

6个案件环环相扣一个主线贯穿始终没有一个滥竽充数的案子没有一个可有可无的人物批评一下严重水时间浪费生命的的逆转裁判56结尾又有伏笔让人期待续作

背景设定在历史上最精彩纷呈百花齐放的晚清虽然封建却又十分自由的社会氛围营造的很好没有宏大叙事没有民族大义只是展示给了玩家一个个的人编剧水平不输走向共和最后一案子跌宕起伏堪比逆转裁判3的最后一个案子

玩法杂糅了很多游戏主要是逆转裁判但是删除了冗余的法庭威慑简化了调查举证很符合现在这个时代的游戏节奏推理上也不把玩家当傻子每一个证据的选择都是需要动脑筋思考的一些显而易见的矛盾都会直接说出非常尊重玩家还有小知识和史实收集涨知识

制作也可圈可点从第一章到第6章能能明显的感觉到立绘场景配音文本都在进步

2024目前最好玩的游戏没有之一

#####

id recommend this just for the soundtrack but everything about it is excellent if you liked the great ace attorney you need to play this too

runs wonderfully on linuxproton and on the steam deck as well

#####

first case is really good definitely a worthy spiritual successor of the ace attorney series reminds me of ace attorney investigations somewhat

will update if my opinion changes later in the game 

some notes

 benglish translation is found under the 2nd button on the main menu the 4th button on the next menu and the 3rd item dropdown box on the settings menub
 the translation is so far fairly good for a small team from china plenty of places where the translation could be improved but iirc the game has something like 800000 words hopefully the team commits a bit more time to improving the translation further but it is playable at this stage in the game
 controller support is 710 sometimes things feel unintuitive for example some text uses the left stick to scroll through and others use the right stick that said the controls do the job once you get a hang of them
 graphics arent very buttery everything feels stretched at 1440p
 really appreciating the insight into the lateqing era as a westerner
 the end of the first case reveals a set up for the greater story its very well done but puts a large expectation on the ending but other reviews seem to indicate it pays off im excited

if you purchase this game i hope you enjoy it as well

h3a better ace attorney game than ace attorney and probably the best episodic mystery game ive ever played
h3

this game was a labor of love and it shows the similarities to ace attorney are obvious but murders on the yangtze river stands head and shoulders above other ace attorneystyle games and even above the originals themselves 

i am going to do the game a disservice if i try to describe it in detail so i will just say this yangtze river is a brilliant thoughtful detective game that trusts its players without abandoning them when they get stuck because it trusts its players it leaves room for themand the protagonistto be clever and as a result it comes the closest of any game ive ever played to the feeling of being in a really good mystery novel

one thing that may give you pause is that chinese games often have bad english translations the english isnt perfect but on the whole it is very good more importantly the translation is thoughtful for example there is an english character in case 3 his chinese is a bit awkward and in the translation this gets rendered as ye olde english forsooth 

im three cases in and am blown away by this game so far i will update this review if anything changes but given the episodic nature of the game im already confident in this review buy the game

#####

更适合中国宝宝的推理游戏之前玩过逆转裁判123直观感觉上山河旅探的游戏体验更好更丝滑查证比逆转方便不少让人起码我眼前一亮的史实和小知识以及更细腻和更传统的画风从推理情节上来说也是一条主线贯穿始终最后是真的没想到还能升华到国家民族上狠狠赞了
最后十几小时的流程对比价格稍微显得有些高昂

#####

best game in the last few years

sooo good if you like detective game with amazing deduction story and plot twists you will like it
hope this games comes in english as well so that i can share it to my friends

chinese phoenix wright but wait a bit to get this one the english translation is like trying to read a poorly translated webtoon and is full of typos and grammatical errors 

i knew there were gonna be some issues early on especially when i saw the typo offcier in the very first chapter but im a slow reader and they had one section a debate format that cropped up in chapter 3 where it was just rapid fire back and forth conversation between two characters and then you have to choose from 3 similar sounding options while the other person is still going off on their argument or youll get a mark against you for taking too long to make a decision no countdown warning or for choosing the wrong option it already takes a little extra time to process what some sentences are trying to say due to the translation so to then force a speedy response was just obnoxious

aside from that there was a doubt that triggered early and told me how a dead body didnt seem to have anything to do with the missing bottle of red wine before i knew there was a missing bottle

and theres a time when you need to realize that an object is the reverse image of another object meaning theres two of them but the characters images are flipped depending on which way theyre facing so like a person will have a scar on one eye and then itll be over the other eye or broken glasses change which lens is broken so having a clue like that while i very hesitantly guessed correctly is not well designed

on top of that there was apparently an update to fix some of the english translations a little while ago im guessing thats when they changed dan to old chao how do i know his name was dan before
no theres even no need to write on the wall as there is an abunold chaoce of paper in the office
it is indeed more laborious and old chaogerous to work on the factory floor than in a laboratory
also known as why people should never push the replace all button

so my review is wait a bit 

im going to wait a bit as well before trying to get the remaining achievements especially because some of the ones i didnt get are in chinese so i have no idea what theyre saying

#####

this game is beautifully crafted from start to end the story telling is amazing with its timing and combination of graphics music and voice acting gameplay is also really good with the game starting you off with the basics of how case solving works and then simultaneously increasing the difficulty along with development of plot and introduction of backstories there are only 6 cases but feels like more considering the amount of time spent on actual deduction compared to investigation and discovering of clues its also based on real events and people from early 20th century china so you also get a free history lesson that doesnt feel forced

one criticism would be that the game is rather unforgiving if you are stuck on any part and have to constantly restart compared to ace attorney games where if you get a puzzle wrong multiple times the game will start to prompt you in the right direction this is compensated with its quick loading access so its a rather minor issue 

highly recommend for all players who enjoy detective and puzzle games

#####

played in english on the steam deck really great aceattorneylike from the character design to the music to the art theres a high level of polish in this game the cases are well thought out and the overarching plot fits together well cases are on par with the difficulty of the original ace attorney series playing this game you really can tell how much care this studio put into the trying to be accurate to the time period and to forensics i enjoyed the index that gives historical and factual context  

the voice acting is very professional including the english voice acting for the parts where characters speak in english one thing that shows attention to detail is that characters that in universe do not speak english or chinese natively have voice acting thats reflective of this 

while there are some errors with translation phrasing grammar spelling these did not impact my enjoyment of the game one thing that many reviewers note is that there are different names for the characters i believe afu is only referred to afu now and as for johnshen this distinction is also in the original chinese voice acting british characters or people who knew shen from london tend to refer to shen as john regardless of if they are speaking in english or chinese which makes sense as they know the character by his english name if you are concerned about the translation as of time of writing its certainly playable and it seems that the team is making improvements on the translation as well 

i have played a large number of casebased mystery games ace attorney dr rain code tyrion culbert avian attorney nina aquila to name a few murders on the yangtze river makes me excited for a sequel and to see what this studio can do next

#####

great game its similar to ace attorney in terms of the gameplay    the historical settingfacts that you can collect are very interesting and the overarching mystery they have that links the cases together is one of the best possibly the best period i have ever seen in a game like this  


#####

there is an old lady coroner character

#####

great game not a lot of puzzle games can combine mystery solving and history telling such well

#####

amazing game with a touch of history

#####

游戏开发者您好在玩游戏的时候遇到了一个问题用r快捷键查看相关史实知识后右上角仍存在红点需要再次点击查看同样的史实知识才能消去红点不知可否劳驾您解决这个问题呢

#####

good mysteries and interesting settings its rare to have whodunits that have unique historical settings and this one nails the era in spades obviously takes inspiration from ace attorney but has its own tone and is more grounded impressive work from a small studio definitely worth the price

#####

this game was fantastic i loved it the mechanics the story the characters the history tidbits how everything was presented how languages were used i really really recommend this game if you love a good mystery and love detective stories or the ace attorney series

#####

great story great execution such a good game the developers probably spent all their budget into the game that the marketing presence of this game is too little for its quality i wouldve paid 30 for it happily instead of 15

#####

murders on the yangtze river is an amazing detective game that does its own thing while paying homage to other detectivetrial fiction both historical sherlock and contemporary ace attorneydanganronpa likewise the game shows a ton of respect to the forensic part of detective mysteries as not only the game relies on a bit more forensic logic compared to pwdr but has a neat little glossary of forensic terms the game also cleverly incorporates its historical settingearly 20th century chinauk brilliantly in both the overarching plot and fleeting details you encounter the cases themselves were well constructed and clever

the ingame art reminds me of the cute web events of hoyoverse games like hsrgenshin with vnstyle portraits and aa style cutins the ost fits the scenes nicely giving that distinctly chinese vibe even if some of the tracks are on the nose with the pw inspiration the game also features quite a lot of voice acting i actually enjoyed that they dubbed the characters depending on which language theyre actually speaking ingame ch 3 spoilerits quite amusing to see auntie cheng give lip to the cop in crude english while being nicer to shen in formalassuming chinese spoiler

the chapters are a mix of aai informal cases and trials with investigation sequences in all of them theres also a surprising variety of mechanics interspersed in the chapters with some used only once most were fun functional and didnt overstay their welcome with the exception of one the main characters are developed enough with serviceable side characters the game does have a sense of humor and moments of levitytheres even a game over gallery but dont expect aa style witnesses

some issues i had with the game is the not so ideal translation bad sound quality of some of the english vas and some of its logic were a bit too advanced for me that i basically guessed to advance that mechanic i mentioned earlier expected you to reconstruct pieces of a mechanism with multiple blank boxes with a ton of choices multiple times too high iq for me the translation is unfortunate in this game because it took a bit of effort and rereading to quite understand what the game was saying at times which is particularly detrimental for this type of game i appreciate the game adding english vas in plot appropriate spots but some of the characters definitely sounded like they were recording with budget mics spoiler afu  ceces cute wizard of oz play couldnt distract me from the fuzz   spoiler

murders on the yangtze river is well worth the price and time10 hr if you got an ace attorney itch or just like mysteries in general

#####

chinese version ace attorney with very special art styles and great music

#####

incredible

#####

ive only arrived in chapter 2 but its actually a pretty good game so far
its a detective story that takes place during the final years of the qing dynasty
subtitles are available in english but the audio is exclusively in chinese
while this was admittedly unfamiliar at first now i think that this fact actually adds to the overall authenticity of the game

#####

john shen will always have a fan me

#####

i just started chapter 2 and this game is incredible if you are a murder mystery and ace attorney fan this game will meet and exceed your expectations one thing that really sticks out to me is the great pacing just when things are starting to slow down they pick right back up

#####

满分100分我想给150分的佳作 剧本完美跌宕起伏悬疑感拉满逻辑严密没有任何牵强刻意的地方细节非常丰富查案对证质证和辩驳的过程沉浸感十足真的是完美探案流程一步一步反复引导玩家思考每个角落和每种可能性步步为营的感觉很刺激很爽

整个背景设定在鸦片战争之后整个游戏里介绍的史实小知识还有办案中用到的专业术语也是一大亮点有种上了一学期中国近代史课程的感觉了解像磕肥陶高能这些清末百姓生活风物的小知识都很有趣在洋务运动的大背景下阿福作为一个崇尚格物致知的角色非常巧妙地融入到主线剧情里人物立绘都很精美唯一不足的地方感觉是pc优化方面偶尔会有点小卡顿但是几乎不影响体验

推荐所有喜欢推理探案或是visual novel的朋友玩希望不久就能玩到下一部

#####

有意思期待能有续作

#####

先从推理角度来说严谨的本格推理虽然个别举证的时候尤其是孔明灯照片有点让人摸不到头脑剩下的逻辑性都超强这个立意我要给打100000分每个案件的手法都有创新的地方但是最后的故事背景真的是发人深省而且各种情节设计一看就是符合史实的每个人物塑造我都超爱出一系列吧all in

90 of the game is pretty fun the setting early 1900s qing china is a lot of fun the cases flow together the game looks and sounds very good and a bunch of the side characters are excellent aside from the factory case none of the cases are particularly boring or tedious were looking at essentially a chinese ace attorney game with more bruteforce guessing than normal and not great case solutions 

the other 10 is pretty abysmal mostly interspersed into otherwise good or okay cases difficulty is mostly easy bordering on bland but along the way there are a bunch of extremely hardtoguess solutions that seem either impossible unfair or ludicrous plotlines and timelines that dont make any sense at all cases that sound like the writers arent sure whether the killer is supposed to be improvising or not 

it seems like several characters randomly act outofcharacter for their background or abilities a scrawny scholarly paymaster who spoilerbludgeons a man to death with a bag of coins and then drags his body across a factory floor culminating in trapping himself in an area of the factory where hell only be able to escape when a coworker happens to leave an unscheduled escape route openspoiler at one point the game asks you who could have committed a series of kills where a killer took a tremendous risk to plant 6 you will be murdered declaration cards on live targets now you might guess that the only person who would plausibly have the outlandish sleight of hand and theatricality to pull off six lifeordeath sleights of hand would be the suspect hiding that theyre a bliteral stage magicianb  or maybe a professional pickpocket or something but spoilernope its a random 15 year old crewhand whos working as a waitress who plants the murder cards while taking orders at a table when everyone is looking at her which is what people usually do when waiters approach a table making this just about the worst opportunity on the boat for approaching 6 people with as little attention as possiblespoiler there are way too many places where a crime requires unusual mental or physical ability to have been executed like it was and the game expects you to accept that an entirely implausible character has it without laying any of the groundwork to hint at it or set you up for it like theres one character whose murder scheme is unusually convoluted hinging on time of death analysis and sets this all up in a semiimprovised manner and works in a job where an exotically convoluted crime with forensic understanding would be extremely out of left field the only indication that this person is mentally unusual is that theres one sentence mentioning that heshe used to spoilergo to boarding schoolspoiler bthis is not greatb  

at one point the 15 year old crewhand spoilerimprovises a plan trying to trick everyone that the ship is in a different location by not slowing down when the captain calls the engine room to slow down by 50 in a fog and then committing a murder in the engine room while this is happening without any plan for what if the captain notices that the ship is moving literally double the speed he wants in a dangerous area during a fogstorm when no one in their right mind would be okay moving at full speed spoiler or what if the captain has literally any tool in the bridge for measuring speed or the engine settings  

on a positive note it does feel super believable that a firsttime killer with only rookie technical expertise would run into unanticipated problems trying to operate a system her boss hasnt let her use independently yet the steam valve oversight does definitely point to an inexperienced killer 

at one point a character plans a premeditated kill on a literal martial artist by attacking him with a frontal strike with a hairpin you might be expecting someone unbelievably confident in their combat skills or a stealthy operator nope spoilerits the 15 year old again the martial artist lets her kill him without resistingdodging because hes guiltstricken about having betrayed her years before but what was her plan if he wasnt okay letting her stab him to death just gonna die i guessspoiler 

at one point the detective guesses that the ninja spoilerwaitressspoiler will still have spoilerthe hairpinspoiler on her because he thinks she hasnt had an opportunity to dispose of it while on a boat in a fogstorm with 6 people she has already successfully sleightofhanded to make him look less stupid here id spoilerhave him skip to the killer obviously could have quietly disposed of the weapon if they had wanted to but she chose this weapon for sentimental reasons and i suspect she kept it for same if you want to be very flowery this killers as sentimentally attached to her one last family possession as a samurais katana or a gurkhas kukri of course she wasnt going to throw it awayspoiler  

the english version does a good job avoiding annoying or hardtoread dialects but id suggest going lighter on the chemists elizabethanshakespearean dialect this characters in the 1900s theres no obvious reason hed sound like frog from chrono trigger if thou knowest thou knowest the game mentions that the characters accent is useful for suggesting that he didnt spoilerwrite the suicide letter but we could figure that out without the accent a european chemist would probably not have much if any familiarity with the chinese mythologyfolklore referenced in the suicide letter and also classical chinese calligraphy is pretty hardspoiler spoilerthen again theres also no reason to think a random crewhand can sleightofhand six people or would come up with an elaborate plan to fake the order of deaths or the ships location and an english chemist randomly revealing that hes also a chinese calligrapher would hardly be the most ridiculous case solution in this gamespoiler

i got mixed feeling about this one 
the developers do have the capability to create a good detectivelogic battle game the game play is smooth the art style fits the storys background and the story itself is well organized considering the length of campaigns10 hours 
first issue is that it has too much of ace attorney within  
they did tribute to aa series in the roll card but at this level it already feels like a reskinned aa game
1 the game mechanics are almost the same there are probably 23 mechanics in logic scenes are new but they all appeared for only once
2 how they create climax in the story have lots of aa reference spoilerexample  the deduction on the ship the way they beat the man behind the scene are really similar to the context in gaa2spoiler
3 the music  bgm especially during testimonypursuitinvestigation i cant say its plagiarism or not but they sounds like the composers are asked to compose in the same style
   
the second one is all about the setting of story background
lets compare this with aa series
aa  a fiction world that the only thing you can relate to real world is the name of the country japanbritish and few characters that has reference in the real world 
so we know its story has nothing to do with the real world history the narrator can write any history events in the world and wont destroy the immersion of the game because players knows already its in a fiction world
however in this game the background was set in a world that seems like the real world during a specific period 1900 and it keep reminding players about real historic stuffs during play through with that it feels like a i historical fictioni 
one of the appealing feature of historical fictions is how narrators can explain or fill the blank in history with new perspective in a interesting way but not against the greater scopes of historical context
unfortunately the narrative falls apart when some of the real historical event started to heavily involved in the story progression spoilersuch as the inventors of cocaine the event related to qing dynasty opium abuse spoiler and it all mixed in a bad way that it destroyed the immersion because the greater scopes of historical context was deviated
its hard for me not to think if this narrative are driven by some specific political agendas

音乐画风很好质讯那玩法真的接受不了

#####

游戏本身质量很高除了音乐方面差了点很多时候很出戏以外挑不出毛病

但玩完以后怎么说呢更加体会到为什么逆转裁判是经典了对于司法的讨论我觉得逆转的度是把握最恰到好处的稍微有一点严肃但不失幽默夸张的基调这款游戏尝试在历史人文法律方面高度还原和映射现实导致他的深度有点下不去上不来况且游戏本身就不是讨论这些东西最好的载体体验就非常怪异不是很多东西一定要拍到你脸上才能叫有意义我印象大逆2最高英文评论说的就是ace attorney but racism但这种racism既不会让我感到offensive nor cliche和本游戏的体验恰相反

说白了国产游戏需要很长一段时间去define its genre不是说崇洋媚外但个人私心不希望是这种形式的overall i enjoy games for game itself

#####

found the demo by chance and couldnt wait until the full english version came out  picked it up the first day and am glad i did  really enjoyed all the individual mysteries and then the overarching story  great characters as well  love the look of the game and enjoyed the game play throughout with all the different types of interrogation and investigation  

cant wait to play a sequel  there is going to be a sequel right

#####

chinese version ace attorney the game play is very similar to aa series
9 hours for 6 chapters
overall the story is interesting and the graphic is good
the difficulty is medium but sometime is clueless
hope developer can create new deductive method and make own game speciality

#####

very good detective game

các vụ án được xâu chuỗi một cách logic và chặt chẽ
đồ họa và âm thanh của trò chơi tạo ấn tượng mạnh mẽ
nhiều nhân vật phụ nổi bật góp phần làm phong phú thêm trải nghiệm chơi
khía cạnh tiêu cực 10

các phần không đạt trong trò chơi làm suy giảm chất lượng trải nghiệm ở những phần khác
mức độ khó chủ yếu là dễ không đem lại thách thức đáng kể
nhiều giải pháp cho các vụ án quá khó để đoán và có vẻ không logic hoặc không thực tế
một số tình tiết và mạch truyện không hợp lý các nhân vật có hành động không phù hợp với bản chất hoặc khả năng của họ
chi tiết về lỗi logic

cách thức nhân vật dự định thực hiện một vụ giết người có chủ đích không thuyết phục
những suy đoán sai lệch về việc một nhân vật giữ lại bằng chứng hoặc vật chứng
việc sử dụng giọng điệu không phù hợp cho nhân vật làm giảm tính chân thực của nội dung

positive aspects 90

the setting of early 20th century china is engaging and exciting
the cases are coherent and wellconnected
the games visuals and audio are impressive
several side characters enhance the experience significantly
negative aspects 10

certain portions of the game are poor detracting from otherwise quality experiences
the difficulty is mostly easy verging on bland
there are several solutions to cases that are very hard to predict seeming unreasonable or absurd
some plot points and timelines are nonsensical with characters acting inconsistently with their backgrounds or abilities
specific issues with logic

characters plan premeditated murders in ways that are not convincing
incorrect assumptions about characters retaining incriminating evidence or objects
inappropriate use of dialects for characters detracting from realism
in summary while the majority of the game provides a positive experience scripting and logical flaws significantly diminish the overall quality

天下兴亡匹夫有责

#####

this game contains some of the best murder mysteries ive ever experienced very impressed

#####

很久没玩过这种剧情精彩探案解密过程不单一的游戏了很期待dlc

#####

great game for those who enjoy mysteries with the added bonus of historical notes for those who may be interested the graphics are charming no minigame stays for long making them always feel fresh the cases themselves and the overarching story are generally good i particularly loved everything to do with our main character and his brother 

only downside is that the english translation is still rough in some areas it has gotten a lot better though do note the demo appears to use the first english translation which has far far more errors than the full game

#####

a chinese ace attorneystyle game very well translated into english a few phrases and words are off but understandable and it has a good amount of content mysteries make sense and the cases are comprehensible i look forwards to more

#####

this was so so good you may think its just a chinese ace attorney game but there is so much substance the historical setting character depth and the complexity of the cases were all top notch and highly enjoyable you are in for a satisfying story whether its on a case by case basis or as an overall journey 1010 would solve murder again

#####

this has the right pacing that sometimes i feel is missing in the ace attorney series amazing visuals and soundtrack the facts and historical articles are just an icing on the cake each scene of ship travelling can be screenshot and it would look like a painting great job developers looking forward to their next exploits

#####

excellent genuinely well constructed murder mystery game this has the feeling of early ace attorney games 13 in terms of construction difficulty and complexity but with a lovely and clearly wellresearched period setting in the late qing dynasty this is closer to what i was hoping for but let down with the great ace attorney and im very glad that the studios made it if you enjoy this type of game this one is a mustplay

#####

a short but enjoyable detective game that tests your memory and reasoning  challenging enough that you need to pay attention but not brutal  failure just results in a reload but you may have to guess a bit to brute force the answer in these circumstances or reload the mission from the start and pay more attention  the music and art are charming i immediately stopped playing a torrented version and brought the full game  tldr short but enjoyable experience

#####

my salute  no 3d no amazing graphics engaging story and simple mechanic are all that takes for such a great detective adventure game  i am still stunned

#####

this is a case in which the overwhelmingly positive rating is a good adviser this game is my first experience in the detectives genre and it couldnt be a better choice the gameplay is fun and engaging there is a lot of content the artwork is beautiful and the experience is truly chalenging the feeling after crack the 1st case was as if it had been real i just cant see anyone disapproving this game

#####

definitely recommended

#####

absolutely missing the objection from this absolutely amazing roller coaster of a story

#####

first of all this is one of the best detective games i have ever played it is really amazing stories are connected with each other the art is good voice acting is nice and fitting both chinese and english and the knowledge background is impressive all of these creates a immersive environment which i enjoy a lot strong from beginning to the end and with a start that quickly pulls you into the setting and a satisfying ending with a lot of interesting and thought provoking details along the way and btw i love the opening for each chapter and im glad you kept afus lovely chinglish imagine everyone in old time shanghai speaking perfect british english how weird haha our favorite chapters were chapters were 1 and 4 both of which surprised us given how theyre not so connected to the main story but overall they serve and important role in building up the setting and characters we follow though the story

i can not recommend this game strongly enough and if you have any interest in mysterydetective stories this game should be on your list

and if anything needs to be improved it would only be the translation and soundtracks me and my partner played in english and there are some grammar errors that could affect the immersion of the game the bgm has a bit too few tracks that you will notice them repeating such as the deduction scenes however both problems are nitpicks and the english is serviceable but not great there were never any misunderstandings or problems understanding and the soundtrack quality is great just lacking slightly in quantity

overall a super strong addition to the detective genre oozing both in style and ability to bring its setting to life and a story that starts strong and keeps getting better at every turn with separate events both disconnected so that things dont feel forced or like every small coincidence was part of some grand scheme but also with enough details connecting even small things into the overall setting and story

#####

best game forever

#####

as a long time fan of the ace attorney series i can confirm this indie game is top of the notch of this genre

pros
 the story is well paced engaging and thought provoking i didnt encounter any filler content which i find a waste of time the many twists in the story offer enough surprises for you but remain reasonable and believable at the same time
 the gameplay is pretty standard of this genre which is a good thing with occasional minigames to spice things up
 the cases are well designed and i find that they present some real challenges without being unfairly punishing so if you are a fan of this genre youd definitely enjoy it i didnt find any loopholes or obvious logical gaps during my playthrough
 voice acting is superb i played in cn all characters are given unique personalities and are very believable its a delightful surprise to find out that the voice acting for each character is in the language based on their nationality accents for characters speaking a nonnative language is natural and believable
 the 2d art style is pleasing to the eye

cons
 music is fine but for this type of game you can oftentimes get stuck in a scene trying to solve a hard mystery which can make a music loop super repetitive would be nice if more variety is added
 movement in a scene is restricted to the horizontal axis which i find a bit too restrictive this linear movement makes exploration less immersive because most of the time you just wait for text prompts to show up and click it rather than actually interacting with objects in the scene would be nice if some freedom in the vertical axis is allowed so players have to actually pay attention to the environment and walk up to an object to interact with it

#####

good

we have our ace attorney

真不戳啊

#####

really nice mystery game that had a great story good music and fantastic character designs loved the tidbits of historical information i got throughout the game and its well realized world the art is gorgeous and i loved the extra detail of having englishchinese voices depending on the location you were translation was pretty good overall but there were a couple of typos here and there and some weird sentence construction at times never really got in the way though great game overall

#####

the mysteries are very well written and this is probably the best historical game ive ever played the scenery characters facts tab which is super cool the very well made voice over with the switching languages and accents and the overall atmosphere all work together to immerse you into the games time period the game regularly tests your brain and the overarching plot is well woven into the story 

100 does ace attorneys concept justice and even improves upon it with interesting characters and a great plot must buy if you like puzzledetective games

#####

附什么时候出dlc

#####

such a great game if you enjoy detective visual novels i found myself immersed in the story and i really enjoyed the voice acting and how they fit the characters such as to show accents when speaking english the difficulty is relatively easy at first but near the end did i feel like i had to do a lot of guess and check to actually progress i personally did not find the translation to be horrible but it could be improved mostly with old localization names hovering around time to time like when you see the name samuel ho as the character name yet they use the chinese name when referring to him i didnt really mind it though because translation is always a work in progress the background music was really amazing and at times of climax did it remind me of ace attorney specifically tgaa but looking besides their influences does the game still shines as its own creative letter to detective visual novels while incorporating chinese history im excited for what the devs will make in the future

#####

finished this game and have to say excellent storytelling and what a twist almost at the end of it great soundtracks likable characters and amazing story the only gripe i would say is some bad translation and the voice acting could be a bit better i also think they should add some sort of hint system to make it easier for players to figure out some puzzles either way i recommend this game solely for the interesting storytelling

#####

why is there no english dubbing in the game even though it in the pv is excellent additionally i am happy to see some improvements in the controller interaction

#####
