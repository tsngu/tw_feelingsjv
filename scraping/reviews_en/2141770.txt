it is a variation of 2048 with pretty art and soothing music it is decent for what it is but i think some of the higher level buildings can use a bit of greenery on every run i am inclined to have some low level buildings here and there otherwise the town quickly becomes a concrete jungle

#####

if you like tripletown urbo will definitely appeal to you if youre looking for something resembling a traditional city builder look elsewhere

#####

interesting take on the 2048 puzzle type games relaxing

#####

very nice looking merge puzzler  the backgrounds and buildings have a really polished look  as others have pointed out this isnt a city builder its a puzzle game  the buildings are only divided into levels and have no other function than to be merged to the next level building  if youre fine with that this is a good example of such puzzles  just dont expect a city builder or a variety of puzzle mechanics  you merge buildings it looks pretty thats it

#####

aim to support the needs of your people and your own aesthetic tastes thats essentially false it is just a puzzle game not a bad one as it does what it does well but the city builder tag is unwarranted would someone call tictactoe a city builder game if it used house symbols

people who use wrong tags for a game cause problems with negative reviews later and i should learn to watch a video of the gameplay before i buy a game

still you get a negative review for the deceptive line aim to support the needs of your people and your own aesthetic tastes and watch your city flourish and no it is a good puzzle game on its own and aesthetically pleasing

#####

this little gem of a game is capable of healing a broken soul relaxing meditative with an unique atmosphere stunning visuals and wonderful background music try it after a hard day and it will regenerate you im amazed at how a small game like this can make a big positive impact highly recommended 

#####

its not really a city building game is it its a version of 2048 with sizes of buildings instead of numbers where houses can somehow eat houses next to it to become bigger based on the description and images it looked like it would be kinda like islanders

#####

a combo between islanders and 2048 figured i would do a quick game to figure out the mechanics and lo and behold 15 hours are gone runs great on the steamdeck as well and is perfect to chill out with highly recommend it especially for the sale price cant go wrong with that

#####

i absolutely love this game i cannot say enough for this tile click connect 3 city creation game its beautiful keeps your brain active makes you think for me i play every morning with coffee and every night before bed hats off to the developer ive been playing this since the demo and never stopped i told my husband that i believe everyone needs to own and play this game make it part of your routine remember an active brain is a healthy happy brain this game keeps you thinking its relaxing peaceful and addicting

h1experienced on the meta quest 2h1

you can view my gameplay  early impressions here httpsyoutube7_jxyssfecc

this is a very chill relaxing city builder that works well in vr however there are some quality of life improvements that can certainly be made first and foremost the ui is pretty bad for vr not only is the text difficult to read but youre basically using your joystick to select menu items with these floating wheels its just a cumbersome system thats difficult on the eyes especially considering the type of game

the game itself has a nice artstyle that works well in vr its a super chill game to play the puzzle element is simple enough but offers enough challenge to keep it from becoming too easy its just easy to get into but theres enough challenge here for those wanting to maximize the cityscape 

game is running on the unity engine on my rtx 3080 i was getting a steady 90 fps i did not experience any serious issues or bugs during my playtime you grab to pull in closer or farther away you grab and move your arms side to side to turn around the play area for complete view of the area you can play comfortably seated and it is the preferred way to play all the interactions are of the point  click variety

fun challenging yet relaxing

#####

maybe a 2048 style game but boy is it super chill and addictive soothing music is great for late night wind down takes a few attempts at each building type to get use to each value 
hint hit tab to show the block number if you can not make one out
gets a solid 1010 from me

#####

i am normally a sim racer i delve into stuff like half life and super hot 
i was curious   as a designer the logo is excellent so i thought it was a good sign 
i bought this just to see i am astonished
 it is the most captivating simple  beautiful game  no adrenaline no energy its like playing chess with yourself stunning and calming  i have a very busy life and normally i rush though games i cant believe how much time has passed when i look up playing this 
just a sublime game
if you want to press pause on the world 
this game is for you

i cant recommend it enough

#####

really relaxing game with good visuals and music the different designs of the buildings look really cool and the gameplay is simple but fun

#####

on the positive side its cheap it does require a little strategy 

its a matching game you build 3x level 1 buildings to get a level 2 3x level 2 to get a level 3 etc you can match more than 3 but the minimum is 3 if the resulting building gives you another match ie 3x level 1  a level 2 building near 2 other level 2s you get a cascade

generally you fed a string level 1 or 2 buildings to place but occasionally theres a higher level building im not sure what the rules or limits are you can see the building youre currently placing and the next 4 in the queue so you can plan ahead a little

if you get enough cascades you get a special move like swap two buildings or place a relatively high level building

if that sounds really simple its because it is you do have to do some short term planning so when you make a match the new higher level building isnt in the way and preferably its near other buildings of the same level its not much though

the problem with urbo is that after about an hour of play youve seen all there is i appreciate the vr support but really its a short term time waster that gets old very quickly

#####

what a beautiful game this purchase is my thank you letter to the devs  for making the prologue game free n consider it as a 100 able game 

you get more missions  challenges  in this version
its a good game if you are a fan of a merge 3 city builder

#####

a peaceful little match3 puzzler with a pretty visual design and pleasant music i can see myself coming back to this when i need to unwind with something gentle and not requiring much thinking

#####

its a very interesting game the game will help you visualize your abilities as an architect and build your unique city will help you relax in the evening after work i liked the game i recommend it

#####

one of the few moments i am happy i have not bought a steam deck just yet not because a deck is bad but because i would never put it down when playing this game

id probably would have to say goodbye to my sleep because urbo is one of these just one more try games this is one of my favourite evening chill experiences i had already put days of playtime into its demo and its free brethren urbo dream one which only features one biome and island

if you like chill city builders like islanders this game will definitely keep you entertained as well

h1urbo  a relaxing puzzle and citybuilding delighth1

bi recently discovered urbo a charming combination of puzzlesolving and citybuilding that has swiftly become a cherished pastime for me from the moment i started playing i found myself immersed in a world of tranquility and strategic challenges

urbos rules strangely reminiscent of the classic 2048 add a refreshing twist to the genre urbos rules may bear a faint resemblance to the classic game 2048 they are by no means identical urbo introduces a unique and nuanced gameplay experience adding its own layer of complexity to the genre the intricacies of maneuvering houses with varying weights present a distinctive challenge instead of merging number tiles you find yourself orchestrating the movement of charming houses each with its own unique weight towards one another its a simple yet engaging mechanic that sets the stage for hours of enjoyable gameplay

what sets urbo apart is its diverse array of worlds and houses each boasting its own distinct beauty and charm as you progress youll encounter new challenges and unlock another worlds and houses keeping the experience fresh and captivating the visuals are not only picturesque and at the same time very simple but also contribute to the overall relaxing atmosphere that urbo effortlessly creates

i wholeheartedly recommend urbo to anyone seeking a leisurely escape and a mental challenge its a game that strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and complexity offering a unique twist on familiar mechanics whether youre a puzzle enthusiast or a casual gamer looking for a relaxing pastime urbo is a musttry let the soothing gameplay and captivating aesthetics transport you to a world where relaxation and strategic thinking intertwineb

#####

this game is incredibly relaxing if the developers planned to make the most relaxing game of the year i can confidently say that they succeeded graphics is just a bomb its peculiarity is not in the detailing but in the special smoothness very pleasant to the eye giving indescribable pleasure

#####

i havent mastered this game but ive played enough to deice to give it a positive review 

i like the art style the terrain and the buildings themselves lock cute and charming the menu is a little confusing imo but maybe thats just me  _ツ_

one gripe i have about the game is that if you dont earn enough points in one run to get pasted the stage youre in you have to do it all over again until you get a high score some would just say git gud and thats alright but i would like at least the option to have you score be cumulative that would make me want to play it enough to unlock all the levels because i dont have the brain power needed to play 4d chess in order to beat most of the levels 

still good game and i can recommend it to people that like this type of indie puzzle game

#####

urbo is an engaging puzzle game

ive also nominated it as vr game of the year

#####

great game with simple and chill puzzle solving where you can customize the architectural style location and time of the day to summerize the gameplay you place buildings in grids to form new buildings by combining 3 or more of the same kind with which you can create massive combos for more points furthermore as you combo you obtain cards that have different properties that can give you the ability to place larger buildings immediately swap their position and upgrade a single building some maps have some nice extra features to explore too

#####

very addictive and fun game i find it really relaxing to play this during lunch or when i get home and just need to chill it would be a great mobile game too however it is made with unity given what is going on i hope the devs dont go out of business because of unitys asinine policies

#####

please just add an option to back out of using cards if you accidentally click the button thats all you have to do

#####

i didnt expect that it would be possible to so easily and harmoniously combine puzzles and urban planning in one game it turned out just perfect moreover it is played very simply and interestingly just right for relaxation the game has very nice graphics which really pleases the eye all animations and the like are done at the highest level the sound is also perfect and does not interfere with the gameplay in any way as happens in some games in general i definitely recommend

#####

the 2048 of city builders sip on some tasty brews and get comfy this games got vibes

#####

the game is just a beautiful calming reflective experience the music is outstanding the art is smooth and fits the setting love the time differences and gameplay is easy to understand 

i would love to see the addition of a few more active elements such as people who come and go animals time actively changing as you play the board through and maybe some weather changes after an hour of working through a town i dont notice anything anymore but the numbers which is unfortunate since it is so beautiful

#####

trying to listen to podcasts but want to do a little bit of something while youre at it urbo is a great companion for that

 i unlocked everything in about 5 hours the gameplay is easy it gets your brain to work a tiny bit but wont require much focus allowing you to chill out think or listen to podcasts or whatever once youve figured things out its just a matter of finding creative ways to rack up combos

probably the first steam game i bought on release my mental was down and i decided to not go to work bought this on a whim and had a wonderful day with it

#####

its just 2048 with graphics

#####

urbo is a swell combination of something in the spirit of 2048 and match3 games

its minimalistic its not exactly mindblowing but what it sets out to do it does nicely all the while being easy on the eye just about perfect if you wish to unwind

#####

im not much for reviews just wanted to recommend the game because its awesome

#####

for the price of this game its an awesome little puzzle style ive seen people compare it to 2048 i would argue its not quite the same some similar mechanics but overall different
graphics are lovely atmosphere is great a generally pleasant experience would recommend to kill some time

#####

relax

build a city 

relax 

build another city 

relax

#####

ive only played for a short time but this game is calming and soothing it pulls one in and yet is simple enough that the challenges dont overwhelm you immediately it is not truly a simple game though  it is simple in design and its elements the complexity appears in how you play it

#####

i recently played urbo and i must say it was a truly captivating experience the floating islands and stunning landscapes were visually stunning and transported me to a world full of endless possibilities i found myself lost in the games relaxing music and meditative pace while constructing my city and solving the challenging puzzles urbos openended goals and diverse geometric fields made it easy to pick up and play for as little or as long as i wanted i was so hooked that i found myself playing for hours lost in a world of my own making

#####

2048 with nice graphics vr support and bunch of belts and whistles that make it slightly less repetitive than 2048

the only purpose for vr support is visual but it is enough minimalistic stylized graphics look great in this medium the only thing missing is more flexible camera control to help elevate neck pain from looking down in vr headset

works on reverb g2

#####

if you want to relax after a hard day of work this is the game for you you have to think a little bit but its not as challenging for your brain as dorfromantik which i also love though the ost also is amazing very soothing and relaxing

#####

whats not to like here a very simple and relaxing puzzle game perfect for chilling out and passing some time

#####

i just bought it and spent 7 hours playing it straight after purchase 
its addictive
yes
supports vr but has awkward camera control mouse is all you need for it

otherwise one of those games that swallows you and you dont even notice when your day has passed

#####

fun game 
relaxing in the sense that everything happens in your pace but you really have to massage them brain cells to get anywhere 
very simple mechanics youll pick everything up in 30 mins of gaming  then comes the tactics just like chess

#####

relaxing match 3 puzzle game where you can watch your city grow and develop multiple building sets and locations that become unlockable through certain score criteria well worth the price of 6 however i did get it on sale

#####

very relaxing open ended puzzle game with pretty visuals no pressure and easy to pick up and put down perfect for chilling out or killing a bit of time

#####

relaxing puzzle the graphic style music and gameplay are at an excellent level the only downside is that there is not enough content

#####

#####

ive seen done and gotten it all on a single rainy day but its a really lovely game and it was nice to unlock the different playfields and buildings sets

i hope this one gets expanded one day


#####

not a bad start i like the gameplay so far lets see what happens next

#####

elegant relaxing puzzle game 
good learning curve 
chill soundtrack
pleasing artstyle

#####

very satisfying and puzzling game

#####

this is not my genre clearly tbh was just passing by searching for something relaxing to ease the wait for the ea launch of the one famous fighting game i needed something nice and simple something neat guess what missed the release of the game ive been waiting for urbo is exactly what you need to chill

#####

pretty good light puzzle game and the different backgrounds and style combos is pretty cool its fun to figure out how to better plan out cities in advance and combo stuff

i dont know if im made of stupid and this already exists but i would like an easy way to access photo mode for cities ive already made and it would be nice if the perspective werent so fixed

#####

really cool relaxing game with simple mechanics and wonderful design vr supported

#####

finally waited for the full version how cool to unload my head after a stressful job start the game and without complicated tutorials just do architecture and build houses

#####

just chill and contemplate
a treat for the eyes

#####

its not actually a city builder so if thats what you want dont bother

#####

its like someone slipped threes a chill pill

#####

super chill and relax gameplay and in same time practices for strategic thinking
also amazing visual and audio environment

#####

surprisingly nice game this one engages you to make one more turn better than civilization

#####

here comes the release of urbo in fact the game as it happens has grown from a piece to a whole product meditativeness hasnt gone anywhere and thats great

#####

urbo is an innovative and exciting city building game in urbo developed by a team of indie developers players will build and develop their city over many levels

#####

a puzzling game huh you know ye

#####

the method of unlocking new locations and new building sets is too grindy always making you wrack your brain for maximum efficiency solutions thinking multiple steps ahead which entirely defeats its purpose as calm relaxing game

#####

looks cool gets bitches

#####

very relaxing and enjoyable game 100 recommended

#####

indie chiller killer of 2023 dont even  me

#####

great

#####

one time it looked likes my balls had three balls 

adn that way ud always have 2 spares

#####

nice and relaxing puzzle game which youd expect to be released for mobile devices so you can play to kill waiting time i cant recommend this for steam or vr though its not worth the effort

#####

a good puzzle to chill under some video in background

#####

i cant stop playing this please help me

#####

calm and atmospheric construction puzzle dominated by a meditative game pace relaxing music and minimalism

#####

cute little puzzle game very chill

#####



#####

 nice graphic overlay for 2048 also including several board shapes

#####

a fun small game that is well executed i play this for just 10 minutes at a time and keep growing my city very relaxing and enjyable

#####

great calm experience with a lovely art style the different building styles were nice enough that i wanted to unlock and see everything and theres a couple of nonstandard game modes for replayability definitely worth a look for the price

#####

a game that makes you feel like a genius

#####

its a pleasant game to play if you are needing something you can do while watching a show or just not in the mood to really do anything but you want to still work your brain a bit

#####

simple fun and relaxing

#####

if you liked islanders this is similar albeit with a little bit less variation

#####

simple straight forward and relaxing

#####

so relaxing yet so intense

#####

serene

#####

very fun relaxing addictive merge game worth it beautiful too music is nice and calm you can unlock a lot just by playing no difficult achievements

#####

simple and easy to understand with lots of strategy runs great and very easy on the eyes

#####

a lovely strategy game with meditative elements and a few surprises along the way  wanted to note that there is a prominent web review out there saying that this is a good game to play on your lunch break as it only takes 10 or 20 minutes  i think they may have missed the point  build complex matches to get bonus cards random choices to let you reorganize and enhance the board so that you can make more complex matches  i think my last game with three areas took about 10 hours  i wasnt in a hurry but i didnt ponder much either i also toward the end designed the look of the last city to be mirrored   so plenty to do to keep you occupied for more than 20 minutes  d

#####

beautiful simple game very relaxing

#####

a simple yet hugely repeatable game  its amazing how long it can take to work through even a 4x5 map grid  this game is kind of a combination of a citybuilder and 2048  graphics are phenomenal and while the basic rules are simple and quickly learned being able to think ahead in the right way takes some real brain power  you should buy it its inexpensive and youll get a huge amount of play time out of it

#####

a beautiful and simple little puzzler

#####

threes did it best but urbo is a very pretty and relaxing take on the format boards get smaller and more unconventional forcing some proper strategy nice amount of stuff to unlock too

#####

relaxing stunning challenging addictive  and dangerous 

i got it on sale i thought maybe i could check what this game is about maybe i can spend 2030 minutes but once you start you never end so this game will get you out of your world you cant sense the time you just get lost

watch out if you have a study or work you maybe can actually have no time for that once you click play

i love this game 3

#####

amazing environment design

#####

very relaxing  not hard makes you think just enough that you have to focus on the game but not enough that you have to use any energy for it  this is not a dis it fits perfectly with what i feel like the tone of the game is  ive only had it a couple days and im already opening it up to relax after bad work meetings

#####

relaxing quick  fun had a really good time playing it it is quite relaxing and simple yet it has its challenge and keeps you engaged

#####

so relaxing and probably great for wallpapers too

#####

urbo the proof that merge gameplay doesnt have to be synonymous with mobile crap basically its a highscoreoriented puzzle with a solid ruleset gorgeous aesthetics and no standard annoyances gets old pretty fast though

#####

good

#####

harmonic game and lots of simple fun

#####





#####

hypnotically beguiling 

#####

combine islanders with 2048  threes style gameplay and you have this perfect little casual citybuilder game

#####

its meditative and quite lovely if you get a few hours out of it which you canwill its worth the price

#####

this game is easy to play but hard to master it is peaceful relaxing and meditative i really love it

#####

amazing game very calming and the small elements of the double points or the level up area are great great design simple and beautiful easy to sink hours into would love to see it expanded with more modes and challenges as well as a global leader board because the scores mean nothing now

#####

出个自定义模式

#####

decent puzzler vr is very good

#####

its a fun merge 3 building game relaxing yet enough of a puzzle to stay interesting i like that you can change the visuals although it would be nice to have more choices

#####

chill


#####

like triple town but prettier and without the freemium stuff ruining the game play recommended

#####

nice little puzzle type game to sit back and relax with for a while definitely not a city builder even though you put up buildings so dont come in expecting any of that

#####

very chill easy to get into but hard to master great game to relax with

#####

fun to play and looks great too 

#####

relaxing

#####

music is very calming  game is very fun and peaceful


#####

very fun and chil game make you think like it

#####

one of the best time slip devices i have ever used i have turned  a 10 min break into an hour with ease the only drawback is the device only slips forward in time but its not much of an inconvenience when your enjoying every minuteit does force the user to calculate and use ones brain but i find this a refreshing change of pace highly recommended

#####

great chill relaxing puzzle city builder perfect to destress

#####

its threes2048 with buildings 

#####

its a match3 puzzle game if you like those this game might be for you
graphics are nice
rules are simple
achievements are harder to get since the boards are fairly small

#####

bro i love urbo

#####

if youre looking for a nice relaxing puzzling game with a zen atmosphere   this is it the mechanics are deceitfully simple to understand and still incredibly complex and satisfying to master

the concept is as such match 3 or more similar blocks together and they combine into a bigger block and repeat the cardsystem is a really nice little addition that can help turn a mess into a cleared up board allowing you to continue playing 

the animations are smooth friendly and not too much of a bombastic spectacle that would be distracting  and yet it scratches that dopamine itch whenever you manage to pull of a well thoughtout maneuver clearing the board or well even if it was an unplanned one  

to top it all of it also supports vr

tldr
 nice relaxing puzzling game highly recommend must get much wow

#####



#####

kind of interesting for a 2048 clone i kind of wish i could use these assets to play the normal 2048 kind of game but this is not too bad 

#####

really fun satisfying and peaceful clearly a lot of attention to detail a clever game i feel like its a sort of 3d take on 2048 in terms of the maths and the merging great fun

#####

a grand little puzzle game with some cool mechanics built into each map to shake things up
great to kill time and relax in the evenings

#####

nice

#####

chill pretty absorbing

#####

beautiful and amazing

#####

very chill and lovely puzzle game  great music and relaxed settings really hope the content will keep growing

#####

nice little game to chill out with so far so good

#####

simple and relaxing mergepuzzle game deeply chilled out experience well worth the price

#####

6 for 12 hours of truly enjoyable citybuilding well worth the price of admission if you enjoy islanders def give this a go

#####

fantastic laidback puzzle game booted it up and didnt put it down for the next 10 hours everything is very polished the mechanics are very easy to grasp without needing any sort of tutorial or guide looks beautiful and runs great compared to other similar games the game is reasonably forgiving if you pay attention to what you are doing and doesnt put too much pressure on you i think the devs nailed the balance

the best feature is the interactive map elements like the boat that loads up in increments when you complete buildings adjacent or diagonal to it and then gives you a bonus building upgrade when it leaves for the neighboring island there is also a tower you can raise for bonuses that works in a similar way would love to have more content like this i think you got a winner here

the music isnt my cup of tea and it got kind of stale eventually ymmv though

#####

townscaper with architectural range and scoreboards 1010

#####

this is a lovely atmospheric puzzle game with nice background music it is relaxing and yet you cant help yourself to just give this map another dang try lovely game whether you have a few minutes or a few hours to kill lovely and lovely frustrating

#####

#####

its a very beautiful game i have never seen that someone made so much out of something what is so limited like this content wise the music is so freaking great that only the tracks itself are woth it to buy the game if youre searching for some sleeping music there you go no need to say thank you but all in all nice little game to calm down and relax a little bit
9510

#####

absolutely love this game its cozy its chill its calm and relaxing the puzzle side of it is fun and engaging but not overly complicated and the bonus cards allow for some mixing up its accessible and easy to go back to play even after a long time of not touching it highly recommend for cozy vibes

#####

urbo is fun sweet with enough strategy to burn a few hours
however its not too hard to finish urbo either get all the cheevos and such more maps maybe some puzzle maps even some modifiers to the situation would be fun to play around with 

fun if you just want some turnoffbrain puzzle games

#####

good puzzle game much more match three oriented than city building in its main game mechanics very much inspired by the excellent triple town published back in 2010 httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp209950triple_town
in game ui feedbacks are my main complaint they should give you better guidance on the outcome of your choices

#####

my autism wont let me stop



sit back  relax nomination 2023

#####

addictive 2048 in a town planning concept

#####

nice visuals peaceful music depth to the gameplay relaxing and great

#####

quite interesting i like puzzles especially combined with very light city building havent gotten very far on it which is okay a challenge is interesting

#####

my new tetris  in full vr 

1010 for the price

looks beautiful  i can do res 400 with index in 80 fpshz  using an oced rtx 3090

#####

not normally into city builders and puzzle  this time i will make an excuse

#####

i wasnt quite sure what to expect from this game but it turned out to be a fantastic little casual puzzle game it has a great simple interface and the puzzle components are easy to learn but can keep you playing for quite a long time it works well on my desktop and my steam deck and it has some nice styles of buildings and locations to shuffle through as you play all in all i have nothing negative to say about this game its fun but easy to put down so its a great game to kill some time whether its 10 minutes of 10 hours

#####

great little game if you enjoy the puzzlestrategy genre i love the smooth graphics and the different type of buildings you can unlock what feels a bit of a let down is that there are two sets of maps that looks almost identical dunes and desert glade and valley yes archipelago and waterfall are similar but not almost identical like the other sets different environments would have been more interesting like snowice lava jungle underwater moon forest caveminerals etc there is definitely a lot of potential to expand the game since you will unlock the building and environment types pretty quick this game is to be enjoyed the same way one would enjoy sudoku nothing changes except the enjoyment of the game itself

#####

chill city builderpuzzle inspired by 2048

good puzzle game with pleasant audio and visuals 100 recommended for a cozy evening 12 hours game session

#####

a wonderful game in which we will build cities on floating islands many regions for construction this game also features relaxing music a meditative pace and puzzles and while you are reading this review i continue to play this game 9998910

#####

chill n cool game

#####

a colorful game with a fairly calm rhythm of passage you start small and then your city develops more and more so that you can move to the next level there is also vr support but unfortunately i dont have that in my arsenal the game is not expensive you can take it and relax in the game sometimes

#####

trying to build a composite tactics and logic of the arrangement of buildings but in the end you come to a dead end similar to the mobile application of adding numbers only here beautiful graphics very nice to play worth the money
