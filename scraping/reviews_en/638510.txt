i have been looking for a game like this for such a long time i am not sure i am good at reviewing games but i will try my best as i think this gem really deserves a review

b gameplay b
in this game you are a cranky elder making use of your pips pipsqueaks to build a village with the hopes of withstanding the apocalyptic events abound to happen this game does not play in realtime but rather it is turn based which means that you can take your sweet time in thinking about the best strategy to deal with your pips as soon as you click the end day button all the pips will then execute the task given to them

the game is a roguelite as in for every run you get a different skill tree and then it is up to you to make do with the hand that was dealt the developer has implemented some mechanism to reset the map but i like the challenge of trying to survive with what i have on the other hand this game also has memories once unlocked all these memories might become potentially available to all of the runs such as fishing each run is long i am still in my second one which so far has taken me 5 hours which i guess some might like and some might not i personally like it a lot as for me it is like i am playing a new game every time but at the same time i am not restarting a new village immediately

something else which i would like to add is that there are more than one elders which you can play with though i have not yet unlocked the others also at least for me this game is brutal lol but that is one of the reasons why i am enjoying it a lot and its humour as well

b steam deck controls b
one of the reasons i am usually hesitant to play these type of games is that i play exclusively on the steam deck handheld using the controllers and i do not like to use the touchpad either with dot age i am happy with the controls and i find them intuitive and easy to use at one point during my playthrough i encountered an issue where i could not click a particular box i let the developer know on discord and it was fixed on that day that was the only issue i had encountered with the steam deck controls another thing which i really like is that the game is constantly showing you which buttons to click i really really love this game design for me it makes the game more accessible and more fun

i have to point out here that i first had tried the demo and at least for me the steam deck controls did not work on the demo but you can rest assured the actual game controls are working fine on the steam deck

b accessibility b
i have already mentioned the game showing you which buttons to click but there were some other accessibility features which i made use which were both related to text i was finding it difficult to read the fancy medieval font but thankfully we have an option for normal text there is also an option for larger text an accessibility feature which i also used and i also appreciated a lot

the game also have game difficulties ranging from relaxed to the very difficult

b qol b
besides accessibility this game has also some qol which i found nice an example of such qol is that if there is a researcher but the pip was not given anything to research the game will let you know this qol was very useful for me as i always kept forgetting to assign new tasks to research

i also have to mention that this game has a very good tutorial i managed to understand how the game works just by following the tutorial and there was no need for watching yt videos to understand so far i have also managed to get by without googling anything as well and keep in mind i do not have much experience with these type of games

b graphics and music b
i am a sucker for pixel art games so this one is right down my ally i do understand there are some people who do not like pixel art but given the amazing gameplay of this game you might want to try the demo out and see if you like it

i also like the bg music it is very medievalesque

b value for money b
i have played for over 5 hours at the time of writing this review and i do not see myself stopping any time soon remember the memories i mentioned in the gameplay segment i have still not even opened half of them this game is not only extremely replayable but it also has a huge amount of events to discover and to learn in my humble opinion it is very much worth the price as once you get hooked you will get loads of game play out of it

b to conclude tldr i guess b
i have found it difficult to actually put this game down the developer said that he spend 9 years working on it and it shows the game was truly made with love and it is giving me so much joy to play it it is that game where you think ok one last turn and all of a sudden three hours have passed the developer is very active in squashing any bugs personally besides the minor controller one i have not encountered anything i hope we continue to get even more fun updates in the future

#####

i play a lot of games ive played over 150 in 2023 this one right here dotage was my game of the year in 2023 

dotage is everything i want from a boardgamey turnbased roguelike it expands upon the typical worker placementstyle boardgame by giving you a roguelike city builder with chaotic rimworldy world events colonists with unique quirks and mechanics and an everchanging world with tons of content to unlock and explore 

everything i just said is obviously great but what i personally love the most about dotage is how it masterfully implements meta progression into the game by giving you points to spend on new unlocks that then seamlessly integrate into your current existing run each time you play youre learning new mechanics seeing new features and learning new things all while still balancing that chaotic and terrifying world the developer has created 

my only flaw with the game is that runs are about 15 hours long but this is hardly a flaw when you need 15 hours to build the beautiful colony you need to survive the apocalypse and if you mess up and dont produce enough food or maybe you dont have enough health during that plague or maybe not enough heat in that snowstorm well you lose but you learned a little bit unlocked a little more and youre back into another run its a game that similar to civilization masters the art of one more turn you just have to see what happens with that doom event well now my tomatoes are almost grown but my baby is grown in another two turns so ill just play til then pretty soon your entire night is gone but youve enjoyed every second of it 

i cant speak highly enough about it its an amazing game

#####

let me paint you a scenario that just happened to me

its a hot summer evening my village had just narrowly survived a harsh winter we constructed a new bakery and mill everyone is happy and their bellies are full 

a few of my villagers decide it would be funny to insult my baker and cause him to hate the rest of them this will come up later

a heat wave blows through my town and lights one of my buildings ablaze of all the buildings that could have caught alight it was the village well 

this caused me to be unable to put out the blaze which subsequently spread to the rest of my village 
midinferno my baker decides to take revenge on the 4 other villagers that wronged him and murders all 4

the rest of the village burns to the ground with no survivors 

i love this game

#####

trust me when i say this is a work of love 

every detail placed here and there fits nicely in this cozy village with the uncertain future even late in night i did find some comfort when i played this game music is upbeat but calm the color are vibrant and warm everything livesthen dies

the game provides pictures of the floating world a fleeting reality that will have to face great calamities at that awaits but there hope at the end of the road

hope is not lost

#####

i bought this game two days ago and ive played it for 29 hours help please

#####

game is actually awesome if you like rimworld youll love this what i didnt like about rimworld was how you just always had to react to events but in dotage you get a bit of a heads up as to what type of event might happen and can take precautions perhaps even turning a bad event into a good one

for instance its turning winter and theres a coming chance of a cold event happening you can build fires and keep your villagers toasty and bam no negative effect actually they all just sat around and gained some knowlege
something like that 

anyway i plan on playing this one quite a bit definitely recommend to any village builder survival enjoyers

#####

ive played thousands of games throughout my life interested primarily in uniqueness this is an absolute gem and clearly a labor of love a core element of good game design isnt just coming up with features but meshing them in a way that is seamless to keep the user immersed in parallel and when i think of dotage there is music and there is music played with passion that draws you into the emotion of the musician i havent had a game grab me like this in years thank you for providing the gaming community with such a beautiful title

#####

if i had a nickel for every fun indie city builder game i own developed by just 1 person i would have 3 nickels which isnt a lot in the grand scheme of things but damn its impressive

#####

remember the end of the boy who cried wolf ever think maybe chicken little was right about the sky wouldnt it be fun to yell at the kids to stay off your lawn gamers who answered yes to any of these questions are likely to enjoy the delightful but challenging dotage

in this cutely animated turnbased strategic basebuilder players take on the role of a geriatric curmudgeon1 who fuzzily recounts his time as a village elder his tale alternates between anticipating ruin and attempting to stave off the same the old mans foretold doom arrives as a consistent series of disasters each keyed to a class of calamity a dark crow flies out of the forest spooking a villager fear someone begins to starve disease the wide variety of troubles that befall the communitysome predictable like a cold winter others not such as the aforementioned spooky corvidkeep the game lively and meaningfully random

the elder wouldnt be much of a leader if he contributed only portents of gloom and woe luckily hes also ready to construct and operate a city to battle the games various challenges wait correction hes ready to order other people to do the constructing and operating the crusty leader mostly just shakes his cane to the sky while shouting profanity as his knowledge is immense and his beard profound perhaps hes earned that right

what the villagerscalled pips likely short for pipsqueakscreate are logistics loops that meet their needs much like each maps building space food and raw materials pips are a limited resource and much as the elder demands collection of the former resources he also tells pips when its time to reproduce perhaps hes read his plato a healthy city must take care not to grow too large lest it invite war and poverty the elder a grumpy philosopher king

the pips commanded labors respond not only to their needs but also to the earliermentioned calamities fear for example is countered by hope which is created by pips spending time together in restful activities heat is countered by cold disease by health and so on the buildings used to create these counters often have adjacency bonuses with careful and welllaid logistics chains and good placement on the buffing buildings the elders village can weather increasingly tough challenges each time hes reminded that his peoplepippledidnt succumb to ithati catastrophe but theres always another ahead

few players of dotage will find victory on their first attempts in fact the game requires players to agree that they will fail perhaps repeatedly in order to play on even normal difficulty this warning is appropriate because despite the detailed tutorial the game presents unexpected difficulties and interactions in my first playthrough my village was blessed with a positive event all our bare berry bushes regrow their fruit amazing  except that i didnt know this could happen so id already dug up all the empty bushes to make space for new buildings alas as players continue to gain experience in the game theyll be increasingly able to plan for both events and building placement even with those elements mastered though theres still so much else to see and learn as the elder and his village survive increasing difficulty he gradually recalls more of his story represented by the player gaining puzzle pieces these can be accumulated and spent to unlock further game features some of which are substantial one early selection unlocks 37  new events others unlock buildings minigames and additional player characters

despite my years of experience with strategy and basebuilding games ive never played one quite like dotage if i were forced to identify comparisons id gesture hesitantly to the recent against the storm and two older games black  white and the mapbased part of the sness actraiser which i remember playing which perched on the edge of my moms bed my cool longhaired uncle brought over his game system and a pizza and he let me play the one while eating the other im sure i left greasy fingerprints all over his controller but he didnt seem to mind  sorry where was i right dotage displays a novel combination of mechanics theres nothing wholly new here but the assemblage feels unique which is a real accomplishment for a passion project game thats been developed and published by one person michele pirovano is a creator whose ingenuity and dedication should be lauded in todays crowded gaming space

replayability with randomized resource placement and challenges many paths down the research trees and tons of game unlocks i cant imagine uninstalling dotage after only one playthrough

recommended absolutely


1 someone should remind the angry old man of the promise of platos elderly character cephalus in truth there comes to old age a great tranquility  and a blessed release when the fierce tensions of the passions and desires relax then  we are rid of many and mad masters 329c ithe republic of platoi paul shorey trans cambridge ma harvard university press

#####

i cant believe that theres a city builder  resource management game that came out in 2023 that isnt either completely broken or in early access or both

 and its actually fun

#####

jesus christ i have played nothing but dotage since it released and when i stop playing im still thinking about it

i am blown away by how well designed this game it it is the perfect combination of strategy and screw you

if it seems at all appealing to you i strongly recommend it

#####

this has the highest one more turn syndrome of anything ive played in recent years never knew how badly i needed a worker placement board game in a single player digital setting

#####

as far as roguelitlike city builders go a woefully underrepresented genre i prefer against the storm ats is tighter respects my time more and its tension certainly adds to the experience theyre both workplacement city builders ats is realtimewithpause but i actually prefer turnbased models ill lead with that 

tldr below

that being said here full runs take quite a bit of time id wager that if youre shooting for effective turns youre probably looking at 10 hours on normal as youre learning the game  those hours are spent idyllically i believe the youngsters would say something like hard chillin the tension comes from wanting to do more but not being able to  i suppose the domains are also elements that ratchet up tension but even on my first play with no preexisting knowledge i found them all trivial until the very end of the game

then the end game has a word and that word elaborates on its intentions the word is not pg13 its carnal no not like clowns i lost my first run badly or maybe i didnt i got an achievement for surviving the apocalypse even thou i finished with 0 pipsif intended thats a confusing interaction becauseyes i the elder made it  i was skipping to my loo for hours upon hours recalling the warning during difficulty selection then i was shown 

speaking of domains theyre everything theyre really all that a player should focus on period the results are nonsensical sometimes win every domain check you win the game

im an extremely avid board game fan this game is certainly influenced by worker placement mechanics thats being said it doesnt evoke it as well as most modern cardboard games do this is worker placement if i have however many workers i want i believe the dev intends to limit this in a future patch so now my only real calculus about workers is do i have enough food doesnt seem like its ever going to be a struggle to include during winter unless youre talking the final page

okay so i typed quite a bit about this games flaws now lets talk about what i enjoyed about it

its peaceful its truly chill in that way that only vsai turnbased can be time too cook i go cook i come back and dotage is right there waiting for me the various tech trees are for my initial impressions quite deep while simultaneously samey ive yet to attempt a second run yet so id be interested in seeing how their availability changes yet another ats strength 

tldr  i prefer against the storm but am happy to own this the former is more stressful but takes 30m25hrs a run this takes 10 hrs and probably overstays its welcome each run this game is peacefuluntil the end when it absolutely murders you your family and your cat awesome achievement developed by a single person final product being a tiny list of collaborators

#####

usually these kind of games are eighter unbalanced or lack strategic depth
but since they provided a demo and it kinda worked okish i took a gamble and bought it

no regrets played for 10 hours straight very strategically in depth big skill tree5 tabs with 35 choices in each layer so a choice between 1020 at any given time even earlygame 
multiple things threaten your village and a lot of buildings require turns to build and train someone which really tests your strategic skill to get the infrastructure online right when you need it to start producing as a lack of a certain resource could cost you many turns that you cannot afford to lose

starts easy and self explanatory and slowly scales into big brain gaming 1010

#####

cant write a review right now its 2am have work in 6 hours just need to take a few more turns

#####

awesome colony sim game dont let the cute little pixel art fool you it can get quite complex later on and i think im far from unlocking all the tools available the fact its turnbased instead of real time makes dot age a unique experience i really like that you can plan everything at your own pace before moving to the next day and see the outcome

also you get to be an old man and yell at stuff

#####

hyper addictive resource management game once you get your engines up and running though the game goes really stale the first third of the game felt challenging and fun but the last third of the game was mostly just pressing spacebar repeatedly

#####

full of promise this game definitely occupies its own niche whilst drawing on many mechanics from other city builders and resource management games the closest might be against the storm lacking combat your job is to help your villagers succeed at life and help them to be strong enough to overcome the many prophecies of doom and woe deal with unique challenges that change your playthroughs unlock ia loti of tech with different buildings shrines and other cool fixtures giving you several strategies to thrive 

really crisp well executed pixel art lays the foundation for tactile and snappy menus the ui is good and the overall looking pleasing its rounded out by a surprisingly good soundtrack almost reminiscent of stardew valley while a little on the pricey side beauty is in the eye of the beholder and i for one find it still worth the money its got deep gameplay and a great amount of content the developer is friendly engaged and active on the project expect updates fixes and new additions 

why not give the demo a try

h1 always obey your eldersh1

some days im willing to struggle against the rng punished for every small mistake and other days i just want a chill experience i appreciate that dotage allows you to experience either thanks to its difficulty settings transforming from a clawyourwayup tale of survival into a cutesy village simulator with some hilarious and bizarre random events either way you decide to play its a great time im playing on steam deck and though theres no controller support dotage works just fine right out of the box the text is completely legible and im not having to fiddle with anything to make it less awkward to control woot 

dotage is adorable and the writing is hilarious but beneath its silly and charming exterior lurks a challenging survival game your small tribe consists of the elder who has lived through many crisis before and is trying his hand at surviving this one and the pips he commands the premise of the game is that this elder has visions of the apocalypse and with his guidance and careful attention to your growing populations resources you can prevail your pips can build gather resources and operate increasingly complex buildings the longer you survive in game the more your elder remembers and therefore more tech and random events you unlock you can also research new technology which is fairly standard to the genre i liked that this is turnbased meaning you can assign your pips to tasks at your leisure rather than feeling like youre racing against the clock to preemptively deal with a series of small fires

the needs of your village grow as your technology advances meaning your pips will no longer be satisfied with simple huts and will begin to crave leisure activities plus youll need to specialize their jobs in order to create more complex items like cooked food and tools the steady flow of upgrading from a ragtag group of buildings and foraging for food to a bustling selfsufficient metropolis is very satisfying 

food and building materials are your main resources to worry about though depending on the domain threat which corresponds with the apocalyptic events that play our during the course of your run youll also have to contend with creating heat hope and nature you get plenty of warning ahead of doom events and can even change the outcome of some of them by having your pips produce resources to combat them for example if a cold event is going to savage your town you would create heat this removes some of the rng reliance but that isnt to say youre guaranteed a good outcome sometimes the game will throw a wrench in your plans by escalating the threat level meaning the negative resources will build up much more quickly if your buildings arent up to snuff in terms of production you can easily be overrun and get a negative outcome 

things canand willgo wrong buildings will catch fire pips will get sick and the seasons will be unkind particularly winter where you can no longer farm and hunted animals no longer replenish but it never feels unfair or like you dont have a way to at least bounce back from a tragedy this is the sort of game where youll say ill just finish up research for this tech and then ill head to bed and then look up and realize its 3amand i mean that in the best of ways if youre looking for a simulationstrategy game with roguelike elements dotage is well worth the asking price support this solo dev


#####

it is really very good simple to understand yet with a good amount of depth 

dotage is a worker placement game where you build your village from the ground up collecting resources to expand and fend off various terrible events there are a good number of production chains for you to explore and a variety of difficulty levels making the game accessible to everyone the game comes with an in game encyclopedia with an amusing name to help you get by as well as hints basically mini tutorial screens to remind you how things work 

a lot of thought needs to go into building your village buildings need other building types nearby and can gain production bonuses from placement as well both from buildings and even the type of terrain nearbybuilt on maps are randomised so no 2 villages will look the same the graphics are really well done as well your pips are full of character and the change of seasons are very well done pips speak in a sort of simlish style which i love music is similarly strong and fits the games theme well

of course growing your village isnt your only goal you have terrible events to fight for those who do not like rng do not fear  all major events are clearly marked out in advance so you can prepare for them you fight events by resource collection on harder difficulties you will need to make tough decisions about what your pips produce if you do not have enough workers to meet demand

the game has a lot of content a sizeable tech tree and plenty of unlocks to get more content you will get your worth out of dotage

there is not a lot wrong with dotage and the single dev has been hard at work from launch to fix any major bugs although i will confess i have not run into any issues what i will say is that although the game describes itself as a rougelike it leans heavily on the like part that isnt a criticism at all  but do not expect quick runs runs will last a long time if want to complete them i am 5 hours deep into a run and only halfway through fortunately new stuff you unlock is immediately available within your current run so you wont miss out on stuff

a quick word advice on difficulty  the game currently warns you that normal difficulty is pretty tough if you have played worker placement style games before i would recommend trying the next difficulty up its less time consuming to fail and scale down rather breeze through and realise you have another 5 hours to go before you win

all in all dotage is well worth your time and a credit to the solo dev who made this happen i truly hope that you sold more than you expected from this wonderful game

#####

its a neat little game  takes the build x next to y and gain z genre and makes it turned based which has advantages and disadvantages  i would agree with other reviews that say the game at first feels a bit too much like a spreadsheet simulator and this is from a guy who likes a good spreadsheet simulator and i think a lot of that comes from the turned based aspect of the game combined with the mechanics being toopredictable  however you unlock new mechanics and new types of random events the more you play and this adds elements of uncertainty that makes planning more complicated and more interesting

the game just feelslong though  a lot of whether im doing well or poorly seems to come down to making sure i remember to do all the stupid little things i need to do each turn rather than coming up with a really interesting or clever strategy and that is more anxiety inducing then it is fun  my listed 94 hours playtime is a little misleading because i often just leave games on in the background but i probably have over 40 hours and im still only a little past 23rds of the way through my first playthrough  apparently the maps are randomly generated the tech randomizes and some of your unlocked features show up only when you do a new playthrough i have no idea though cause im still working on my first  all of the randomized starting elements and small map make it really feel like a game designed for much much shorrter playthroughs  its like if slay the spire took 60 hours to do a run sht gets exhausting especially considering this is a one save permadeath game

#####

ive played a lot of simulation games that range from rtsstyle to turnbased to grand strategy and old classics like actraiser and early tycoon games and i love strategy games like anything tactics so this game was a great find to me

realtime strategy rts style simulations like factorio and satisfactory are fun purely in the mania of it all but the problem stems from a threats not being threatening enough or b youre a factory wizard but now its time to megamind everything but theres no opposition so it feels empty

or turnbased strategy games where poor choiceschoices made without existing knowledge of the entire game that punishes you the entire way for not already knowing the game means the developers failed to teach you how to play
this game isnt like either ive only completed one playthrough at writing this review but this game has a great new game feature with full mechanic shifts so buildings and redrawing plans feels good

dotage focuses more on individuality of your villagers in a way thats both thorough enough to get a warm and fuzzy for your pips but not overly in depth like maybe rimworld or dwarf fortress where it becomes a nuisance that you have so much control over each individual character

910

#####

heres the rub its a neat game solid premise and pretty easy to understand its got good art direction it mostly makes sense and hell its got a demo

but its also pretty slow mostly on account of having little animations to go through between turns  even when sped up its also extremely easy to the point of it getting boring  and completing a run is like 68 hours mostly because of the animations early on its rough the challenge being to produce enough numbers to satisfy a challenge quota but you can beat every single bit of difficulty in this just by having more people the penalty for having people is needing housespace and food but the maps are huge so housing is kind of irrelevant and it turns out having more people also solves food too bizarrely the end game techs all resolve around using fancy people to use less people with their own requirements but you can just put down two of whatever lesser building instead and be just fine its not entirely an issue of the chosen difficulty either as i was besting challenges by margins of hundreds of points and the difficulty doesnt scale that far thats ignoring that winning the challenge quotas also gets you boons and lets you snowball

in my first game i havent been under any threat about forty minutes into a seven hour run it isnt a particularly compelling game for something that paints itself as a challenging builder still cute tho

#####

dotage is an instant clasic 
its fun when you win
its fun when you lose

favourite features
 dyslexia font
 silly events
 inheritence of characteristics from parents to the child this includes gender
 drawbacks of some more advanced buildings eg speed vs resource efficiency
 many layers of randomization

would love to see
 a way to see the parents of a pip





#####

like stacklands but more tactical and challenging

#####

i would describe dotage as a tactical turnbased city builder with deckbuilder and boardgame elements its extremely well crafted exudes charm and provides all the information you need to plan our decisions this is a must have if you enjoy city builders or deck builders

note on current playtime i played and loved the demo during the steam event it was featured in and you can expect to see my playtime grow significantly 

#####

been playing civilization games my whole life this is my new favorite

#####

dotage is great its approachable but challenging keeping me coming back to try again no matter how many times my village succumbs to the whims of the deities if you like against the storm or stacklands you will probably like dotage

#####

thought the game looked a bit odd didnt notice it till i seen it on the steam front page advertised with a discount watched a youtube video checked it out decided to give it a shot first time playing the game and i noticed i unlocked the play for 5 hours achievement 

has it been 5 hours already just buy this game its worth the full not discounted price gonna throw it on my steam deck and take this new addiction i mean game with me to work

one of the only main things i can really think of what i dislike if i had to add anything is giving buildings that are the same a bit more variety in their appearance the basic homes all look the same and are the same color i understand that helps identify them but a bit of variety goes a long way

i hope the developer continues to add new content id even pay for a dlc with new events buildings scenarios ect

#####

overall i really like the gameit has a fun gameplay loop and very inventive way of handling a civilizationcolony type game in a new way

the only thing im not a huge fan of is how long the games go on it feels excessively long especially when you consider that if you fail you have to start all over again my longest run was about 8 hours and i got maybe 13 of the way through the prophecy before something catastrophic happened and i had to start over i dont mind games where failure means starting over i have like 300 hours in spelunky alone but it does feel discouraging in dotage to start again after sinking an entire workday of time into something only to have it ruined after one failed event itd be nice if there was an option to set a game length at the beginning and choose to have a shorter run or a longer one although im guessing thered have to be a lot of rebalancing of numbers and events to accommodate this i understand i can change the difficulty level to something easier but i dont want to change the difficulty level i like the normal difficulty leveli just want a shorter run time over all

#####

i never would have thought a turnbased resource management game would keep me up until sunrise but here it is

im not even really sure what other game i can compare this to which is impressive in its own right

its a well made well thoughtout game and i dig it

#####

took about 30 minutes of playing to really get into it  then i was hooked

#####

this game is just amazing in so many ways the art style is so pleasant even the burning villagers make you smile the music is actually really good it stands out enough to be memorable but isnt obnoxious the game play feels really balanced with each turn feeling like they matter whilst also spurring you on to the next this game is not as unforgiving as it states in normal difficulty i failed the first three events and managed to pick back up and pass continuously afterwards oh and theres a lot to unlock an amazing amount of depth to such a simple little game and yet some how its not overwhelming

really brilliant 1010

#####

as a fan of city builders and rougelikes this is addicting i prefer it over civ its less confusing i recommend starting on the easier mode to get used to the mechanics its not hard to grasp if you take time to plan your turns im glad there arent any guides up so i could make discoveries on my own

second play through ive spent 6 hours and made into summer 2nd year i think ill make it to the end without trouble as the resources just keep piling in spent too much time planning fingers crossed i didnt just jinx myself

love watching the village grow and the cranky elder run around

edit after completing first game
i overdid myself mid gameish it became very easy hoarded way too many resources that when the apocalypse hit i had nothing to do so i went for making babies and unlocking achievements guess its time for normal or hard mode 

overall i definitely recommend it main issue i had was some of the status effects werent explained properly but didnt affect overall game play

tips
 the animal in pens regenerate
 when you unlock a new animal it may not appear on your map events will spawn them though the animal pen might not unlock until next round so you cant capture them
 breads nice

#####

i wanted to finish a story first before writing my review although since day 1 i already highly enjoyed and already recommended the game to my friend

this games concept is one i hadnt seen yet a roguelite citybuilder with a story and and interesting mechanic that makes this game incredibly challenging but fun at the same time thanks to the domains failing my ruins honestly didnt turn me down from the game but instead made me eager to restart as with unlocking memories more and more gets added to a new run with a lot of the unlocks being randomly chosen when you start anew it made every run i started unique and interesting

i got sick and needed a chill game that didnt ask me to use my body more than i should and this game fit the game so nicely the game is turnbased so you can take your time and look at everything before ending the turn

the games visuals are also really charming

the only gripe i have with this game is that i wished i could assign which pip gets to do what or gets a treatment i figured out that the nearest pips always get chosen which made me able to at least influence which one of them i can assign to a job or have learn a proficiency however pips with ailments cant be put anywhere unless you got that one specific boon for sick ones and this has led me to some frustration at the end of the story where it really mattered which pips i wanted to help first

that being said i highly recommend this game

#####

dotage is outstanding  its a roguelite city builder not something ive seen before  well more accurately a villagebuilder the playfield isnt huge  

the central conceit is that your character is elderly with minor powers of prophecy and you have led some of your people to a new homestead  there are two main problems your dotards memory is poor so hes forgotten most of how to make a village and the apocalypse is coming   no pressure 

the economy is intricately balanced youre constantly pulling against one or more limitations  its a very impressive example of good game design you can tell the author worked on it for ages  you can never do everything you want something is always limiting you so youre balancing between fixing bottlenecks generating food and construction resources generating new labor by creating children and creating resources to fight off bad events 

as you progress your elder will warn you about incoming events he never knows what they are but he knows their type at least heat cold fear and disease there may be more  your village needs to create resources of the opposite type to try to turn the event from bad to good the more your total of good resources exceeds the gamegenerated total of bad resources the better your chance of success  good events give you minor advantages bad events give you problems   

once a season or so a doom comes upon you which is much stronger fight that off and youll get a village boon which is a powerful permanent buff at least to the current village i dont think it applies to later ones   so far i havent failed at a doom so i dont know what kind of debuff you get if you blow it  

and finally after maybe twentyish seasons you come to the apocalypse  i have no idea how that works i havent gotten that far yet  i may update this review later with more info if i think its important but i doubt itll change my opinion 

at 66 hours i am thoroughly hooked  dotage is a prime example of the one more turn genre  it is hard to put this thing down even though its turnbased and you can quit and save at any time   

i havent been this gamelocked in quite a long time  this thing is well worth full price  


#####

dotage is pretty good and has a lot of potential but is very punishing and can be challenging 

on one of my most recent runs i didnt fail a single challenge until right near the end
i felt i was doing fantastically and was enjoying the challenge of maintaining my successful run then i got unfortunately poor luck on a 76 chance of success roll even after fighting crippling sicknesses tooth and nail for an extended period of time 
all 51 of my pips instantly went to the shadow realm with no recourse needless to say i am a little sore about that run it feels too punishing at times and can feel poorly balanced with a single failed event

i dont have a problem with challenge and have enjoyed it at times but my biggest complaint is that there is frequently no recovery from failure which makes losing off of a high chance of success feel that much worse 

with all of that said the game is interesting and well fleshed out and has strong resource management mechanics the unlock mechanics offer replay value but can make progressing to a successful point feel a little slow or make you feel setup to fail in the beginning

i think there is a ton of potential and i have mostly enjoyed my time playing but i dont feel i can recommend dotage given some of the painful experiences ive had

#####

great game i gotta say that upfront kinda reminds me of a less stressful rimworld because of the turn based aspect that being said if youre looking for a cozy game to play of the steam deck look elsewhere 

on pc the controller works excellently but on the steam deck i find the controls get stuck pretty often it gets stuck on a build option or one of the bars and then the a and b buttons cease to work leaving you unable to either cancel the actionclose the menu or just put down the building to free up the controls even with the lock cursor to screen option enabled the cursor often gets stuck off screen and becomes immobile unchecking that option had no effect for better or worse you have to force close the game and restart directly from the steam deck because you cant interact with the menu i prefer to play my games on the steam deck so this is a big con in my book as much as i enjoyed the game once i started playing on pc i dont think ill end up putting many hours on this because of that very disappointed that this was verified for steam deck its the only time ive ever had an issue with something like this hopefully they fix this problem in the future 

so i recommend this game as long as youre a playing on the pc on the go gamers beware

h1very addictingh1 

when im not playing it im thinking about how i want to iplay iti

buthe gist of itub
its a random colony building game with rogueesque elements though mostly city building
if you know cid meyers civ its a bit similar in the way its generated each random map generation with different animals mountains waters wetlands and more these impact your gameplay as you expand outward

putting your barebones water source on a wetlands for example gives you lets say 1 water each day you will collect 1 water on top of the regular water uif you have it on that tileu

putting crop fields next to your water source will give you 2 crops extra etc because of the extra resources
i cant remember the exact amounts but you get it

this theme continues through the story
but thats not all

h2 its complicatedh2
and i dont mean that lightly this game has a fate system thats the roguelike part of it events are randomly generated and based on your actions very very easy to sway in my opinion the events that happen can be good or bad

a village full of anxiety and fear 
citizens that dont trust each other might lead to murder

a village that is full of hope 
they might find extra food money etc and give to the village pot

there is a lot more than this a few play throughs and ive already found a system i like the story tellers also change the game play in the way of tech trees changing sometimes per new game one time i started with the technology for a crude well another time i began with a mountain spring iplaceable only on rock tilesi

i hope this gives you an example

ps you can change the font if it bothers you like it did me i have it on currently on dyslexic

#####

perfect minimalist take on the civ genre a humongous game lurks beneath an addictingly simple facade love it

#####

a fun little game with a lot of depth its a bit slow right now in terms of waiting on rounds but i am hoping in the future there will be a skip several day function dont let that deter you from playing though its a very fun game it feels really complete and i cant wait to be able to really sit down and bite into it some more the most impressive thing about it so far is that the systems seem pretty well thought out including the domain events adding a little spice to the strategy

#####

tldr a roguelike turnbased resourcemanagement productionline settlement builder with a very very good game mechanic implementation and focus on multiple disaster risk management mitigation and recovery because of this you will always have something to strategize about and something to do also a game of discovery due to lots of content

theres meta progression where you get to unlock more resources buildings statuses effects disasters so you will have to get used to your settlement dying a number of times to unlock stuff however on normal difficulty i managed to get really far like just 2  3 years before the final apocalypse year just after two playtroughs worth of unlocks about 30 unlocked

theres also ingame unlocks ie research this may change depending on your settlements environment there are 2 factors that will affect your decisions let me explain

1 random environment to build on

each game is different you can have different terrain or starting natural resources one play could have berry bushes but another play would have strawberry fields this means you will need to research things in a different order i have heard that even your research tree might very from each game but i have yet to confirm it as i only have played 3 games total the last of which reached the year before the apocalypse

your choice of ingame progression and strategy can change depending on the kinds of disasters that will happen to your settlement which brings me to the best implemented mechanic i seen in the game


2 random timeline of events to plan for

the main focus and what i think is the game mechanic of a jewel is the disaster system each ingame season you will get a schedule of upcoming disasters you will be told what category of disaster it will be but not the effects

for example you will have a health disaster in a few days you can prevent the disaster by having settlers work on stockpiling antidisease resources vs the accumulating disease points over time if you have more than sufficient you will 100 avoid the disaster otherwise you roll the dice to see whether you avoid or suffer the disaster chance of which depending on your antidisease vs disease points

even if you suffer the setback you can still try to recover from it eg make meds to heal the people

over time the effects get worse depending on the time passed or how many times you allowedsufferedignored the disasters to happen

in the end this game also makes it fun to see how the story of your village plays out until everyone dies in the end there are numerous times where im tempted to abandon the village because its definitely gone past the point of recovery yet im morbidly fascinated at how everyone is going to die in the end

in one game i had everyone start sick then with diarrhea then sick from all the dead bodies piling up and then just give up the ghost from multiple diseases 

in another game everyone just fell down dead from some natural end of the world earthquake that destroyed every building except the cat which allowed me to continue for a good number of turns even though i got nobody to order around anymore until the cat fell sick for a number of turns and decided abandoned me


theres also a huge amount of content in this game and im really amazed how the developer managed to track them all and at least provide some decent amount of balancing because of that im pretty sure theres lots of creative outlet for trying out some way to exploit the system

#####

i love city builders and this is the most brilliant and original take ive seen in a looong while plus the dedication and love put into it are dipping from every pixel absolutely addictive but in a good way

#####

where did this game come from what happened 
it came out of nowhere and suddenly my whole sunday has passed 
jeebers
this game is most excellent

#####

while initially fun the game or a single run lasts 24 times as long as it should after 5 hours i usually have a very solid foundation and am unlikely to encounter real problems unless theyre completely unpredictable while unpredictable problems are good in some game genres they are a sign of poor design in management games so even that wouldnt really help winter is a bit troubling because its not easy to predict which food sources are disabled during it but once youve survived it your food chain is bulletproof and you should have so much surplus productive pips that theres no real challenge left

sure you can finish expanding up the tech tree although youll run out of things to research before the end of the game if youre running 23 tech buildings consistently but theres no real benefit to doing that all of the 2nd tier professions the ones that require special pips to train into them are balanced to be only marginally better than the base buildings which would be fine if they didnt require 10 hours of game play to unlock and didnt require more thought from the player to even break even in management games one of the elements that needs to be balanced is the complexity or cognitive load on a player if one building is standalone and the other building requires a three deep production chain and multiple adjacencies then the other building needs to much better than the standalone building or else theres no payoff for all the extra work the player is doing not to mention all the extra work the pips are doing to maintain the production chain

ultimately the early game is much more fun and engaging than the mid  late game in the current state of the game

#####

i literally bought this game 6 days ago and amassed 40 hours like it was nothing incredible game there is so much content and i wasnt this captivated by a game in a while 

i was impressed by how intuitive everything felt even though i never played a city builder type game before there was no building or item that felt useless which helps the immersion since you want to keep exploring and advance this was one hell of an addiction for the last 6 days i finally completed my first run which lasted like 1520 hours i believe i desperately started a new run each time i lost and won on my third
i love how you can see how much the dev is involved with the playerbase everything is so thought out i wish i played it when it was only a demo

i can only recommend it even if youve never played a city builder before
btw is there a way to see your past runs and how much hours they lasted if not then it would be a cool addition i think

#####

really good challenging game with a lot of replayability i still havent beaten it after several runs and it keeps opening up more content and changing how the playthrough goes with each new attempt i originally pirated it but have since bought in on steam as it deserves the money for being such a cool little game

#####

this game absolutely rules  its a worker placement game with legacy elements basically

#####

i came to say that this absolutely slaps on steam deck between this and against the storm i never knew that roguelite citybuilding on the can could be so wonderful i also want to say that i love that when it comes to expanding your village love is love no matter the gender or color of your pips

#####

a run takes too long and i run out of things to do research and build after about 810 hours the upside is that while playing through those 810 hours it is a gem of a game and incredibly fun just needs the end of the run to not be such a boring slog that i would rather give up my run and start over to get back to the fun bit with some new randomized elements

#####

im a 50 year old man and i love to play this game with my two sons they tell me that i remind them of the elder because i always yell at them while they do chores

#####

playing this game is like being scratched in that perfect itchy spot i have only played it for 3 hours at this point but i can already tell that this will be one of my all time favourites 

 deep city building mechanics with a huge research tree
 light and funny humour
 beautiful pixel graphics with a lot of details
 clear and powerfull ui easy on the eyes
 very cute tutorialprogression system
 thorough encyclopedia which is very well written short and to the point and highly accessible
 novel turnbased roguelike simulation mechanic

completely mind blowing that this was made by a single developer you deserve all the success 
looking forward to playing this game for many more hours

#####

a lot of fun but be warned just one more turn can easily turn into hours and hours 

#####

first off a relevant and unique pun for a title is so refreshing second i love a game that keeps you coming back to try different strategies and learn more third when you finish a turn a prophecy or even a game there are still elements left that you want to explore new memories new buildings new protagonist hero city builders just finished my first game on normal difficulty after 5 or 6 tries and had a great time dotage feels like a city builder sort of and also a card game sort of imagine unique buildings with interdependent stats and requirements as cards and maybe also a chesslike board game sort of where the pieces buildings fit together on a limited board in a myriad of rule governed ways im having a great time with it kudos to the developer also who seems to be very attentive on the discussion forums and ended up fixing a problem i reported within a few days looking forward to playing this game some more

#####

this game kept surprising me with gradually increasing ammounts of content the scale of the game is hard to understate yet its so easy to get into

#####

i dont review many games but i had to for this one as a fan of city builders management sim games and board games i couldnt be more happy with this the actual building part of the game is similar to lots of others where this game shines is in its random events system this system alone adds so much replayability and character to the game youd think as i did that the turnbased system would be a bit of a pace killer but it really isnt it makes it more of a puzzle solver which i really enjoy theres a few bugs typos and optimisation issues to iron out but this really stands out as a labour of love from the developers

#####

updated
dev take great care of improving and fixing the performance as of now i can really enjoy this great game with no issue

strikethis game is great actually 
the problem is the performance for a 2d sprite turnbased game the slog come too fast i dont know how many checks the game did in real time but you can actually see and feel your game slowing down every turn 
at turn 70 with 14 villagers on idle a la not issuing order or calculating endturn my fps was at 60 while i got rtx 3080 16 gb and r5 3600  40 utilized the game started feeling laggy to move around sometime even unresponsive at times
there is something not right
i look around the forum and see the dev response to something like working on it dont expect the same level of performance as big name game the latter one is what irritating me and compelled to write this review
there are tons of colony sims that do everything in realtime with a lot moreas perceived by player going on and run better than this this feel like losing 50 of performance in dwarffortress with only 2 dozen of dwarfstrike

#####

ill start by acknowledging that there is a lot the game does that is interesting if it was just the extremely unpolished uxui it would play as a game suited to early access or a high fidelity prototype i was generally enjoying my time with it and it doesnt have many obvious bugs

the inconsistent behavior with worker management a central part of the game is bad enough sometimes it pulls a skilled worker from another post and replaces them with an untrained worker good other times fails to do so and you must manually deal manage the swap not great but workable workers will sometimes abandon their post when resource capacity is full understandable but the game also warns you about resource capacity other times theyll wander away for no reason at all leaving an unfilled post without warning bad

that still doesnt bring it below early access expectations so what went sufficiently wrong that im immediately put off possibly for good the game has different versions of multiple buildings you can get apple or pear tree quarry that can be placed on rocks or wants to be surrounded by them id lost more than a few runs because i didnt notice which building version i had access to frustrating that the interface isnt clearer but i can put the extra effort in to be more careful

my most recent run however was a different story things are going well all four threats were well in hand with substantial safety margins ive diversified my food options to increase my stockpile capacity is per resource type then the floods come my first flood time to survey the damage

checking the condition a flooded building cant be used until the condition is removed  that makes sense

the time spent showing each affected building was a bit worrying how many buildings got hit twentynine buildings out of fiftyseven over 50 of my entire town is unusable

okay things look bad but how do i clear the condition ive been in bad spots before  quakes that left me needing to use basic resources to repair buildings or fires that can be extinguished with water a resource needed to plant crops early on looking looking

that cant be right let me double check no i was right the first time the resource i need to clear half of my town of flooding is paper i didnt have a single sheet of paper i didnt even have a paper producer yet  i hadnt needed one everything i might have needed it for had alternate means to achieve the desired outcome

hours into the run and the failure point is that i have insufficient paper

players are warned that the game is merciless when starting at even normal difficulty thats fine i dont mind a steep learning curve i can always lower the difficulty if i find myself struggling however merciless isnt the first word i would use to describe this game this games issue isnt that it doesnt forgive mistakes the issue is that it doesnt bother to tell you what a mistake is until after it happens and gives you know way to reason out or predict what you might need ahead of time the game isnt merciless

it is entirely iarbitraryi

#####

i was skeptical at first but now i can say for sure this game is the most addicting thing ive played in years honestly im embarrassed to tell you how many hours ive played this week

bgameplayb

its hard to pinpoint the exact reasons why i love this but for an rts and roguelike lover like myself it checks all the boxes in my opinion this kinda does to civ what stardew valley did to harvest moon

the domain system hooks you quickly and challenges you constantly the gameplay is ruthless but you actively learn new things every playthrough and the alternation between technologieselders makes every run fresh and truly unique  something i didnt foresee its like playing chess scrambling all the pieces but it still makes sense even when flawed and unfair  it kinda adds some extra angeradrenaline to the taste of failure

my only request would be for there to be a rush mode though  a 6hour run can be painstakingly long for people with you know day jobs and cutting it into two sessions just didnt do it for me  having to remember all my decisions and starting in the middle would ruin the most fun part 

i finished unlocking the tech tree at the exact same run i beat the game not sure it was intended but the game design and the intended experience felt solid as hell

bgraphicsb

im a big pixel art fan and the minimalism here has a lot of charisma  which is what drew my attention in the first place

having said that one thing threw me off a little bit and made me skeptical of the game as a whole the ui system its not ugly but it wasnt fully optimized some transitions felt kinda glitchy some menu options were a little too jarring some song transitions werent fully polished and all these small things got me worried the game would be more amateur than i wanted it to be luckily i was wrong the games amazing and i can tell the dev is already improving minor details like the ones that bugged me

bloreb

i dont play games like this for the lore but your initial stats being your enemy all along was a very inventive twist the memory system too though dialogues can be a little jarring and slow sometimes i played the demo a while ago and i must say im glad the superfast mode was added i can tell this wasnt the devs original wish but i was struggling to play without it sure the animation gets weirder in fast forward but we gotta accept that the audience is not here primarily for the animations in all honesty id appreciate if the transitions were even faster all respect to the lore but after a few runs all you want is to build a lot of stuff

blong story shortb

im glad i finally beat the game i would be awake til 5am for the third day in a row otherwise congrats on the work michele theres a lot of passion on this project and it shows you deserve all the success in the world and your father should be proud

#####

starts great minimalistic management game with tons of content that you slowly unlock 
i really want to stress this out first two hours or so are awesome game has nice learning curve you unlock things at an appropriate pace you feel like you can accomplish the tasks the game throws at you
but the more you advance after that the more annoying and cumbersome it gets everything is so slow even with all the options for fast night turned on it still takes like 30 seconds to progress to the new day and nothing really happens there 
the minievent system is terrible  each event is 10 seconds of retarded animations after watching a pip walk across half the map just to give you like 4 wood which is useless very annoying
everything scales but building stuff takes sooo long later like 5 turns for a building that way you dont really have time to react as events are like 57 turns you have to just spam all the shit proactively and hope you have enough because the game does not really tell you how much you will need for example i was ok with one healing house the whole game but i needed like 8 hope buildings at one point and 4 fires why no idea game just throws random numbers at you and that is if you have free space  if you dont and have to rebuild its another pain in the ass as buildings that have requirements cant be built without those requirements so that just takes even longer you have to demolish stuff in 1 turn then build one building for 2 turns then you can build another building for 3 turns and then you have to build the final one for 5 turns but at this point you dont need the resource anymore 
and as your population grows the micromanagement gets a bit too much you are constantly searching for your buildings mouseovering them to see if someone is working them and constantly redistributing your pips this needs a better way
then you have the profession system i really would like a retrain option if you train too much of something you are stuck with mostly useless pip as later there are very few jobs anyone can do
and then you get a completely new pip type the burgeoise and i just couldnt take it anymore and quit the game

#####

for the price its definitely a recommendation that being said it would be at least twice as good of a game if it took half as long to complete a playthrough having the months be over 30 days each was an odd choice but in the end it works for what it is and with such a fair price its hard to complain it also has clear vision throughout and good design choices in many parts kudos to the dev

#####

an original and delightfully presented take on turnbased city builders
as long as you love turnbased games you really cant go wrong with this game



#####

a city building survival game with randomisation on every run akin to against the storm

top notch just buy it

#####

i died to death of the universe 

game is a bit drawn out well done though plenty of bugs but they were mostly audiovisual stuff

would like to have a little more direct control with micro though game does a reasonable job of choosing for you

definitely needs better summary tabs and access to info that is going on in a list format for creatures pips buildings threatsthreat contributors however game does a surprisingly well job without allowing you to see it easilyintuitively would like to resourcesthreats running at a loss more clearly as the list becomes unmanageable late game once you get hit with a negative omen etc

#####

the amount of content in the first versions of the game can be overwhelming but is satisfying to figure out and perfect for roguelite gamers that enjoy longer runs 

if youre looking for
 replayability 
 great humor
 being challenged
 supporting a diligent dev 

then this is your game

#####

super fun game i love playing it

but the number one reason why id recommend it is because the devs appear to really care ive seen them in multiple places asking about players experiences they want to make the game enjoyable so it seems like theyre trying to listen to the players

#####

overview dotage is a colony and resource management game about planning for unforeseen consequences that you kind of know about youre fighting the typical colony tropes starvation winter etc but youre also fighting against random events that you are given advance notice of if you played frostpunk remember how frostpunk would warn you when a temperature drop was a couple days away dotage uses a very similar mechanic but theres different categories of events and each category relies on building separate types of buildings and producing separate types of resources to stave off that disaster the degree to which you commit your resources to these categories influences the severity of the resulting event its a simple idea but with a lot of depth and strategy to it

youll like it if you enjoy elements of planning ahead in resource management games maximizing tile bonuses and especially population management and worker allocation knowing how many villagers you need ten turns from now to run your economy and working towards it well in advance of when its going to be a problem is your saving grace here theres some randomness in the buildings that youre offered every run and the resources available on your map so its difficult to reduce the game down to a prescribed optimal build order you have to think on your feet and work with what you are given for a particular run

you will not like it if you feel that rng spoils your carefullylaid plans the game wants you to fail the game is trying to get you to fail it will tell you what you need to do to try and stave off disaster but thats about it if you spent your first season constructing a village designed to survive the worst fear and heat disasters of the spring and you get mad that your first summer omen is in the sickness domain which you didnt plan for at all you may experience some frustration with this game if you look at dwarf fortress or rimworld and you say to yourself actually losing is not fun this is probably not the one for you

#####

fun and cute city builder i think its one of the few ones to do a really interesting spin on player vs environment where most the ones i would enjoy like rimworld have a heavy focus on military and combat this is one of those banished type games that has so much variety of threat ways to deal with it and the prophecy system makes it enjoyable to tackle each doom even

you have a prophetic scroll that lays out the next set of events changes in the season and warns you of upcoming doom which are the big events that mark the end of a scrolls page beating the doom event gives you a powerful boon but you can survive the consequences of it and hope to do better next event provided the event didnt annihilate your entire settlement eventually youll foresee the apocalypse which is a scroll page that presumably marks a cascade of doom its the greatest challenge to your village and ive yet to actually make it to the apocalypse because this game even on normal difficulty will challenge you not so much that youll find yourself doing villager micro every single turn so it finds a good balance between a casual yet challenging playstyle and there are harder difficulties for the daring

every success and to a lesser extent failure in a run will reward you with little puzzle pieces that let you unlock more stuff for future runs broadening your options when growing your city and dealing with doom so there is a rogue lite element where a loss isnt a waste of time say for example you do really well beat every doom event but then get an incredibly impossible sequence of events that just grind you into the ground you will still get a large progression reward for beating every other event as you are also rewarded puzzle pieces based on your score

overall a really fun city builder ive played it for 15 hours and still havent unlocked close to half the available content and every run feels different

#####

this game is one of the most fantastic games that isnt my jam everything about it is welloiled and interesting but i personally just dont vibe with certain things like the rng determining which researchwater extractionworkshop techs you have to work with would easily recommend to anyone that doesnt mind randomness in their setups on these sorts of things just doesnt personally butter my bread

#####

i witnessed a mass killing shortly after a mass starvation leaving me only with 2 pips one pip killed the other pip leaving me with only 1 pip my last surviving pip got sick and wandered off into the wilderness never to be seen again 

1010 wanting to get doomed again

#####

this is an absurdly fun game tough as nails but always rewarding the fact that its played in turns makes it the perfect second monitor game ill be playing this for years

#####

great idea but i dont think its fun the memory unlock process makes the game really tedious for no reason locking you out of tech and resources until you lose enough times

#####

insanely addicting it ends up being just one more turn for 50 turns it has some awesome replayability and beating it the first time was sooo satisfying highly recommended

#####

after 13 straight waking hours im incredibly impressed by this game seeing screenshots of the game gave me no sense for how it really plays but i dont really know another game like it even describing its mechanicstheme doesnt really do it justice  its a turnbased workerplacement roguelike villagebuilder the phrase turnbased probably turns a lot of people off but it shouldnt at least in this case   it just works so well admittedly my thoughts on it were something like first 3 minutes im not sure about this next 15 minutes no this is actually good  next 1530 minutes or is it  and then after that no this is amazing   its very puzzly at least in normal mode placement of buildings is crucial and the game punishes poor decisions it tells you normal mode is merciless and it is but even though there were random events every time i got punished i pointed to multiple things i got wrong    it is roguelike than  against the storm which i love because  more like rogue the scenarios arent short and you start over  when you lose not just because you successfully succeed a scenario   its also a great story builder in my mind at least as good if not better than rimworld you get real interactions between the characters and you feel the story of the village developing you feel it turn as things start to go bad   the simple graphics might turn people off but theyre quite good hey i never thought dwarf fortress needed graphics so you can take my word there with a grain of salt 

the gameplay loop is tight and engaging constantly making tough decisions when you do well you feel like the rewards are great sometimes you have a tough time deciding which reward to take and sometimes the decision is easy based on your situation the game rewards good planning and the roguelike nature means you can and are expected to take what you learned and help it move you further in the next iteration

#####

unique and mechanically robust gives that one more turn feeling as you chase the perfect layout balance your resources and plan for impending disasters 

i like how everything is concretely presented even the exact odds of negative events so you can make more informed strategic decisions at first this makes the game appear simple but as you progress you find theres a lot more to balance not only resources but finding the best arrangement of buildings for adjacency bonuses with limited space and deciding when to ramp up population versus food versus disaster prevention

#####

excellent supply chain management game with disasters thrown in plays something like a turn based anno game with charming pixel graphics highly recommended to anyone who enjoys the supply chain town builder genre

#####

its so stressful but brilliantly fine tuned really good puzzler and im enjoying my brain being melted

#####

this is a tremendous effort by a solo dev  a truly unique colony sim in a sea of copycats  feels almost like a turnbased rimworld  think the structure of a civalization game  carefully chose what you want to happen on a turn via lots of microdecisions then lock them in and see how they turn out  theres also a very clever prophecy system that allows you to prepare for upcoming hardships  im really enjoying what ive played so far  bravo

#####

doesnt look like much but it has a nice crunchy worker placement puzzle

#####

i stayed up til 6 am playing this its utterly addicting when the game is going well

little tip if the game is going badly dont give up you still get memory points by failing events

#####

today is the first time i have played dot age i now have 104 hours in dot age and i plan to have even more tomorrow 

know how youve been wanting to build a town that you have some control over but not like super micromanagey with a charming pixel aesthetic a reasonable tech tree with like a little storytelling sprinkled in 

and like a bunch of games almost nail it but theyre just not quite scratchin that itch yeah this is the one youre lookin for

#####

love the turn based style and the animations are awesome

#####

this game is too good like seriously

add this to the list of masterpieces i have to write a review for

#####

this game is the definition of one more turn theres a lot more demo suggests

#####

been a while since i saw such a masterpiece of a videogame
and who doesnt love an elder screaming  maaah toaster

and jokes aside that game gets you hooked just the next turn and than you still play it the next 4 hours





#####

delightful cross between rimworld and the settlers 2 clearly made with a lot of passion and care highly recommended for fans of either types of game

#####

really fun strategy game about managing resources and preparing for disaster feels really good to beat the odds and succeed bad events can be devastating if you dont stay on top of things and let it all spiral out of control
you have to think ahead and every single turn matters work those pips do not waste their potential its very rare that complete randomness can completely screw things up at least from my experience you just have to be prepared
discovering new aspects of the game that increase its complexity over time is awesome and does a good job of onboarding new players and keeping things fresh for the long game
if you like this kind of game i couldnt recommend it more

#####

having an amazing time ive been looking for a game like that for a long time it is very obvious that the dev care for the player experience theres a lot of details that makes the experience so much more pleasant the games color palette is exquisite i love all the seasons its just so pretty also turn based i can take all my time making it very accessible for me the game is very fun

#####

a really charming and addictive boardgamelike basebuilder youre slowly expanding your village by allocating workforce towards specific resources while trying to fend off various seasonal or rng requirements like for example providing enough cooling during summer or health to fend off sickness the resources feel meaningful and scarce youre always working towards something and it just keeps you pushing towards the next goal to improve the village which makes for a very compelling gameplay loop

i dont know how well will it scale in the late game or if its going to stay as fun since i dont have that many hours in it yet but today i wanted to just give it a quick try and ended up playing for multiple hours due to the good old one more turn lie with which the game tempts you all the time the game is easy to play and feels very polished i havent run into any issues or bugs so far and pretty much everything has been intuitive enough to figure out without struggling 

what i can say for sure is that it definitely feels like a big labor of love the game itself oozes charm and soul from the little pips hopping around your village to the ui and sounds and i can see myself spending a lot of time on it if it stays interesting with some new mechanics or challenges like maybe more complicated production chains in the later stages of the game its definitely a recommendation from me but if youre still on the fence  just try out the demo it is well made and a good representation of the game

#####

dotage is a surprisingly deep and replayable experience the solo developer is active and monitors discord discussions daily if you are interested at all  you should definitely pick it up

#####

basically you cant fck up a single event or the negative events snowballs horribly at one point you have like 50 negative points per turn and you can only generate 2 positive points to fight back and by then the game becomes a stupid waiting to die game it doesnt even scale to villagers amount you have have only 1 villager because all died and your village will still generate like 200 of the bad points

#####

i love turned based games i love colony sims i love board games but i just dont love this game i cant quite put my finger on it but it doesnt give me the desire to come back and play it it could be the combination of a colony sim and turned based game that i dont like i will give it a few more hours to see if i change my mind plus ive got to get my money worth i already passed the 2 hours so i cant refund it

#####

fantastic game  anyone who says otherwise is a coward

#####

this game is phenomenal 

if turnbased worker placement village builder sounds at all interesting to you stop reading buy this if it doesnt then keep reading because it should dont miss out on this lovingly crafted gem

#####

having run ending events happen because you didnt minmax your run isnt very fun game design in my opinion if there was a middle of the road option for recommendations thatd be what im sitting at the game plays fun and engaging it rewards foresight but it punishes any sort of unpreparedness exceedingly harshly in what comes down to a dice roll 

my first run ended in my first autumn figured that id learned my lesson started a second with what i screwed up the first time in mind my second is ending in my second summer because i lost a 6050 rng roll to sickness and the entire map became infertile all of my food sources are gone aside from fish which there arent enough of to support my population

on one hand im enjoying it its fun you get a better idea of whats expected from you each time you push further but on the other hand i feel cheated due to bullshit my other facilities to deal with the three other domains in my world are sitting in fine spots and i should be able to take on threat 67 sickness fine now but one lapse in strategy was enough to flush my run down the shitter

#####

the game really wants you to know about endgame layouts on turn 1 its also full of feedback loops

youre building a village and the main challenge is the periodic supernatural events in 5 categories heat cold disease fear and nature to win an event you have to generate enough of the matching special resource cold heat health hope and nature theres a feedback loop where if you win an event its easier to win future events and if you lose an event you get a penalty that makes it likely youll lose future events

to win the endgame events requires very efficient production of health etc which in turn requires specific layouts in particular you have to surround some buildings with houses which means you need to build houses with this restriction in mind before you know the endgame buildings exist some of the buildings have requirements centered around social buildings but its the same idea

part of the problem here is that the map is quite small and its difficult to fit all the buildings you need on the map theres also an overly restrictive penalty for high population and you really need more people than the softcap of 59 to fill the wide variety of jobs you need

you can tear down buildings in order to rearrange your village but generally you cant afford the time to do so which means you end up with a lot of situations where you effectively lost the game 200 turns ago when you made some building placement decision




#####

incredibly fun yet frustrating game as you build your village to counter the ongoing threats from the domains each attempt teaches you something you need to be aware of for the next time but the randomness of which techs you have access to makes it interesting kudos to those able to play on normal or higher difficulties im happy struggling with my wee village on relax and even if it is easy mode the game can screw you over shakes fist at pip that just stole 120 food in the dead of winter

#####

edit missed the dev reach out sorry about that but updates have nailed the ones i was running into with some placement uncertaintywonkiness and the general improvements overall have changed this into a recommend from me cheers to the dev original review below for context

there is a fantastic game here that i cant wait to recommend once they resolve numerous placement and action bugs that range from being mildly annoyingfixable with saving and loading to being complete run enders i cannot recommend this game with the current state of bugs

#####

i dont like the ui and the gameplay is kind of boring

#####

while i do enjoy a ton of the mechanics and the level of difficulty on the second easiest if you do one or two turns wrong the game will punish you for it i really want to like this game and its quirks but when you have spent 10 hours building a village just to watch it get decimated at the drop of a hat it makes it really hard for me to 
if you want to play a minmax cute city builder this is for you if you want a relaxing game that doesnt get bogged down at end game avoid the heartache that is this game 

#####

i dunno pips may as well be actual pips for all the humanity they have to them amorphous genderless occasionally reproduce by parthenogenesis guy can live in a hut in one corner of the map and work in the opposite corner and he it wont care dont feel like colony management and definitely doesnt feel like rimworld as some commenters claim for some inexplicable reason feels more like a logistics puzzle game but the logistics themselves are really boring on account of having no physicality to them stuff just teleports around actually what it feels the most like is balancing a spreadsheet

#####

its seems easy at first but it throws twists at you all the time i threw so many hours in it try to just beat normal overall very fun brain game

#####

a bit of a puzzle a bit of a city builder really great title  a true gem

#####

the great thing about roguelikeslites is that you play the same challenging game over and over again in quick successions with each being slightly different than the last until you finally finally beat the game with a great sense of accomplishment this game is receiving a ton of love and for good reason but my personal experience was a fairly boring grind that was over in two loooong attempts it is very clear that this game has a good hook and a great addictive foundationthe problem is that it just isnt very hard or that much fun the game warns you from the onset that it has a brutal difficulty so i played on the vanilla setting thinking i was playing something along the lines of frostpunk sure enough i did die in fairly short order but then on my second attempt i breezed through the game without much difficulty other than nearly killing myself a couple of times accidentally creating heat or cold when i thought it was the domains doing it  shame there isnt a warning once you understand the mechanics its fairly easy to be hundreds of points ahead of any dangerous outcomes also the game warns you not to populate your town with too many pips at around 80 but i felt this was perhaps for poor game balancing purposes or maybe graphical performance more than anything i grew my village to 120 and the more i had the more i was able to accomplish  it just took longer to complete every turn i think i was at 30 hours total gameplay when i finished i might consider playing this game again in a years time after some finessing but for now i cant say that i recommend it having said that i actually still think you should buy it and play at a harder difficulty setting it is my hope this negative review will have an impact with the developer to hopefully make some changes and dont worry its a blip on the radar against your overwhelmingly positive review score congrats on the successful release  i look forward to trying it again someday

#####

this game is hard and confusing perhaps i should not have clicked the hard button but well see how long my subbornness holds out 

btw on steam deck theres a couple of minor ui issues mostly w how the game sometimes decides im on mouse and keyboard for some reason and i need to use the touchscreen for a single prompt before it goes back but overall no major problems would like to see a lil polish on the controller controls but thats my main complaint

#####

expected funne pixel city builder

got darkest dungeon instead

dont buy it if youre not a fan of random dice rolls that result in a game over and delete hours of progress

#####

very fun silly and stressful so many things to take care of i love it

#####

love city builders love rogue likes love turn based  this hits all of them  developer is killing it as well with updates and communication  buy it now

#####

very good game  lovely design and visuals it has some small flaws but overall its a wonderful game solid 8510

#####

pretty fun it was quite a curve  heavy tutorial but its fun when you learn all the mechnismsgameplay



the end is pretty laggy lol

#####

this is a great game in a small niche which i can wholeheartedly recommend i came to love roguelike city builders with against the storm  this game plays very differently but for me hits the same vein of as far as i can say right now making sure you have difficulties to face the whole time you play a single savevillage but also giving an actual reason to start a new one
i really appreciate the accessibility options different fonts the ability to disable flashes and shakes and there are several difficulty options to choose from with the medium offering a decent challenge
there seems to be some metaprogression as elder memories but these could also be only for a single game they seem to unlock whole new mechanics which i appreciate it makes starting the game easier on the one hand because its less overwhelming but because they unlock during gameplay and not only after finishing a game im hopeful i can actually beat a game without grinding out 10 failure runs

more when i have more playtime so far support the dev buy it now or full price its really good

#####

i love this game

#####

a highly engagingly blend of ftl civ and agricola

#####

im sorry i dont get it i have been playing the tutorial for 9 hours the ui is garbage nothing in the whatever clever name they have for an encyclopedia is hyperlinked and nothing is explained well my pips are burning from an event that required about 5 people working a pond simultaneously

it says click on them for more information on burning nothing to click on

only 38 of the people have finished the fifth prophecy reviews are a joke at this point

the game is worth about 5 dollars at best if you enjoy a tiresome puzzle losing honestly should be more abrupt i dont want to sit there waiting for the 45 citizens it lit on fire to die and i frankly dont want to bother trying to come back from that at this point start over already

#####

insanely addicting it really puts you into a just one more turn spiral and then its 3 am

great game

#####

an entertaining city builder with interesting roguelike mechanics to keep you addicted

#####

a 9year passion project  and it shows
since being introduced to the roguelite genre a while back ive always wanted a colonysim citybuilder andor resource managment roguelite game and dotage definitely hits the nail on the head im happy to say this seem to be an emerging subgenre right now and hopefully this little gem inspires other developers to make their own roguelite city builders

if you get easily put off by unforgiving mechanics id start the first couple of runs on the 2nd or 1st difficulty setting but if youre ok with messing upbecause youve not grasped the game mechanics yet and starting over normal is a very nice learning experience it can seem a bit overwhelming at first with the feeling of getting bombarded with prophecies and events but be patient and youll get the hang of it

 first run ended up with my whole village of 5 pips running for the woods leaving only the elder game over
 second run ended with 4 of my 8 pips freezing solidwhile still eating food lol and 3 others getting sick game over
 third still going strong in the 4th prophecy ageor what its called with 14 pips and all current threats in the green

take your time and study the tapestry like your life depend on it

#####

the gameplay and mechanics is quite unique and i am having fun with it i love its turnbased and before the event come you will have a vague notice about what it is so i can plan ahead in a limited turns this really makes me feel the game is fair and balanced 
the description is not really clear in some places but if you spend some time reading you can somewhat find what you want in the wiki in game
can really feel the dev love the game they are making thank you

#####

far from completing this but after 10 hours with the game i wanna give it a strong recommend its an awesome city builder survival game with really cool dynamic systems within runs and metaprogression between runs it scratches a similar but less obscene itch to oxygen not included with apocalyptic hazards that the player has to constantly mitigate while figuring out how to progress through tech trees and keep everyone alive and safe very fun very immediately addictive i could see having some nitpicky issues with balancing or systems in the long run but this was well worth the purchase

#####

fun game that builds on established mechanics worker placement village builder but has a lot of new spins and twists to offer great sense of humour great pixel art and i like the music
especially noteworthy very nice tutorial and quite a lot of content alread for early access

#####

as someone that makes small games as a hobby i really appreciate the level of polish that went into this game there are so many systems working together and still it feels like a cohesive experience and a fun and challenging one at that that also goes for the graphics and sounds well played

#####

very awesome city builder turnbased idea is neat it seems to have hooked me

i have an issue though with the roguelite aspect one succesful playthrough took me 10h28m this game does not respect your time its a coin flip if this is worth your time

it left me with a sense of succes and enjoyment but the second half of my 10h story just didnt have much memorable moments 

i look back on it fondly albeit i feel i spend too much time

#####

fun little turn based city builder it really gets that just one more turn feeling

#####

fantastic game

#####

new review after finally beating the game

its a decent resource management game that is ridiculously difficult until you permanently unlock critical tech by playing through events in an early play through 14 of my villagers were frozen and the tech required to unfreeze them was locked behind five more hours of play meanwhile theres no way to kick them out of the village they continue to consume food and they dont even thaw out in the summer

because of time locked critical tech like the above id recommend playing through on relaxed mode at least until youve unlocked half of the memories otherwise playing on normal is anything but normal but more like impossible

theres also a memory leak or something that happens after some time my 50 person village climbed from 700 mb to 1000 mb of ram while the water animations became jerky if you ever notice this its not the size of your village necessarily just restart the game and all is well for another hour or so

original review

each play through is way too long to be a rogue like part of the fun of rogue like games is that you die often but restarting isnt that painful in this game youll sink hours into a play through just to get your entire run ruined by rng 80 chance of surviving a doom event too bad rng says you lose now your entire village is on fire dont even bother trying to recover because youll just get slammed by failed event after failed event now

#####

dotage is a very fun game that allows massive strategists to thrive the only other management game that i have played in the past is a game called outlanders in the ios store its a very simple management game where like dotage you are meant to loose in order to learn how the game works if your looking for a laid back game that will challenge your brain at the same time this is your game

#####

my favorite game about doom

#####

i play this on my steam deck what a game it drip feeds you mechanics which keeps it fresh for people with short attention spans like me

#####

first off i have to preface this by saying that im usually not a fan of this type of game managing countless little numbers and having to plan a hundred turns ahead is usually stressful and unfun for me so i went into the game with middling expectations having played a bit of the demo what got me hooked was that the game is turnbased with each character in your village able to do one thing per turn so i could spend hours poring over each resource trying to squeeze just enough production out of my pips to succeed and i do mean hours

i cannot overstate how enthralling this game was to me i blinked and suddenly it was 200 in the morning and im still telling myself just one more turn the gameplay starts off relatively simple but without a decent amount of planning and game knowledge you will almost certainly lose normally losing a game after ive sunk 5 hours into it wouldnt be fun but what this game does is unlock an unbelievable amount of new content as you play the amount being tied to how well you do during events by my third run i had practically a whole new tech tree with gamechanging components filling the gaps in my strategy and ifeeling like i had earned themi was amazing

what to say about the design of the game its incredibly charming youre given direction over a bunch of simpleminded little pips who accomplish their tasks with a smile on their face and the bouncy animations never got boring to look at the music didnt hurt my ears at all which was a plus and for such a limited color palette and resolution the sprites all have a wonderful level of detail and depth to them

possibly the only thing that i would say wasnt my favorite about this game was that it took me 20 hours in one run to beat it the game was certainly designed to take that long but by the very end i found myself clicking through as my victory had been assured for at least twenty turns already and i couldnt be bothered to keep optimizing part of this problem was that by the end of the game i had exactly 100 pips at my command which according to the dev is more than necessary and i agree unfortunately youre almost guaranteed to lose halfway through the game if you dont spend the first couple chapters producing as many pips as humanly possible as the benefits of an increased population outweigh the detriments in every single way overall though im not that miffed at this as i could probably have made less pips and still been fine

in conclusion i will say that this game is one of the best i have ever played the amount of content available from your first run would have been more than enough to entrance me for twenty hours and you must believe me when i say its mindboggling the amount of bonus content that unlocks as you play i can see why it took the dev nine years to finish the game

speaking of the dev hes very involved in the community listens to feedback etc which i think is an amazing thing that has made the game ten times better have a good one catman

1010

#####

very fun very engaging with brain

#####

ill just play one more turn

#####

this is a great chill city builder game i like that it feels unique compared to moat other city builders highly recommend this one

#####

is good

#####

cons youll forget everything because youll be addicted to dotage
pros youll forget everything because youll be addicted to dotage

#####

this game is brutal deep wonderful and fulfilling the art might make you think twice but i urge you to see past it and explore dotage is an incredible achievement from a communicative developer and it feels like there is still so so much more for me to see twenty hours in that im excited every time i open the game and also scared because i have things to do to stay alive in real life

as a side note its also a flawless experience on steam deck and as a turnbased game the deck is such a great place to play

#####

very fun to play on the edge mid to late game scaling makes the game easier later on than it is at the start if you are familiar with base building  resource management games you can probably start on hard i started my first playthrough on normal and have just about finished my first run as a win

fwiw runs can be rather lengthy so if you dont want to invest a lot of time into a potential loss do normal anyway

#####

ran out of food on the fifth day of winter because i had forgotten that i played a vegan village sent my doctor round with a vat of potion telling everybody that food is just a snare for the spirit and that they were feeling a lot better worked too 
great game

#####

good game that pulls you in and doesnt let go its a bit disappointing that you cant expand past the edges to increase your map size once you learn how to remove trees and mountains but i guess one can only ask for so much

#####

this is the first time i am doing a review of a game i do so now simply because this game really deserves the attention incredibly fun surprising challenging replayable without getting bored a second  it was even fun to learn how to play by doing mistakes and having to start over just because the game is made with so much fun creativity and love

one can easily adjust the difficultylevel but be careful  it may start nicely but soon you will think oh no no no no no what to do now how can i still save my people but then you cant but then it works out yet because of some kind of surprising intervention or it gets even worse  you really never know and all is packed into this creative loving world built up differently for every game 

i also love that the game takes time one plays in day to day turns season by season repeating until the final doomsday is won and all the domains challenge you at the same time the game keeps you busy all the way preparing for whats to come and adjusting to new circumstances and if you think you finally understood how the game works you have the option to choose another leading character with tricky new rules to discover and react to its mindblowing really

thank you michele for doing such great work in creating a positive challenging and fun game 

and i do love the soundtrack as well

a few game hours later nothing to add but one tiny thing just when you thought a game could not get any cuter there came santa and his elves its really fun to see santa in this merciless game d

#####

an amazing chill cardbased city builder pixel graphics pastel color palette and minimal game design are supported by good storytelling and cozy music it is clear that the developer put their heart and soul into this

let it be known to that developer you have something to be proud of here great game 

also plays good on steam deck although a better controller support like these doomed isles would be great

#####

this is a nice little pearl made with love and passion fun and technically made with attention to every detail
the one more turn effect is guaranteed a must have

#####

really fantastic i dont review games often but the amount of care and thought that went into this is obvious from the first playthrough perhaps there are other games like it but this scratched an itch for me that i didnt know i had the game already feels more than complete but theres also so much room to take it further if the dev desires 

its challenging and significantly more complex than it looks at first glance but the way the mechanics expand for the player is really a great lesson in core game design principles 

highly recommend if youre on the fence at all

#####

dotage is a very addictive turnbased city builder rougelike akin to something along the lines of civ or against the storm its incredibly fun and theres tons of variety in each game you play not only that but the creator of the game is accessible for any game breaking bugs suggestions or anything else you need i managed to get myself softlocked in a way that wouldnt let me end my turn so i reached out on discord and the creator fixed it within 24 hours you can tell their heart and soul went into making this game and i will be enjoying it for many hours to come

#####

a wonderfully simple yet challenging village management game  dotage has a great build up of difficulty featureability unlocks and variability to make for a thoroughly enjoyable and repeatable game ty for this wonderful game

#####

really great  addictive

#####

wonderful city builder you can tell it was made with a lot of love 3
lots of interesting mechanics where everything feels like it fits together really tight game loops that feels great to play

#####

really charming citybuilder roguelite highly recommend giving this a shot

#####

very good i love it very cute and a lot more content than i expected d

#####

so i am inconveniently impressed and frustrated dotage is all ive been think about for the last 34 days coming from a guy whos spent over 1000 hours playing city builders i have to say this is one of the most interesting and innovative approach ive seen in awhile

it really shows all the blood sweat and tears that went into making the game ironically the top three builders on my list have all been passion projects of one lonely engineer 

dotage really shines in its simplicity and outrageous complexity later in the game the roguelike progression on the memorytech tree doesnt just reward you it also introduces new elements that actually make the game harder and more complex it keeps up with your experience playing and keeps the game interesting 

punishment for failure to meet objectives is harsh and swift ie i literally got wiped out missing an event in the winter another situation for example was simple oversight of building placement which left pips abandoned in the winter boom wiped out

long story short i hate you and i thank you its been a really really long time since i came across a game that consumed me like dotage 

note the mechanics for being rewarded for meeting objectives should also be tied to reducing future difficulty i know it happens occasionally but ive been wiped out by simply missing one omen it just kept getting harder and i couldnt keep up it was frustrating not fun

#####

the game starts simple but the premise is endearing and the complexity ramps up remarkably quickly  you soon come to realise that this is not the game you first thought it was it is something much much better

#####

great game super addicting has that darkest dungeon panic that i love so much

#####

h1tldrh1

this is city builder with randomly generated maps vs environmental random events with a hint of roguelite packaged in a turnbased mode the hell does that even mean 

bits fun afb

the mechanics keep growing with gradually more wrenches thrown at the player coupled with tools to unwrench those monkeys its a really fun juggle of building a strategy only to have to quickly pivot because of a new threat the best part is the omen system the player can see the threats coming and plan accordingly up to a point once the threats are tackled a new round of threats is generated requiring revaulation of strategies

if you like strategy city builders with the chaos of ifairi rng where every failure feels like a learning experience and an understanding that oh yeah i dun did screw that up without the that was bs feeling this is a great atyourpace game it is at once relaxing as all hell and stressful in the best way everything just went to poop theres a demo its pretty sauce of the awesome kind

h1the rambleh1

holy mother of apple bananas theres a lot going on in this game and my god does it do a damn decent job of being mostly intuitive

first up the cons

some core basic stuff is not explained clear enough like how to expand the area of influence the forced tutorial system is annoying with do exactly this explainations and leave a lot to be desired when it comes to important things like how to remove a profession from a pip the tooltips are a bit lacking especially when it comes to hoverover and when it comes to the more complex production chains for example when hovering over happiness trait it gives a flavor text description rather than say what actual effect it has the production chains are unclear until you have a whole bunch of research unlocked and tediously move around the tech tree trying to connect the chain mentally the player should be able to hover over bread and have relevant links show up and be able to navigate easily following that chain without having to manually go back and forth strikea lot of the animations are unskippable and show each individual pip getting an effect seeing the animation for a pip gathering each one talking gibberish then getting sick then throwing up while not being able to skip or speed up animations gets tedious when an event affects more than 3 pipsstrike fixed in between me writing this damn thing and going back to the game example of how frickin quickly dev fixes things theres some balancing issues with buildings and certain building chains but hey work in progress whats there is already pretty damn fantastic

now the pros

learning the game is a hell of a lot of fun figuring out 1 space does not include diagonals buildings that have synergy that require a different research and optimizing the research placement and readjustment all the while everyones starving and on fire and its my fault is great going into the next run full of confidence with newfound understanding only to be thrown a different set of problems to repeat the process is great because eventually it just clicks cake is had and progress is made the constant juggle of food heatcold population expansion tech progression city planning and optimizations is so stimulating because its turn based all of this chaos feels manageable and screw ups many turns ago can lead to catastrophic failure tools to handle and fix those failures and introduced and a pretty decent pace so far anyways and the dev seems to be very responsive and active in player feedback

the ability to see ahead to what disasters the player has to deal with theres enough time to either fight against it or prepare for the consequences failing is punishing but not game ending unless repeated theres a snowball effect that rewards success and punishes failure but most of it is temporary outside of the big ol apocolyptic events this balance gives good incentive to succeed while still giving room to recover from failures and falling from grace from overconfidence

the buildings can get pretty complex with proximity bonuses and even further with certain runpermanent boon effects many of which changes the way a player may want to layout their toys its like a really fun reshuffling of a backpack optimization feels very rewarding as it goes from barely surviving to going what totally unnecessary production chain do i want to add to this mess

i cant frickin stress enough how good the game loop feels of getting bashed in the face with a hammer learning to dodge said hammer wallow in sheer frickin hubris only to get smacked by a dumptruck full of kittens

#####

easily a top contender for goty in the genre  the mechanics and level of planning makes this a joy to play especially when everything comes together  i cannot wait to see future improvements to the game and what else the developer has in store

#####

excellent

#####

at first glance dotage may seem easy and casual but dont be fooled 99 of the game is hidden behind the massive progression tree memories that unlocks hundreds of mechanics events new buildings upgrades tools and visitors generally im not a fan of roguelite but dotage got it right every time your village succumbs to doom you unlock new things that will help you on your next run and its exciting

#####

what an awesome city building roguelite game

the goal is to create a successful village from scratch which involves a lot of understanding of the existing mechanics  careful planning based on the resources you have and the known troubles coming your way

ultimately the game revolves around randomness specifically in the events you face and the terrain you start with including what resources are available this might make the game a lot more predictable the more you play similiar to what you might get with deckbuilding roguelike games

do note that there are approx 5 variation of difficulties which are 25 50 100 200 and unknown ascension levels maybe the reason im saying this is because part of what discouraged me from playing it earlier was the sheer difficulty of the system that and so much to learn i strongly reccomend playing at 50 difficulty for your first run to familiarize yourself with the mechanics and unlock as much content early as possible a majority of which provides aidsboons too

overall the game is a blast to play and learning the mechanics and improving little by little makes the game continuously interesting on top of that while you may come to a point of being fully aware of whats what id reckon this is s till going to be a great replay value game irregardless much like how in slay the spire for example you already know what enemies moveset decks are available but you can still replay the game and play through new scenarios

#####

tried the demo and loved it bought the full game and there is a lot more content to discover the dev spent 9 years on this game and it is very polished

#####

old man yells at clouds claiming the end of the world the turnbased city builder video game

#####

this game took me 30 mins to write a review it is that good at first glance you might think oh yet another nope not this one the humor is surprisingly mature thank you and intelligent most games of this genre are realtime but not dotage making it turn based to me is one of the best design decisions also if you played the demo version you can play on seemlessly with the full version
get the demo the magic of dotage is in every little detail which has to be experienced by playing it

this game puts a smile on my face with almost every click well done

#####

very cozy and stressful i love the music as well as the animations of all the villagers very cute and you can tell how much care and attention was poured into this game i really suck and its a little difficult but im having fun figuring it out 

#####

loving it so far

#####

fun city builder with unique concept

#####

ive had to restart my village twice already while playing on easy mode and its the best thing thats ever happened to me dotage is so addictive and enjoyable that of i couldnt play anything else ever again id be stoked lets go round village round 3

#####

disregard the third paragraph im changing my review from negative to positive the developer of this game is clearly very dedicated to their passion project and helping its players have fun and enjoy it they personally walked me through the trouble i was having in getting dotage to work and they used the feedback to improve the game 

the visuals are charming and remind me of a few titles i used to play on my gameboy advance when i was a child though i think they are more inspired by old pc titles moreso its the colors it uses that give me a sense of nostalgia rather than the style i also appreciate that the musical score is comprised of techno renditions of classic medieval tunes i recognized one of my alltime favorite songs in this games soundtrack stella splendens which i used to listen to as part of the album vox vulgaris all the time when i was in college so its an absolute joy to get to play this game now that the issue i had with it has been resolved

strike its essentially unplayable within the first three minutes of the game it asks you to place a building called a thinkers hut but if you dont have any pips available to build it the interface wont let you exit out to unassign a pip from picking berries in order to be ready for building it just says follow the tutorial the only thing to do is press esc and give up or quit the game but then the game is permanently bugged and will never let you place any buildings on future attempts so its just a berrypicking simulator strike

#####

this game slid by my timeline on totally not twitter i was like ooo pixel town sim and then i saw that my village could be lit on fire and i was sold
it looks simple at first but there is sooooo much under the hood of this game with a tech tree and memories that unlock new things will you win the random luck on a 6733 roll or will you lose the 20 chance to spawn a disaster

going into winter i had a choice between suddenly obtaining 50 berries or all my pips being able to eat water not sure how you eat water but ill take it

really happy this game showed up on my timeline i enjoy watching my village light itself on fire 

#####

its a tile placement worker placement board game mixed with the settlers 2 wrapped up in a roguelike progression system i could not stand the sound design but that just cements it as a good game to play while listening to podcasts has a demo so you can try before you buy

#####

another great example of mixing citybuilder and roguelike mechanics it is absolutely wonderful

#####

i like it but dang does it feel like work sometimes i get so stressed

#####

incredibley addictive and very well made

#####

dotage is an enjoyable lightfeeling city builder the graphics are a little bland but the dev clearly put some time into animating the buildings and villagers pips to make them feel at least a little alive
your pips arent as individually important as characters in a game like rimworld its more about modifying the map by carefully placing building chains to produce special resources necessary to prevent bad semirandom events from occurring these events eventually lead to the apocalypse which tests your ability to produce all of the eventrelated resources very quickly

the buildings you have access to are somewhat randomized per run but runs are much longer than a single map on against the storm you can unlock new buildings elders who affect which buildings you can use and how they work and entire mechanics for later runs such as pets and minievents both of which can generate bonus resources

while the game is enjoyable to muddle through unlocking plenty of tertiary content that will be useful on higher difficulties it isnt perfect it does chug a little when you have close to the games soft cap on pips 50 and even though you can produce a surplus of resources to guarantee a good outcome for an event check which are effectively a diceroll without a large surplus you can still get bad results im assuming these are better than a bad outcome but normal mode was easy enough to get through without losing a single pip or failing a single event check the game is also still receiving some needed qualityoflife updates such as automatically swapping out pips with needed professions for certain buildings you still sometimes need to manually turn buildings offon to get the right ones to the right places



overall i do recommend dotage the price is fair and the game is entertaining

#####

as quaint wideranging and dark soulsishly punishing as spreadsheet gaming can get yes youll be optimizing inputs and outputs and stockpiling truly gluttonous quantities of consumer goods but in dotage sometimes bricks are made out of flour and sometimes flour is made out of seeds and sometimes a funny man comes to live with you so the grand strategy mindset must be set aside for a more wily and indeed roguish sensibility a huge variety of buildings resources and demongod challenges will wildly vary what is good or bad from run to run and the squishy chunky murmury interface is intoxicating throughout

if you think youd like this then you probably will

#####

damn what a game i havent been immersed in a strategy game since the first time i discovered civilization very strategic and charming game building placement is a constant puzzle without being overly restrictive only minor complaint is the way professions work kinda annoying to reassign or hunt for the pip with the appropriate profession and swap them around

#####

this game is fun challenging and has a good amount of unlockables to keep things new and different i really like the retro synth music the glorious pixel graphics and the gameplay is engaging at the price point it is easy to recommend for what you get

#####

best hidden gem 2023 award

#####

play this game

#####

very fun and challenging

#####

far more complex than i originally thought i can already feel the hours slipping away

#####

im sorry dev i love you and i think you are amazing for what you have done but the game is just too long  either it is meant to be played over and over or you play it a few times  i have played 11 hours still not done with the first run and the game is excruciatingly slow with many pips as i just spam next turn waiting for the events  the nighttime animations with production and food take so long  

maybe some players will have fun with this game and i had fun for the first 78 hours but it just does not have any staying power for me

i started playing other things and the desire to continue my settlement and grind to the end of the scrolls just was not there

#####

this game is fun but runs are a bit too long if you survive year 1 from what ive seen youre basically guaranteed to be able to win the run due to how snowbally the game is after year 1 theres no more tension or much strategy involved so the game becomes a bit boring

#####

damn they werent lying that single run can 13 hours

but more seriously i really enjoyed this
its very obvious how much love and care has gone into this game
i pretty much breezed by the apocalypse but i imagine it will be much more difficult with future runs especially with my plans to play on harder difficulties and the new overpipulation mechanics

bravo developer bravo

#####

a masterpiece

#####

great game excellent polish worth the purchase

#####

i usually dont leave reviews but after i bought this game i played for 24 hours straight so it definitely deserves a positive review
the only complaint i have gameplay wise is that if the strong domain you get is the temperature related one it is significantly harder than the others
 it generally worked very well on the steam deck but occasionally the resource ui would just disappear and the game would have to be restarted other than that no issues

#####

its pretty good i have absolutely no idea why people are comparing this to rimworld its nothing like rimworld at all its a little base management sim

#####

really nice and well crafted game turn based is a smart idea while you are supposed to chill and turn based but the game turns out to be very addictive and such a time sink

i like that you can unlock modules as more you play and every run has a bit different tech tree  add some variants to each run is awesome

however i feel the game still being a bit repetitive after a few runs i dont think this a game you expect to play consistently but at least it provides me 10 happy hours great 

#####

it a brilliant turnbased city builder that doesnt bother me too badly when everything goes to t as it most definitely almost always does you can even play as santa in july if you darn well please because this developer gets that timed exclusives suck

#####

key given by dev

 ui scaling
 full keyboard rebinding
 alternate fonts clean and dyslexic
 screen shake and flash optional disabler
 no way to disable edge panning
 alternate light on dark ui could literally invert it
 bold plain font option arial bold is my personal go to but whatever works
 hardware cursor option or at least an alternate where the cursor doesnt move on its own
 gamma or brightness toggle option game is very bright
 option to disable edge panning
 grid mode option bold high contrast lines id advise 2 or 3 degrees of thicknessvisibility

#####

like factorio this is basically digital crack cocaine

#####

i knew i had to take a break when the game unlocked an achievement for 5 hours of playtime thats how good it is

#####

civ meets dwarf fortress meets stardew valley if that sounds like something that would interest you you will almost certainly enjoy this game

#####

i really like the game its a little like simcity a little like the settlers a little like black  white a little like populous to each game to which it is a little similar it takes the best parts its a great puzzling and planning game it runs on windows and linux with minimal specs its worth the price

#####

passion project indeed   bought this after the demo was recommended on reddit   everyone else has lots to say so i will add that it reminds me of agricola  every decision is hard   every resource is strained  this is going in the legendary indy shelf alongside ftl itb etc   my plan is to play another few turns and get back to you

#####

i really liked the game for a couple of hours but after the first couple games the underlying system issues revealed themselves

this is a game early game is interesting because you have to make tough choices but it turns into a collect everything kind of game later on you simply need to research every tech and harvest everything the game has to offer its not really subtle and barely involves any strategy 

if you happen to not have enough production of something the game is over if some random events is not in your favor the game is over 

the randomness factor is too high the player agency too low

the game that comes to mind that does this but better is against the storm against the storm understood how to encourage players to make their own build and play their own way by substituting one ressource for another with a penalty for example

#####

i both love and hate this game its not for those trying to have fun it is a great way to kill time and get frustrated about things that are completely out of your control its a great game for learning to be content while the world catches fire

#####

lay on the couch eat chips and watch all your little italians die from hiarrhoea while the village burns to the ground 1010

#####

very neat turnbased resource management game also despite looking somewhat simplistic it actually contains quite a lot of content and variations which heavily affect your playthroughs and create a lot of replayability

its not exactly problemfree  there are still some bugs and pacing might be a bit on a slow side but the dev its created by one person is already working on improving that

#####

this game is a lot more fun than expected and the devs is crazy productive in a good way  would recommend to everyone who likes building and similar games

#####

be me
fight off every domain
nature domain got 50 oh shit
quick research strong altars make green bar 90
lose the roll
sinkhole 84 tiles

not even mad just kinda happy its not over yet and i get to do it all over again with nature protection earlier

cute game lovely graphics great sound tracks good system for resource management building and research system is great pips with jobs feel useful even if their building is inactive

random aspect can feel annoying but thats the point of it wouldnt be much of a challenge otherwise weathers feel good wish they happened more so you could take advantage of them

randomised building are all fine but i usually restart if i get the mountain spring its too hard to fit into my buildings later on papercutter with wood is usually a pass too since ill need 2 knifemasters to supply 2 scriptoriums instead of 1 watcher for 2 scriptoriums

i still havent seen a mushroom field after 200h and my disappointment is immeasurable

some people want a faster mode but id love a longer one bigger mapmaybe some fog of war until you discover the area slower research game was over before i had a chance to really use the biggest houses and town centre or the final buildings in general

lovely game good settings 1010

#####

this game is a throwback to what made pc games of the 90s great with all the modern niceties and quality of life layered on top

#####

very nice game well made nice art nice music funny and difficult enough to have fun while still being challenging

i had to say though the game starts to have heavy performance problems once you reach 100 villagers which is a shame because the whole point is to scale the highest possible and once you reach 100150 villager the game freeze all the time and drops to very low fps i have a 12700k cpu and 3080 gpu

other than that the game is great

#####

awesome

#####

games like this make me happy im autistic

#####

played it with my partner as a copilot and we both had much fun great indie game 
good job michele 

love from france

#####

it was prophesied that i would write this review

#####

this is easily one of my top 3 games of the year its like the xcom of farming simulators

genuinely the best most successful attempt ive ever seen of translating tabletop worker placement mechanics in to a videogame

#####

just one more day

#####

btldr a series of subtly great design decisions particularly as regards antifrustration ux mechanismsb

i glanced at the store page at some point and concluded that this game didnt interest me at all then a friend bought it for me so i started playing it on stream for him

im impressed

its not any specific thing that makes this game spectacular its just a series of good uiux decisions that make it consistently interesting and easily enjoyable over and over and over ive thought well itd be nice if i could just do something like this  and upon doing it found that the result was exactly what i wanted

i thought a game of this complexity would become overwhelming but it gives you almost every conceivable tool to manage the information at your disposal in useful and intuitive ways and the ones it doesnt give you are on the devs list to update soon i peeked when i watched my friend play he was using entirely different methods than i was to find useful information because each of us had naturally tried a different initial approach and found that it worked thats kind of amazing

i dont usually go in on basebuilding games i normally favor games with deep story rich characterization and great writing this game has passable story and the bare minimum of characterization to stretch over its bones the writing is decently charming but nothing remarkable however the gameplay  in particular in the aspect of approachability the smoothness of the incline under the players feet while they strive to overcome the more obvious hurdles of the games intended challenges  stands out whenever i would nearly be frustrated or overwhelmed i find something solves that problem for me

the difficulty is also adjustable to your tastes and this allows it to be at your preference a casual basebuilding game or a tense race for survival against divine forces that seek to annihilate your civilization there are also features intended to aid in replayability and the at the time of this writing last unlockable character is exactly what the last unlockable character ought to be to encourage and abet folks in continuing to play even with no more unlocks to attain

really outstanding work and even though it currently feels like a complete experience its still being updated as the dev identifies fixes and features i didnt even know it was missing

#####

good

#####

fun in the beginning and pretty addicting but games lasts too long and become tedious and pretty micromanagement heavy

#####

chilled out singleplayer agricola

#####

super cool game 42 hours in won with 3 chars just a few memories left to unlock a very original take on roguelikes dont be frustrated if you dont survive your first few runs great polish and nice humor if you want a cute miniciv with humor this is the one great for travelingplaying on laptops too

#####

a cute turnbased resource management game that makes me think without needing 510 hours for a complete playthrough i enjoy having a roguelite twist on this genre of strategy game the sprite art is adorable and a lot of the writing is cheeky i have had a blast playing it so far

#####

this game is brutal cute and funny random map at start  events kill your pips and repeat but what keeps this fresh is the memories system  each run gives you memory pieces which can help or hinder your next run

the art style is pixelly and kinda cute but beneath its exterior is a brutally hard survival colony builder

negatives i have are tad unclear  and it becomes a trial by fire sometimes figuring how to get seeds was not fun it also has a destinct lack of fedoras p 

910 from me

#####

 its exactly what i was looking for  a tight well balanced roguelike city builder i discovered this genre with against the storm i love it and there are so few games in this genre

the only negative for me is that one playtrough is quite long i would say 8 hours maybe i would prefer something around 23 hours

only discovered this game long before it was released thanks to demigiant

#####

highly recommended pulled me in from the first few minutes and kept me taking turns to build my village just that bit more 

interesting and fun balance of mechanics that doesnt get too tedious providing enough management that the time based does not feel slow 
events are super varied and come often enough that youre engaged but not so often youre overwhelmed 
i saw roguelite and was nervous i would be doing the same exact gameplay loop over and over but the villages in this game can last a long time good if you dont want to give up your beauty 

the demo is just the first 45 minutes or so of the game and  your progress from the demo carries over  there is no reason not to try the demo and see if you like the concept you can buy and immediately load into your same village with the next things available 

try the demo its worth the buy

gr8

#####

i cant stop playing it help

#####

the way this game opens up further and further with each new in game day and season is just so cool you expect to build some woodcutters build some houses forage  all the usual stuff of city survival sims and suddenly you see that there can be mini events in which villagers insult each other another guy gets superstitious because he saw a crow that looked at him funny once

and if you dont counter act these outcomes with some oneononewetime at a table with some food the fear might just roll over your whole town and everyone disappears into the woods 

its good so good that if the fear domain was real id just have to sit down and play this for a day to rescue the village

#####

beautifully written mechanically satisfying and endlessly addictive dotage feels like playing a game of chess against yourself while your house is on fire  but like more fun

#####

this game is super fun and addictive
both cozy and brutal at the same time
but never annoyingly frustrating

i love all the cute little pips and their sounds the humor and how the game can feel both relaxing and really challenging at the same time

#####

roguelike board game city builder

#####

cat is vip

#####

phenomenal city builder great mechanics every turn feels important and thoughtful this game was made with a ton of love and it shows

#####

very good

#####

took me 30 hours to win 1010

#####

this is a great game its frustrating at first so just expect your city to be destroyed the first few tries it becomes easier the more you unlock watching your city implode can be fun too like rolling poorly in your 2nd winter and having a fight club break out injuring half your city including all your healers my stomach always drops a bit when my pips walk off and start doing something whatcha doing

#####

fun hard witty

#####

this delightful turnbased roguelike city builder has had a full hold on my attention for the past week since i first tried it  the great aesthetic and sound design will draw you in but the engaging strategic gameplay and challenge will keep you hooked  the roguelike part of it is very well done  the starting map generation randomized tech trees for each run occurrence of random events and obstacles and the diversity in the starting factions you can play as all push you towards an experience where you have to work through novel problems each run based on the procedural generation and starting conditions
the game has metaprogression in the form of unlocks but outside of the higher difficulty and elder unlocks which personally i wouldnt mind seeing sooner you unlock new content at a pace where you feel like you are getting a good amount of variety each run and i havent felt that i was being held back by not having something unlocked
the runs can be quite long id love to see a condensed mode that takes around half the time to complete to really get at that one more run roguelike feel

#####

boring repetitive after about a day of playing i realized im not going to experience anything new

some people have compared it to rimworld so i really wanted to like it but gameplay is way too restrictive for that comparison

not necessarily a hard no but i cant say i recommend it

#####

i can see the appeal but i find it quite boring and very restrictive

its a city management type game  you assign what needs to be accomplished for the day and then end the day to do it over againand againand again  you slowly progress into better buildings and resources by researching everything  youre set on a clock essentially to try to protect your village from bad events  it will tell you when an event is coming and give you a chance to influence the outcome 

each day each villager requires one food  youre given berry bushes around your area but they run out  so you have to get your food up and running before you use up your berry bushes  on top of that you need wood to build everything so you have to assign a villager to that too  then you need research points to research further so you need a villager researching  then to expand you need to have 2 free villagers and a free housing slot  as an example the game feels like youre given 10 villagers with 9 things that need a villager each day but you also have to expand so you have to sacrifice a day of doing something to get another villager but then to expand you need the 10th villager to do the same thing every day and you wait for your 11th villager to grow  it feels like you only have a little amount of choice  ive read reviews from people who have gotten to end game and they say they are just spamming the end turn button without actually reassigning villagers

this game just seems really unfun as a whole but challenging because youre given little choice as to what needs to happen  i definitely would not pay more than 5 for this game  if you want to play a better game look at stacklands

#####

one of my villagers felt it necessary to back flip into the nearby lake then complained to me that they were wet 1010

#####

i love it its like rim world meets stardew valley its challenging has delpth and is quite pretty i love the real world clock and with it being turn based its great for if you have kids or other commitments

#####

i have yet to beat the game or unlock a majority of the memories however i have really enjoyed the way this game plays it has a good blend of colonycity management like going medievalrimworldanno 1800 i only discovered this game through the demo featured with nextfest i was pretty hesitant about spending 17 on this type of game but after digging in there is a level of quality and polish that makes the game more worth the price given the evident replayability offered via random mapstech situations and events it is clear the dev put several years in to reach this stage on my first run the game started off with two pips fighting but after many days those two became good friends and survived a nasty winter that i didnt have the tech to deal with but that added to the fun as i did make it through on a second run i started with a drastically different environment allowing me to change strategies on how to go about food i will say that the demo is a great way to see what is going on with this one many demos cut you off pretty fast but this one gives the player a bit of time to see some of the playthrough options i also want to emphasize that the tech tree changes depending on the map on the demofull unlock run i had tomatoes chicken and a specific well for example however on another run i was presented with carrots fish and a different well those are just a few differences i would suggest this game to someone looking for a chill strategy game that is turnbased and has an active dev who puts out updates at a steady rate for one person this game isnt in early access which is also important to note

#####

a me piace

#####

as a dev i know this is important i love it so far its cute and fun ill play more and update

#####

one of those games where i like everything about it apart from the game itself
like the idea like the way it looks and sounds but find the gameplay to be frustrating grindy and a bit joyless
despite the simple looking graphics nothing about it feels obvious or intuitive
theres a blizzard of popups trying to explain things but still found myself having to constantly google
the complexity means its hard to get a proper feel for it within the 2 hour refund window

#####

if civilization games are a full 9 course meal dotage is a charcuterie board  simpler but satisfying with just enough complexity and intrigue

delectable delightful justonemoreturn gameplay yes i am gay why do you a

#####

amazing game learning might come with losing a run badly but once you get a feel for the game it is so good and you will play for hours also it is excellent that any pip can have a kid with another pip as a trans woman i wish it worked like that in real life but having it in this game is great

#####

this game makes my brain produce dopamine for hours and hours and hours and hours

#####

in an age where the gaming industry is saturated with sequels remakes and formulaic entries dotage emerges like a breath of fresh air reminding us all of the boundless possibilities that creativity and innovation can offer

from the outset the games unique art style captures ones attention its pixelated charm pays homage to the classics while seamlessly integrating modern aesthetics and technologies this serves as a testament to the games commitment to bridging the old with the new which is a recurrent theme throughout

the gameplay is both intuitive and challenging a fine balance that many games aspire to but few achieve its intricate mechanics and systems are introduced progressively ensuring that players of all skill levels can find both enjoyment and challenge the world is brimming with detail each corner teeming with hidden secrets waiting to be uncovered this depth keeps players engaged encouraging exploration and rewarding curiosity

the narrative of dotage is without a doubt its crowning jewel its a tapestry of emotions carefully woven with threads of humor sorrow mystery and hope the characters are endearingly flawed making them both relatable and memorable as you journey alongside them you cant help but become invested in their individual quests hoping for their successes and mourning their setbacks

what truly sets dotage apart however is its dedication to tackling deeper often overlooked themes in the gaming world issues of aging the passage of time and the importance of memories are explored with both sensitivity and depth the game invites players to introspect to ponder and ultimately to grow

in conclusion dotage is more than just a game its an experience its a reminder of why many of us fell in love with gaming in the first place it challenges entertains and enlightens earning its place not just in our game libraries but in our hearts in a world that often moves too quickly dotage prompts us to pause reflect and appreciate the beauty of the journey

#####

this game has a really bad new player experience it lets you access paths in the research tree that are completely useless because you need something from another section in order to access it and this will result in you losinghaving a bad run because you wasted time researching something useless and lost momentum

#####

such a good survival game

#####

really fun

#####

this game is so much fun and is so worth getting

#####

this game is more important then food more nourishing then water more pleasurable then xxx

#####

really enjoyed this it gave me the same vibes as a strategy board game 

swapped between desktop and steam deck and both worked great

for strategy veterans the normal difficulty might be a bit on the relaxing side and i dont mean that negatively

#####

absolutely one of the best games ive played i really hope this gets more attention

#####

an elegantly designed and charmingly presented game which knits contrasting genres into an innovative and addictive sock of fun

#####

the game is very simple on its face your only daily task is to assign the days work to your pips half the time they will be doing what they were doing the day before  accessibility is important and this game is very easy to interface with and understand

on normal i imagine the game itself is pretty easy it is recommended for strategy veterans to start on hard which i did and it feels urgent and uncertain like i feel it ought to there are two harder difficulties dont let the cutesy graphics and simple interface mislead you you will be challenged

the game runs smoothly on the worst pcs not everyone has a topoftheline gaming rig  and even those who do often have a crappy laptop that theyd like games for this is perfect for that person

i can tell that i am going to get my moneys worth out of this


#####

a game that youre sad to beat but you want to start a new run as soon as youre done

#####

cool game a bit too long

#####

i picked this game up at the recommendation of friend who is also a single indie dev and ive got to say that i have very much enjoyed it thus far theres alot of heart and charm on display here id recommend buying it on sale if youre feeling uncertaini bought it full price and i dont regret my choice to

its a good little city builder there are a handful of qol improvements to be made but the dev is actually quite active and responsive so i have no doubt that hell provide such over his updates overally i highly recommend dotage 

#####

was looking forward to a cute fun game with great humor and unexpectedly got my rear end handed to me on a plate with a side of berries i could have used like 6 turns ago this game is surprisingly addicting and fun to play even just keeping it open as background noise is somewhat comforting as i go about my day making a turn here and there then surprise theres a cat and i was so happy about it i still dont know what the cat does but im here for it

if anything i need an event that it literally rains cats and dogs but all in all its a great laugh fun gameplay and looks like an awesome christmas gift yeah d

#####

thank you

#####

a ton of fun especially after you get the hang of it

#####

excellent game i am still playing 

#####

i fuck summers and fuck fires  

#####

very addictive gameplay closest comparison would be rimworld but turn based special thanks to splattercatgaming for recommending this

#####

it is really good the only con being that theres no child labor

#####

when i am not playing dota2 i am playing dotage and i have just as much fun playing this quirky survival city builder as dota2 reminds if it was frostpunk but you can see the future so much fun

#####

pip

#####

i really wanted to like this game but it is pretty shallow and the roguelikerng elements dont really add much if youve ever played a free browser civilizationstyle clicker game this is basically just that there is so little to actually do once you are set up and the game kind of plays itself  the game loop seems pretty dry and at times even nonexistent as you just pass hundreds of turns doing the same thing for hours on end waiting for something to happen each turn takes an incredibly long time even if you decide to skip it completely because of tiresome animations and because certain things need to play out onebyone ie if 10 villagers get a status effect you need to click through and watch 10 animations  dialogue or if you have more resources than you can hold you need to watch each individual resource slowly drain one at a time the challenges in the game basically just require you to spend resources for a few turns and are checks to make sure you have the proper research if you are just starting out you might get screwed by these mechanics because it is literally luck based unless you are well over your quota granted i am playing on normal and i havent completed an entire run yet but i dont know how much you are expected to invest in order to start enjoying a game

#####

great turn based management game

#####

i am stunned for 3 days ffs games hard lol

#####

fun

#####

game is purposefully impossibly difficult until you play multiple times game was fun until the domains started talking plot is very cringe the gameplay loop devolves into appeasing gods and the apocalypse just is sadistic not fun when you get unlucky rng with the event timing developer really wants you to replay multiple times just to beat it once that would only work if runs didnt take over 10 hours the music even gets really repetitive
worst part is the progression system makes the game even harder and more convoluted but doesnt feel good

#####

one pip burped and was stunned for 3 days 1010

#####

me like it

#####

this is the ultimate just one more turn game for me  i had never played it before opened it up and lost 6 hours  now im not going to get enough sleep for work  1010

#####

this is the most addictive gameplay loop ive ever played i wish i had more hours to sink into this absolutely recommend if you enjoy strategy games and unlockables

#####

great but unforgiving game definitely recommend for those that enjoy a challenge

#####

update i decided to abandon the normal difficulty run i beat the game on harder 200 difficulty barring a few silly mistakes i was again able to 100 every event but at least this time its a fun challenge and not boring so im changing the review to positive ill try out the hardest difficulty and see what i think

original negative review

i know that this is made by one developer and i fully respect that im not saying that this is a bad game its just that my experience so far isnt positive

when i saw the game is rougelike and be ready to lose i expected that i would play for at most an hour in a single game but i started a game on normal 100 difficulty and 7 hours in im still on it not only that i beat 3 prophecy pages with 100 on every random event  in other words it hasnt even been a challenge for me maybe im just good at this resource management thing

so now im kind of stuck should i abandon this run and try a higher difficulty but i also want to see what the game has to offer without having to go through those 7 hours again but if i dont turn up the difficulty would it just be a boring grind till the finish line i dont want that either im just not motivated to play the game anymore

compounding the problem is that there isnt an interface to easily manage jobs or maybe it exists but i didnt find it i have to go around the map to change job assignments in the game lore the village elder has to go around telling everyone what to do every day  yeah its painful

on top of that is the pixel graphics i know some people like it and clearly the dev put a lot of love into it but for me its really an extra hurdle when i need to find things on my screen props to the dev to at least put in alternative fonts including a dyslexic accessible one otherwise i wouldnt even considered playing this game

so yeah i think ill take some time to play the game a bit more and see if ill change my mind

#####

喜欢的人喜欢的游戏我也喜欢一下

#####

recommended

#####

great game

#####

its basically turn based rimworld brilliant

#####

do you love rimworld but want a more fast paced version based on turns rather than ticks boy is this the game for you 

like rimworld the hates you hates you and wants you to die

but like rimworld its annoyingly addictive and i must beat the apocalypse

#####

what a brilliant game so much depth to it and i can see already that i will play this again and again and again if you enjoy rimworld loop hero clan folk then youre going to love this game highly recommend

#####

its fun but its far too slow paced for a roguelite game

#####

the problem with dotage is that is completely snowballs out of control 
imagine civ but any mayor event can just kill your run if you waltz through the game its good fun if you fail just one challange which are mostly chancebased depending on your investment you could as well restart

in my 4h playthrough i lost a single winter event on a coin flip because i didnt have enough heat
so the game permanently froze half my population which i couldnt unfreeze as i obviously didnt have enough of the heat generating buildings that can do that 
but no worries 
in 5 days time there was another winter event for which i couldnt even prepare in the slightest freezing the remainder of my population 

i hate this design philosophy 
its so toxic makes me feel like the game hates me for playing it and wants me to waste my time


#####

please give this game a chance

#####

close to being good runs are drawn out far more than they should be as are unlocks the first run will have the least content which is a shame since replayability is fairly low i did one run and do not plan to play this game again

#####

just finished my first game got a perfect victory at least on normal difficulty the game seems to be very easy with not a lot of randomness still a recommend though as it is quite relaxing

#####

закончил свой первый ран длиною в 15 часов отлетев прямо перед апокалипсисом последней главой думаю ладно проиграл и проиграл надо пойти поспать может и тут метапрогрессия игры выдает мне нового старейшину ну я человек простой мне подвозят новые механики я их иду тестить зашел на буквально посмотреть очнулся через 7 часов 10 ну еще один ход из 10

#####

tldr this is not a useful review go read others ddd because i am to lazy

i wont refund game but i am to lazy to play it  its a good addictive game but ima go watch someone play it instead though i am just to lazy maybe ill give it a go again some other day

pros you can play with one hand if you know what im saying 

#####

fun

#####

fun game but screen tearing issues on mac

#####

too slow paced and repetitive doesnt help that its incredibly easy so nothing bad ever happens and optimisation is pointless i had a try at starting again on 200 difficulty but its just too slow they should really up the default difficulty by a lot

i like the graphics and the minimal story though and the overall idea behind the mechanics is sound

#####

dotage is not your everyday city builder game set against a backdrop of a looming apocalypse it offers a unique blend of strategic planning complex colony management and a narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat as the elder of a quaint village youre tasked with leading your villagers endearingly referred to as pips to a safe haven forging a new destiny amidst despair

the games art style is captivating with a charm that belies the harsh survival conditions you are thrown into despite its merciless tag dotage is surprisingly accessible its turnbased gameplay allows for thoughtful decisionmaking making every choice feel significant as you work against the ticking doomsday clock the colony management mechanics are deep yet intuitive reminiscent of classic strategy games but with a modern roguelike twist

what sets dotage apart is its strategic depth borrowing elements from workerplacement board games which adds layers to the citybuilding core mechanics each game session feels like a new story being unfolded thanks to the roguelite elements that keep the experience fresh and engaging

dotage has already garnered a very positive rating on steam and its easy to see why its charming aesthetics coupled with a compelling storyline and challenging yet rewarding gameplay make dotage a standout title in the citybuilding genre this game is a testament to the magic that can happen when indie developers think outside the conventional box offering a fresh perspective in a welltrodden genre
