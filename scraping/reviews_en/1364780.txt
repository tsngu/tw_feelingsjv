due to some nerve damage my left hand legit doesnt move fast enough to do most fighting game inputs but with the modern control scheme sf6 offers i can not only play but iwin against online playersi for the first time its like skipping straight past the entry barrier of learning inputs and getting straight on to learning fundamentals ive heard all sorts of discourse about modern controls and how it breaks the meta if people can instantly input this or that but im having a lot of fun thanks to it

#####

i dont understand what force in this game has convinced me that i a middleaged man with a good career and reasonably satisfying personal life need to come home from work every day and study which of jamies normals are plus on block after drive rush drill antiairs and grind to master but here we are

street fighter 6 is not only capcom getting back in the saddle as part of the pantheon of fighting games makers its an evolution of the genre as a whole

if you have even the slightest interest in fighting games this is a must buy the game is bursting with beginner friendly tutorials that can either be simple instructions or deep precise dives into frames and advantage states and such including a deep selection of tutorials and challenges for each character to help you fully grasp them each character feels distinct too they may have overlapping general niche roles but nobody feels surplus or padded manon and zangief may be both grapplers but manons slow build momentum focus is a world apart from big zs brutal command grab heavy arsenal of unrelenting high risk high reward offense

multiplayer is smooth and easy able to be accessed from both the fantastic hub world full of fun details or just from the main menu if you want to jump right in and provides plenty of chances to learn your way up the rankings before being thrown in with the pros

the option to switch between classic and modern controls is great as well modern in no way feels like easy mode or some crutch either you sacrifice complexity for ease and its up to you to decide if easier supers and combos is worth losing some of the granularity of full control over your characters inputs there is no right or wrong control system and youll be matched with both types online its a preference issue rather than anything else

singleplayer is equally well thought out though arcade mode gives nice simple fights to explore a character and good story rewards but the real star is its massive world tour mode where you make your own avatar to travel the world of street fighter meeting mentors and learning their styles the overall story is fairly bland but the real draw is getting to find chunli in chinatown and get her to train you and building a relationship with her as a mentor to the point where youre texting with her randomly in the world and learning about what shes been up to since the past games as well as mastering her iconic moves

thats a detail that seems to go overlooked at times this is the first sf game in ages to move the story forward chunli ryu ken theyve all progressed as characters and have experiences to share instead of being the same rather flat characters weve seen for decades at this point it feels like a proper passing of the torch in some ways too theres likely to never be a sf game without the core cast like ryu but the story lets the new blood feel like genuine up and coming street fighters to watch out for rather than just random additions

this is the street fighter most of us have been waiting ages for and if you have even a passing interest in fighting games this is going to be a fantastic one to learn on

#####

bro imagine releasing a finished game in 2023

#####

wow look at all these cool new characters picks ryu

#####

11 hours in and my record online is 134 very fun

#####

a dude looked at you funny punch him some guy is chilling by the river kick him in a girl has a cute outfit on divekick her from across the street bought pizza at a food truck uppercut the staff violence is never the answer it is in fact the question and the answer is yes

#####

game feels great runs excellent despite denuvo and the character creator is nothing short of superb

cant wait to never win a single match online

#####

add dudley you cowards

#####

it does that thing where it has a little musical note icon and then tells you the name of the song playing

for those unaware this is a mark of masterful game design

#####

im going to start this off with the preface ive not really really played many fighting games mostly because i have a handeye coordination disability that normally makes playing fighting games at a decent level impossible for me so when coming into street fighter 6 though i had heard nothing but good reviews i expected to play maybe an hour and end up refunding it because i once again would be terrible let me just say this is first fighting game ever with incredible accessibility options that has allowed me to play hours of this game and feel like im doing reasonably well

from the new modern controls to the world tour teaching me how certain characters work piece meal this is the most accessible fighting game ever made to date and i recommend it to anyone especially those who have avoided this genre because of personal limitations

in closing i want to say street fighter 6 is in my opinion the best fighting game ever made

#####

you can uppercut a lv 1 grandpa for no reason then proceed to send his ass to the er free of charge

#####

my wife said if this review gets 100 likes i can name our son ryu

#####

did one combo after 2 hours practice

#####

i love the fighting in this game i want to improve and have fun with the game but the real money aspect of the game just puts me off so much

i hate how theyve monetised this game just let me buy the characters and costumes straight up without having to pay the scam currency first

this game convinced me that it should be illegal to have an ingame currency that can only be bought with real money because they are being so incredibly greedy with this game to buy the costumes you have to buy 2 stacks of the scam currency to obtain 1 costume to add insult to injury this scam currency you are buying it only lasts 180 days

so not only are they forcing you to buy too much currency if you want a costume they are putting a short expiration date on it so that youll feel forced to buy even more crap to make the numbers even out

i hate the modern game world

#####

i got my ass kicked by a refrigerator

#####

crossplay perfect netcode perfect matchmaking system that lets you queue in both ranked and casual at once

and the game is good too

#####

finally let you actually fight in these streets

#####

as a core product street fighter 6 is a triumph  capcom took years of feedback about what did and didnt work through the street fighter 5 era listened and adapted  the product is polished to a mirror sheen  as a fighting game the systems are really well thought out work together and provide for a fantastic fighting experience that can be picked up easily enough but have significant depth to them   the roster is diverse reasonably sized and has enough variety that you can find someone that youll like playing  the newcomers in particular landed incredibly well with designs like marisa manon and kimberly being instantly iconic and full of personality  the online experience critical for a modern day fighting title is also superb with fantastic rollback netcode plenty of features a sensibly balanced ranked ladder good matchmaking and quick load times  its easy to load up sf6 play a bunch of online rounds and feel like you got a great gaming experience

capcom also did a very savvy thing centering the experience around two overlapping tentpoles world tour mode and modern controls  world tour is effectively what a big budget beatemup would look like in the modern era  roaming around some open world maps getting into fights getting money and experience and cosmetics to dress up your extremely customizable and potentially grotesquely deformed avatar  all the while youre interacting with the sf6 roster learning their styles mixing and matching moves and getting to know them as characters outside of the fighting arena  its part extended mechanics tutorial part street brawl and really quite a lot of fun  it also plays extremely well with modern controls which is a fully usable control scheme that cuts the execution requirements from the traditional 6 button technical input scheme to a four button version that includes some simple autocombos and onebutton specials  while purists might get snobby about it modern does exactly what it sets out to do  lets less experienced players be competitive in versus matches and shift the focus from technical control inputs to the more important strategic layer of movement positioning traps and mindgames which is where fighting games shine

all this said sf6 is being tremendously let down and hurt by some very questionable ongoing development and business decisions  the game itself outside of the traditional season pass dlc characters we have so far two of them released two announced has been stagnating in a way that some of its contemporaries are not capcom has elected to go with an annual balance patch which means the meta hasnt really shifted since launch and characters with glaring weaknesses in their kit remain undertuned and underrepresented  ongoing content releases have mostly been focused on avatar cosmetics and other items that cant be used or show up outside of gimmick avatar battles  most of these come through the nowobligatory premium battlepasses while the paid tracks ultimately can be selfsustaining if you play enough matches they cycle extremely quickly and turn sf6 into the grindy type of live service experience  capcom also has gotten into using predatory micro and macrotransaction practices using a combination of secondary mobilestyle currencies sold in bundles that never quite fit right of course and extremely overpriced premium cosmetics fifteen dollar tmnt costumes anyone  fifteen dollars per turtle that is  this culminated in the long awaited outfit 3 release with new costumes for the whole roster  a breath of fresh air for a stagnating visual experience marred by the costumes being expensive six dollars each not available in any sort of bulk bundle and only available using capcoms secondary currency  there is no world in which it can be considered justifiable to have to pay over 100 dollars for a rosterwide single outfit update even if they were available ala carte and are very high quality designs

so sf6  i do recommend it if you like or want to like fighting games because its really a great 2d fighter that said if you are sensitive to or put off by some of the gaming industrys worst practices theyre showing up in full force here and theres no real indication that capcom is listening to player feedback on the subject  its certainly killed a lot of my drive to follow and play the game on an ongoing fashion and i have to note it as a real black eye on the experience

#####

one of the most accessible traditional fighting games to date and one of the best games of year 2023

h2starting from zero  here comes a new challengerh2

for newcomers to the genre the singleplayer world tour mode is a 30 to 60 hour open world rpg story campaign which takes the players custom character through a couple of citysized locales along the way players will meet up with various street fighter characters as questgiving masters and get to mixandmatch special moves belonging to the said masters player appearances are highly customizable through the character creator and there is a decent amount of clothing items accessories to be earned ingame each with their own colour variants 

exploration is fully 3d combat is done through an instant switch to a 2d side scrolling perspective akin to an actual 2d fighter gameplay loop consists of levelling up your main character upgrading gear and stats completing questssidequestsmaster tasks content is largely serviceable but does serve as a smooth if slow onboarding experience to players unfamiliar with the genre

writing can be charming for fans of the franchise often making references to the cast and events of past iterations the main plot however does fall flat and lead to an inconclusive finale that will leave most players bewildered

h2back to arcade editionh2

there is a separate standalone standard 5fight  12fight arcade mode against increasingly challenging cpu opponents each playable character comes with their own intro scenes and arcade mode ending sequences there is also a decent amount of unlockable artwork for repeated runs through the arcade mode

h2bringing in the modern  the new generationh2

one of the most revolutionary changes in street fighter 6 involves the introduction of a new control scheme  the modern controls 

with this optional input method gone are the legacy quartercircle halfcircle dragon punch motions and the series reliance on precisely timed linked combo sequences where players have to properly time each successive attack in a combo sequence

modern controls are based around the following contextually designed buttons

light attack  short range normal attacks that are fast to execute quick to recover but deal low damage rapidly hitting this button will allow the player to string a predesigned combo that leaves them relatively safe from the opponent

medium attack  mid range attacks more suited for distanced fighting these are the jack of all trades of normal moves and usually the goto button in most bouts

heavy attack  high damage andor long range moves that are slow to execute and also slow to recover these would be for long ranged engagements or for landing guaranteed combos to capitalize on particularly glaring opponent mistakes such as missing an uppercut which leaves them extremely vulnerable to huge attacks as they helplessly float their way down from the sky

special attack  the star of the show traditional fireball motions involving a down downforward forward  punch has been simplified to just a press of the special attack button the perennially tricky uppercut motion forward down downforward   punch has been replaced with a generic forward  special button input for most characters that possess an antiair special move a significant downside comes in the form of a 20 damage penalty for moves performed using this shortcut

button mappings for auto attack modifier that uses more resources when held down in conjunction with pressing attack buttons throw drive impact and parry round up the remaining buttons that fit a standard gamepad

h2for the classically trained  champions of yesteryearh2

the full suite of classic 6button controls is still in effect for players familiar with the genre  with the entire arsenal of character moves and special attacks intact
a couple of sf6s mechanics are cribbed from select past iterations as follows

drive impact  a universal forward moving attack that can withstand and armour through 2 normal attacks of your opponent ending with them in a crumpled state and be susceptible to big damage combos land this while your opponent is near the corner and this move becomes an unblockable attack too extremely intuitive move to grasp and utilize to devastating effect even for beginners at a 26frame startup or 043seconds the most common counter would be to initiate your own drive impact within this narrow yet achievable reaction time window

drive parry  a dedicated avoid button that allows the player to negate damage without having to guess high or low or even leftright when blocking hitting parry at the exact point of impact even slows the game down and allows the defending player an opportunity to launch their own counterattack midmove the downside players committed to parrying will be stuck in the parry animation and be extremely vulnerable to throws to the point of suffering a solid 170 of throw damage

h2a fight for the future  world warriors and beyondh2

1v1 fighting is still the core of this game and its smooth online play delivers without compromise

ranked mode brings players into versus matches against opponents of the same skill level there is an understandable hesitation from newer players to head online with them assuming that ranked matches are only for the professional and serious players this is not the case
ranked modes are meant to match the players of similar skill level  new players will largely be matched against new players and they will have relatively close enjoyable matches when players focus on improving various aspects of their game plan execution reaction to jumpin attacks and drive impact attempts baiting the enemy into mistakes they will naturally advance up the ranks in this mode

battle hub is an explorable 3d lobby where most nonranked matches are held just find an empty station sit down and wait for somebody to challenge you to a match with unlimited rematch attempts players can also choose to spectate any of the occupied stations and observe the ongoing matches maybe even queue up to be the next in line to fight against the existing players 
also of note is the tournament mode held 23 times a week within the battle hub signups are open 1 hour before the tournament start time each tournament lobby can accommodate up to 32 players in a firstto2 single elimination format tournaments run for around 3040minutes with the route to grand finals just taking 5 consecutive matches at max this serves as a good warmup ground for players aspiring to attend actual offlineonline events within their real world location
there is also a rotating set of retro capcom arcade games such as captain commando puzzle fighter street fighter alpha 2 son son in case you want to take a breather from all the matches

a robust training mode with frame data prebuilt drills anti air scenario punish scenario combo trials character guides and a bevy of qualityoflife features round up the package

sincerely a satisfied customer of the game who has completed all steam achievements attained master rank online as e honda participated in multiple ingame tournaments and even won 1 and courageously took part in the regional offline and online premiere events of the capcom pro tour 2023 circuit

anticonsumer dlc practices capcom pls

with the brand new release of rashid we now know you cannot buy a single character outright you have to buy packs of ingame currency and the pricing structure is such that you have to buy more coins than a character costs 

rashid is going for 350 coins the lowest amount you can be is 250 coins for 5 so you have to pay 10 for 500c or 12 for 610c and have leftovers

typical scummy bullshit you would expect from a terrible mobile game capcom does not need to resort to such tactics to sell content for a game as popular as street fighter all this does is make people like me on the fence want to avoid spending  any additional money on anything to avoid supporting predatory and consumer unfriendly practices 

capcom knows exactly what theyre doing with these pricing structures and its super friggen scummy of them 

hopefully by the time they add characters i really want to buy in a few years things have changed i went from looking forward to future dlc characters to it being something i would never want to pay for and support because of this trash 

so thank you and eff you very much capcom please turn this nonsense around asap and let us buy single dlc characters outright with actual money

#####

street fighter back in its full glory after the disgrace that 5 was  in terms of mechanics its the least liked sf game in terms of pc port its the worst  street fighter 6 not only restored the glory of what the 4th generation was but surpasses it in many ways already with tremendous more space to to grow this is going to be a longer review so ill break it down as follows
 new player experience
 mechanics
 content
 monetization
 pc version

h1new player experienceh1
fighting games are hard that is the common view of them and street fighter was always among the more difficult there is no dialing up combos then watching them play out like mortal kombat  injustice you have to time all the unique moves after each other linking or cancelling into each other cancel in the right moment this requires either prior knowledge from previous games as experience between games carry over well or learning by experience or from various guides

street fighter 6 does everything to hold your hand there is a very long tutorial explaining how street fighter games work there is one that explains each and every new mechanics in sf6  there are actual descriptions that tell you this is how it works why it works that way how and when to do it at any point you can stop its ai demonstration any try it yourself then there are individual guides that go over nearly every move of every single fighter explaining everything in the above manner then there are the traditional combo trials for each character and an extremely indepth training mode where you can even display frame data of every move on the go on top of it all street fighter 6 introduces the worlds first open world exploration for a fighting game youll have 2 medium sized cities and almost a dozen smaller other areas around the world to visit in a purposefully sillywritten very early 90s style sort of jrpg with itemization and consumables too which is just a love letter to the fans of the characters as you get to see them live in their own world and as you keep doing missions and using their battle style even mix and matching special moves from all of them your bond increases with them which unlocks new moves they come to your aid in need tell you about their life stories and give you silly lovely little things like a concept art about how ryu got his first modern jacket from chun li because him wearing his gi all the time caused him problems on the airports its just heartwarming extra for us long time fans and a very smooth introduction and casual fun for new players the story is all kinds of goofy wonky silly fun but it puts a smile on my face way more often than expected and im teaching ryu how to use a smartphone as if he is my grandpa while he teaches me how to break ribs

there is a new modern control scheme that transforms sf from a 6 button game to a 4 button game making it so much more easier for absolutely newbies to enjoy the game however you should quickly drop this for classics or otherwise youll miss out on certain moves and will suffer a permanent 20 damage nerf as long as you use modern controls also there is an auto control scheme for those who just want to mash buttons and the ai helps you to autocreate combos  this is banned from online and there is no way to allow it thank god

h1mechanicsh1
the new drive system allows you to cancel any normal move on hitblock into a forward dash gaining frame advantage and making normally impossible combos now connect for this youll use a drive meter which constantly regenerates but doing ex moves also consumes this parrying also consumes this and blocking also slowly eats it up the whole match is about managing this meter as an extra layer of strategy on top of the already bottomless depth of mindgames present in any street fighter should you empty your bar youll enter burnout state when you are a bit slower you start to take minimal damage even on block and you guessed it it reloads faster if you go on an offense however if you entered burnout you cannot use any of your drive features until it regenerated back to full its a quite fantastic system that carries the best elements of sf4s focus attack dash cancel system there is a focus attack that consumes 2 hits now but only breaks defense if it pushes you to a wall and 3rd strikes parry 

h1content  onlineh1
 there are 18 fighters in the base game with more coming
 battlehub online space  lobby in an arcade building to socialize and look for opponents and friends fight with your custom avatars or play classic matches also several 90s capcom games are available on solo arcade machines

 extreme modes for those who want to go 0100 silly real fast rolling barrels or shocking tesla coils dropping from the sky or a bull charging through the stage  you have many modifiers to have fun with
 online netcode is perhaps the best of any fighting game i ever played sf4 5 mk9 mkx injustice 2 sf6 there is a separate indicator of connection for those who play on wifi
 arcade mode for so many additional unlockables
 titles are unlocked by challanges and character kudos you earn with trials watching guides tutorials and playing online

h1monetizationh1
 alternative colors are bought with ingame money earnable through challanges
 alternative costumes are unlocked through max bond with characters in campaign or alternatively 1 per costume
 there is a premium currency for buying alternative costumes 50  costume smallest pack is 5 for 250 premium currency
 dlc characters are bought either in seasons 4 packs or individually with premium currency none released yet
 battlepass the best battlepass ever made this is a battlepass made for the shareholders and investors who told the devs they must do it devs said ok and made trash cosmetics for your avatar and some titles all of the real game is uneffected no character skins etc

h1pc versionh1
 all platform crossplay
 full steam integration for achievements guides dlc etc
 rock solid 60 fps for all classic modes
 campaign open world is worse than some ps2 spider man games at times and runs terribly campaign battles may run in slow motion regardless of graphic settings  fps in case that happens you need to lock campaign battles to 30 fps there is a separate setting for this in options which is still a poor experience but you can get used to it or just ignore the campaign like everyone
 fps drops happen in introoutro videos of characters but does not effect match start
 full keyboard support every button you can use as many as you want like in 4 to hell with you sf5 pc port
 easy plug and play support for x360  x1 controllers did not try others
 demo available
 bencmark available separate download from official site

as a veteran of street fighter 4 from release to the end of ultra edition sinking 4000 hours into it from games for windows live times to full steam integration across 8 years i very much disliked sf5 its battle system poor pc port regarding keyboard support laughable netcode and plasticdoll effect graphics style street fighter 6 is everything i wanted 4 to grow and evolve into its a masterpiece that puts back street fighter on the throne of all fighting game tournaments with at least 57 years of support coming i dont ever buy full priced games anymore but this is the one exception i made and i have no regrets however you should avoid the bigger editions for now and wait for price drop on dlc characters

#####

great fighting im saying this as a newbie
good online connections im saying this as a beginner
terrible confusing menus im saying this as someone with eyes

#####

cammy has an amazing ass

#####

as someone whos never been into the fighting game genre this is a great start is very beginner friendly

#####

sakura when

#####

how to play cammy



first have your both hands on the controller

#####

the game is alright but the use of predatory monetisation and microtransactions in a game that is already fullprice is frankly unacceptable

#####

aint often nowadays you get a game thats worth the release price tag  

this is one of them though

#####

they did it they made street fighter fun again and it has the most solid online netcode ever it feels great to play even against a 400 ping guy and my inputs are working just fine they goddamn did it

#####

seems like theres a problem with the timing of launch
at launch fighting ground and world tour is unavailable because it cannot be downloaded since it assume that the app shouldnt be available yet
but seems like people already rushes to gave negative review instead of waiting around 3045 min

world tour review  for casual player

highly recommended for those who want to learn playing fighting game although you need to keep your expectation fair since of course this only training you to fight cpu up to lv 67

capcom dev team isnt lying when they said wt is for training people to handle real situation subtly some minigames train you for positioning handling charge command quick input button etc
world tour plays pretty much like yakuza series but the condition for completion or acquiring item is fighting is related eg do reversal x times
and those will help you to recognize the exact moment to use it in fight against ai or real player

if you are inexperienced in fighting playing in modern control is also possible and it seems like for now in the early days theres quite a number of player with modern control in battle hub

once you get used to fighting in wt you might want to go to training ground to find your main the character guide is really helpful imo and maybe try some combo trials

the endgame is of course the ranked match or the battle hub at least i kinda enjoy fighting numerous meta one piece character in avatar battle using my average waifu build character
win or lose hopefully you can learn something about yourself just like ryu said the answer lies in the heart of the internet yes he did said that

#####

capcom is just going on a win streak monster hunter rise resident evil 4 remake and now street fighter 6 absolutely based

#####

i got my butt kicked by some girls bare feet

#####

maybe it is still a honeymoon phase which happens to pretty any fresh fighting game but it is definitely very fun street fighter with a potential to shine and evolve as a fantastic one

footsies which sf is well known for feels amazing every poke seems convenient to use solid emphasis on punish game interesting mechanics which give a lot of variety and sometimes it feels overwhelming in a good way you rarely have a feeling that there is no way to outplay your opponent drive gauge gives unexpected layers of complexity and interesting resource management which ive never seen in any sf game drive tools are strong at first but usually have various counterplays to them eg drive impact can be countered by drive impact on reaction parry throws or three fast hits roster is also robust with matchups which do not feel the same especially it is the case with jp and marisa newcomers give a lot of sauce to the game and the old characters have been mostly reworked with new tools dee jay is one of the most impressive legacy character rework ive ever seen in the genre the only gameplay related thing which did not impress me that much  drive reversal seems limited to a few situations although there is a possibility that i did not just get used to how it can be used properly

capcom learnt by their mistakes and they made full package for a release sf6 is not restricted to the core game training game arcade and online it also has party gameish extreme battle mode and lengthy single player campaign there are also a lot of great qol features such as instant rematch good ingame character guides tons of options in practice mode and frame meter it is so good that its even used outside of sf6 before its release

there are some aspects of the game which are not all that great though world tour is the worst mode of the game  great idea with really weak implementation it is intriguing at first but it gets really tedious and grindy sometimes i would enjoy this mode way more with less bullet sponges grind and unnecessary extra steps in quests music is also a controversial aspect of the game  i personally enjoy it more than not fete foraine and jamies themes are wonderful but there are also a lot of bland themes too unfortunately also there are hiccups with matchmaking and its restrictions to the region but it is addressed by devs it is still not a problem with playing online sets via battle hub and regular lobby especially with such good netcode ive rarely seen noticeable rollbacks and it was pretty convenient to play with 180 ms ping 

denuvo which is expected for a new capcom game and battle pass can be understandable turn off for some players but it is not the end of the world i feel that the flaws are not that crucial and sf6 is mostly done right it feels that devs do care for the game there was no such feeling with the former instalment on launch

amazing game without any doubt if you waited for an opportunity to play street fighter good ground based game or you want a well crafted mainstream fighting game finally  street fighter 6 is a great opportunity

i like punching homeless people on the streets

kick punch its all in the mind

#####

as someone has zero fighting game experience and was once intimidated by the skill barrier of the genre i preordered this game because the graphics  art style was good which makes me willing to give the genre a try i wouldve never imagined that half year later i am a master rank player i enjoy putting effort into the training room and seeing myself getting better and the feeling that my effort sweat no tears as for now were compensated when i lose i have no one else to blame when i win its because im better i love that i also bought some other fighting games since like kof and mk soon tekken but this is where all started

#####

#####

this comment wont get noticed so im gonna just say that im loving every bit about being a street fighter fan right now

#####

tldr  game itself 1010 but pure evil predatory practices 

i love technical games i played from souls games to rhythm games but ive always avoided fighting games due to how much study is required to approach them when sf6 came out though i decided that it was the moment to finally try this world i like playing per se but i value narrative more so the expectations of my engagement werent very high oh boy i was wrong the journey of getting stronger fight after fight learning from others and my mistakes reignited my gamer core that now that ive a lot of games behind my back is getting more and more selective but sf6 set it ablaze once more also i would like to say that you dont have to study an abnormal amount of time before playing just get in there and have fun the technicalities and the will to learn them will come to you not the other way around 

but just as well as i was shocked about how much im loving the game i had no idea about the terrible conditions the entire fighting game industry is in not just sf6 basically anything malicious that exists is present not every element is applicable to sf6 but almost all of them are 
microtransactions
multiple ingame currencies
normal and premium season pass
paywalls for extra characters 
lowest currency bundle is not enough to buy 1 character the higher one leaves you with a considerable amount of leftover but not enough to buy another character
paywallschores for skinscolors
rotating stores
separate dlcs often too many
basically all the worst practices of gamesasservices but the base game is still at full price 

sf6 core is marvellous but i wont praise it if its surrounded by this shameful mess

#####

sick open world mode
sick combat
thick thighs

#####

edit i failed to express that i love the game but please consider that as i want monetization to change voting with my wallet is not enough i need to be vocal about it by leaving a negative review

horrendous monetization coming from scammy mobile games the most frustrating example is that 8 characters equal to 2800 fighter coins but you can only pay for 2750fc as maximum and 250fc as minimum

also if you use the calculator its cheaper to pay for characters individually than paying the season pass here is the math

fc  fighter coin paid currency
350fc per character  4 character in the season pass  1400fc
packs
 250fc  5
 610fc  12
 1250fc  24
 2750fc  50

season pass  30 
1250fc  250fc  29 

so you pay 1 less and get 100fc more but you lose colors that can be obtained for free

#####

im a 50yearold gaming dad and i have loved playing this game with my two sons

#####

everything works fine people are just braindead and have no patience if you cant access content there is a small patch wait for it to install

update 4th day the game is amazing so much content to play with the online netcode is amazing played with someone on 1bar wifi with 250 ping and it was very smooth youll still find people with really bad internet but thats just how it goes

the characters are super fun and hits are also very satisfying

#####

juris feet

#####

game is actually really god damn good every character feels unique and cammy ass is so big

#####

the game is good but the way they use monetization and microtransactions in a game that is already full price is a bit over the top

six months in at the time of this writing and heres my thoughts

pros
 infinitely better netcode than sfv at launch
 world tour mode is a fun distraction and a nice addition to the final fightstreet fighter lore
 battle hub is a good spin on the feeling of going to the arcade and sitting down at a cabinet
 training mode is definitely useful for both old and new players alike
 finding matches is quick and easy with minimal downtime

cons
 forced playthrough of world tour to unlock costumes is a grind and a half if you dont want to open that wallet
 they seem really intent on trying to cram modern controls down your throat in wt even if you want to stick with classic mode
 six months in and were just now getting outfit 3 for the characters
 capcom corporate seems to be intent on shoveling in every bit of microtransactions they can on the avatar side of things and collaboration costumes have been exorbitantly priced if they want the fans to spend give us more costumes for the regular characters
 slow rollout of additional characters is a bit of a drag

overall though the game is a worthy successor to the street fighter lineage and very newbie friendly worth picking up if youre just getting into fighting games or if youre an old pro

#####

a long awaited return to form

capcoms fighting games division needed a win and what they delivered is way beyond that street fighter 6 is an awesome fighting game

youll find content catered for you no matter what type of gamer you are casuals can hit the streets in world tour mode learn the ropes through fun activities minigames and mild rpg elements you create an avatar and customize its appearance then later learn special moves from the street fighter characters masters and create your own style of fighter

when youre done and ready to learn proper street fighter you can go to the fighting grounds where youll find all the main sf stuff vs mode team battle practice combo training etc

the character roster is fantastic you get the original world warriors then you have some others sprinkled from different sf games each characters design was very well thought out classic characters show some age since the story line has advanced in the first time since 3rd strike while new faces like luke jamie and kimberly add a younger vibe to the mix the amount of personality these characters were given is crazy good youll find a hard time hating any of them lots of details were given to each even winning a perfect round theyre given a special win pose theres so much to seek out in terms of design personality and gameplay concepts 

speaking of gameplay

the main mechanics are very well thought out the drive system is fantastic drive impact drive reversal drive parry od moves drive rush are all very fun to use and all have ways to counter something youll have to learn as you play as utilizing them properly is key to your survival over time youll find yourself using them correctly and improve your overall skill always remember there is a counter to every mechanic in the game you have to learn how to react and correctly punish mistakes drive impact  drive rush both can be properly punished 

modern controls is basically a new control scheme you get light medium heavy and special buttons which make attacking easier to grasp for beginners special moves can be done with a single press of the special button along with a direction doing special moves that way incurs a damage penalty which allow for faster reactions its also viable for high level play if you do invest time in learning it but its optional 

you can always use the classic controls 6button layout if you prefer and play street fighter like you always used to 

theres also dynamic controls which is basically made for casuals to mash buttons and have fun at gatherings and notsoserious party play

take those skills further and go online with the battle hub feature which takes your avatar to a virtual arcade where you can meet other players and challenge them to fights you can also play some classic capcom arcade games and capcom will rotate the games from time to time

now the true improvement and paradigm shift is the online experience the netcode has been awesome since day 1 it has crossplay you can play against anyone on pc ps5 or even xbox rollback netcode was implemented properly allowing you to play with players further away than what we used to be able to play compared to older sf games and even compared to other fighting games its awesome you can actually enjoy playing ranked matches and learn

master rank is where your skill is truly put to the test where you will be matched with high level players youll need to really work hard for your win and its really satisfying because the netcode allows you to properly play with more regions and expose yourself to playstyles beyond what youre familiar with at locals

the visuals are fantastic characters look great animations are fluid and attention to detail can be seen everywhere audio is great too voice acting in both en and jp are very well done music is subject to your taste i like most of it so it doesnt bother me

the game runs great on a multitude of devices including the steam deck and rog ally perfect for labbing in training mode while on the go

all in all i believe this game is one ofif not the best games you can buy these days a product truly made with love mechanics were thought out very well high level play is extremely satisfying online is so good its very addictive 

it is easily my game of the year and one of the best games ive ever played

highly recommended

for the past few years the fighting games have been living in this bubble where they cost 60 bucks and offer very little value to the common player

personally i dont mind paying for that kinda experience because i always loved playing and learning fighting games with that said its a really tough sell for those who have never playedhave little experience with fighting games

its a commitment that i dont think many people are willing to make especially when there are other competitive games that cost virtually 0

street fighter 6 is a wake up call to fighting games it offers very solid content for both competitive and casual audiences alike in a way that feels worth the price tag

starting from a competitive side of things  just like any other street fighter game sf6 its a more grounded fighting game focusing on controlling space and finding the right opportunity to attack with that said sf6 shakes things up a bit with this new bar called drive gauge

this new drive gauge bar will be your key to break into your opponents defense giving access to tools such as parries armored moves ect although a very powerful tool the drive gauge its also a double edge sword if you are too aggressive  you risk losing it and enter  burnout state  where your character gets debuffs in the same way if you are being too defensive you can also lose that drive gauge as well

its a very interesting design choice it rewards both defensive and aggressive playstyle in a way that youre required to have both to be successful in this game

obviously i couldnt mention sf6 without talking about world tour mode if playing online isnt much your thing the world tour will be mode for you basically it takes this story driven open world adventure sorta like like an rpg you will be fighting random npcs on the street getting xp learning new moves 
while not super deep its a fantastic way to learn the game without being overwhelmed by online play

its a really nice package i totally recommend it even if you dont want to get super into the competitive aspect of it

its a fun game its definitely a new standard for fighting games play it 

b small note on pc version performance b  the game is beautifully optimised on pc as you expect from a re engine game but ive noticed the world tour mode runs significantly worse than regular battles i assume it has to do with vram usage i recommend lower the texture quality


#####

very fun and beginner friendly fighting game easy to learn hard to master

#####

bedited 222024b so forty hours later having put much more time into every aspect of the game my opinions of the game as a whole have become much lower than when i started out what i said below stands  the games accessibility qol and design as a fighter feel like a new bar theyre incredible most of the new fighters are fantastic its a great game where it matters as a fighting game

the rest of the game is comically terrible take world tour a grindy unfinished mess of a story mode with production values that genuinely feel like sonic 06 a mode where when you fail sidequests you have to talk to the npc again and skip through fifteen lines of dialogue just to give them another attempt a mode where outside of the starting area of metro city every masters area is a tiny room with three npcs

or take battle hub the second of the three major modes nobody plays battle hub anymore the game released barely over half a year ago and it already feels vestigial and why wouldnt it why on earth would you play battle hub over matchmaking when matchmaking can be done while playing any other mode has more features and is ten thousand times faster to just play the game

well its obvious why which is capcom execs and shareholders clearly seeing dollar signs at mobile games and genshins capcom seems to have worked backwards from creating things for the battle passes and currencies and other bloated junk so they landed on avatars and avatar items and battle hub aka street fighter playstation home and world tour halfbaked unfinished rpg mode were stapled on to support it its a game built around exploiting you and mugging you for your money

i cant speak enough to how stupid yes stupid these decisions are street fighter is not a mobile game the model of selling you new pngs doesnt work because characters in fighting game take months if not years of development and a lot of money you cant normally fight with the avatars they arent visible in matchmaking and the cost of all this is a game that feels cheaply made and nakedly exploitative where it seems like it is trying to piss you off and you cant even impulse buy anything by design

its frustrating to imagine the amount of additional polish the fighting game in this fighting game could have had if so much time and money wasnt wasted on cruft why is there no music player or customizer why do characters only have two round intros and one set of far too long nonrandomized victory lines even though recording more lines would have been easy hell why is there so little music variety i had to mod marisas theme because i was sick of hearing her repetitive monday night football music a hundred times in a row

this game is a fantastic fighting game stapled onto a complete joke unless youre confident you will enjoy playing online dont bother at all



im completely astonished at how much i enjoyed this game once i finally bit the bullet and got it like i knew i would eventually i was not at all expecting it to complete overtake every fighting game ive ever played as my favorite of all time but somehow they actually did it i like it more than sf3 mvc2 and mvc3 even gg strive and im shocked to compare it favorably to any of those its just that good

i could go on and on about why from the incredible leap forwards in accessibility and qol the genius game design that subtly teaches you the actual fundamentals of fighting games just by playing it the fantastic tutorials that teach you the best way to play every individual character and the equally fantastic training mode that lets you instantly set up practice scenarios against the opponent who was spding you with zangief on wakeup fifteen times a round its fun to learn and fun to play and easier to get into than any fighting game in history has ever been

but i still cant recommend it because the scummy underhanded business practices are so awful even for cap street fighter ii turbo hd remix ultimate edition com that theyre still jawdropping ive enjoyed the game so much that i thought about picking up rashid well sorry unlike every fighting game with dlc i cant just get rashid i have to buy street fighter funbuckz rashid costs 350 funbuckz and the lowest denomination is 250 oh well ill get the next highest denomination and get aki too haha sorry the next highest is 610 well fine ill get a costume for marisa how much is 610 funbuckz its 13 13 for one character and a costume i can unlock by playing the game

or if i was an insane person with no comprehension of money i can get the character pass for 30 to get rashid and three characters ill probably barely play

meanwhile the game is pushing rashid on me everywhere since there are rental tickets that let you use dlc characters for an hour how generous and he even shows up in the single player arcade mode regardless of whether you have him or not and dont think you can play dlc characters or this game at all with a friend through steam remote play or anything because they disabled that yes they disabled remote local multiplayer for a two player fighting game 

i ended up spending nothing at all and being reminded of why i didnt want to buy this in the first place fire your accountants capcom

despicable monetization

#####

h1prefaceh1
as much as i hated sf5s launch and lifespan street fighter 6 has brought the sf series to a whole new level i despised the days when capcom started releasing 56 versions of the game with characters locked behind the paywall unfortunately i can see sf6 doing the same already and its somewhat become a norm in the fgc to do this for the past several years its one of those lovehate relationships that we have on one hand we hate the entire gaming industry for such scummy practices on the other we see it as a way to support our favorite fighting games by throwing our money at these companies whatever controversial take there may be to each his own

i will admit however that i am guilty as charged for having a double standard against certain companies for monetization practices fortunate or unfortunate i go easier on fighting games for some reason

h1positivesh1
bmechanicsb
sa drive impactparry rushdown  this is street fighter in its prime the smoothness and flow of combat is what defines a fighting game new fighting game mechanics are always hit or miss there is no inbetween and capcom took a risk worth taking with the drive gauge its not too overwhelming and it definitely is a gamechanger in many cases based on my 50orso casual matches that i had with a friend i consider an eternal rival in every fighting game we get our hands on

bcontentb
one of the biggest controversies that sf5 faced in its early days was the abysmal lack of content that it suffered from on launch day glad to see sf6 does not face the same issue here with world tour mode being in the spotlight to attract newer players to the franchise with its beginnerfriendly and adventuregame like elements which are always welcome additions to the generally hardcore nature of fighting games other than that sf6 on launch comes with other modes that a solid fighting game should have the extreme battles were also a surprising addition to the fray offering a variety of different battle conditions should you find yourself bored with the normal ko fights

h1negativesh1
bmonetization  paywallsb
as i mentioned before i can see the many different versions of sf6 being released over the next few years as more characters and content is released prepare for sf6 arcade edition sf6 ultra edition and sf6 preparetokillyourwallets edition by 2030

bno custom rooms yetb
the hub is pretty amazing in and of itself but i was utterly disappointed when my friend and i were unable to create custom rooms lolwut

h1conclusionh1
bfinal verdict sb
in its current base form street fighter 6 has brought the franchise to new heights with relatively enjoyable new mechanics a solid world tour mode with a fantastic customization options for cac and smootherthanever combat just waiting to see how greedy capcom gets with this game its gonna be milkable af thats for sure

im not sure how ill rate the game going forward and not a fan of early reviews however the game has a confusing and unfortunate amount of monetary schemes that as far as i can tell havent been covered in game reviews im just trying to offer a fair warning for people that might be bothered by them as i am

for one the game has a battle pass with a premium version to be worked in later no specifics beyond that but inevitably charging for battle pass antics in a 60 game is poor form theres also rental fighter passes that allow you to test an unowned character for a whopping hour with other games just periodically swapping fighters out this seems like a limited and rather poor way to allow players to see what other characters are about

the next thing confuses me a bit paid currency has an expiration date in japan i guess its not a problem if it doesnt affect the rest of the world maybe ive got to reread the blurb when i get an opportunity theres also advertisements on the battle hub banners which is nice

finally as far as i can see you can only get drive tickets from challenges there are daily weekly and monthly challenges that offer kudos which give you titles for the characters you use and drive tickets currently only the monthly one offers drive tickets at 500 per successful challenge the cheapest shop items cost 2000 at that rate you can get one cheap shop item every four months unless you spend cash

overall im not trying to tell anyone how to feel about all this im just trying to inform people so they can make their own decisions about them some of these elements may change over time but the fact that ive seen them in no reviews only reading destructoids and igns and dont recall any of these things in the demo or the open beta suggests that they were snuck in at least world tour  for now  seems free of all this malarkey though it has weird performance issues on the steam deck  some fights run smooth enough some play out in slow motion with no evidence of framerate hitching involved its been fun otherwise for the hour and change ive played it

edit destructoids review actually covers some if not all of this my tired brain just forgot igns review makes zero mention of this  that i saw anyway

#####

great game to start if youre totally brand new to fighting games

#####

cammys ass













this game is pretty fun too

#####

sfv and 3rd strike had this baby

i beat my father with hadouken

#####

i typically dont instantly review a game but i feel like i need to fight some misinformation here
as of right now the game is very good just look at the glowing critic reviews it has gotten but concerning the dlc a lot of negative reviews seem to mention this is not an issue
just right click the game in your library go to dlc and check the box to download
this is actually a net positive as when youre done with or not interested in world tour mode you can untick it and save 17 gb on your hard drive this is a good thing its actually something i wish more competitive games would offer
fighting grounds which includes training mode is a 4 gb which should be done in minutes

edit hundreds of hours in this is indeed one of the best packages of a fighting game released at launch definitely in recent memories looking forward to the next 5 years of competitive landscape and coming characters its going to be a classic

#####

my girlfriend bough me this game at the beginning was very hard i come from tekken but after 10 hours i started to understand how to play a little
world tour mode is very funny
im waiting for sakura

#####

edit as a clarification i would like to say that the online fights have not had this problem for me but i was very excited for the single player campaign the performance issues have mainly persisted within world tour mode

the game drops to 20 fps or lower and just stays there until i restart the game i never had this problem in the betas so it can only be attributed to the addition of denuvo i will quote gabe newell about this forever
the easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work its by giving those people a service thats better than what theyre receiving from the pirates

antipiracy only ever hurts paying customers and you would hope capcom learned that with re8 but here we are many people are having no problems but many people are having this problem

#####

i cant stand 2d fighting games i really do hell over the years i fell off of fighting games hard ever since tekken 7 season 3 there hasnt been a singe fighting game or update to get me back into the genre 

even before the game was released i had no faith in capcom after the disaster that was street fighter v a terribly visually ugly looking game with no defensive options a sorry excuse of rollback netcode no single player content and laughably the worst story mode in all of fighting games i had zero hope for this game 

later on capcom revealed that the monster hunter team was working on the game and not yoshinori ono thank god trailer after trailer it looked like everything a modern fighting game was suppose to be whats this an open world single player in a fighting game for its main campaign full crossplay with all platforms amazing netcode an mmo like hub to interact with players to make the game feel more social good visuals good music swaggy new characters character guides for each character classic and new modern control scheme that isnt just mash buttons to win like stylish in guilty gear and other auto combo garbage in anime games actual defensive options theres no way it could all be true right

later on the open beta released and i played it for almost 18 hours thats the most time ive ever spent with a beta for a game period i could not put my stick down it was so much fun i cannot believe capcom delivered on everything with this game finally a fighting game where both the casuals and hardcore fgc can enjoy i even put over 25 hours in the world tour mode which is insane how much content that mode has on top of being a fun way for beginners to learn the mechanics of street fighter the battle hub is so refreshing and actually works so well compared to traditional lobbies and whatever the hell arcsys makes with their terrible lobby systems even on 3 bars 100ish ping it felt very playable compared to any delay based and early rollback netcode out there i was sold this is the game everyone needs this is the new aaa gaming standard for fighting games

i genuinely hope it stays that way for as long as capcom supports it i cant recommend this game enough
im so happy to say that street fighter 6 is easily the best 2d fighting game ive ever played

#####

came for cammys ass and juris feet stayed for modern controls and ranked matches

#####

just let me buy dlc characters directly or let me buy fighter coins in increments that match character cost
i shouldnt have to buy 10 worth of coins to buy a 7 character

#####

bring back el fuerte you cowards

#####

if this is your first street fighter title know its a marathon not a sprint you might feel at first your not doing so hot but take the time to practice and youll get there

#####

its been 20 years since i cared about street fighter or fighting games and wasnt a kid in arcades playing sf2 

this game is everything evo was beyond hype and that they lowered the barrier of entry added a 50 rpg fighting game rpg and raised the skill ceiling at the same timeyeah get this game its beyond fun and im just getting started 

see you at evo 2024 which will be a historically huge crowd because of mk1 and tekken 8 being new sf6 is the best fighting game of alltime

#####

they gave zangief jiggle physics 3

#####

great game but the monetization is simply unacceptable its already a full price game with who knows how many waves of dlc incoming and a goddamn battle pass why on earth does it cost 100 just for one set of costumes

#####

random stutters thanks denuvo

#####

juri feet porn

#####

street fighter 6 is jampacked with content features and style kudos to capcom for learning the lessons from street fighter vs barebones launch

#####

if you ever looked over and thought fighting games could be fun but its way too hard or intimidating take the leap this game is most accessible of the entire fighting genre offering many quality of life changes is well polished and feels like a genuine labour of love from the developers to ease new players the game offers a robust tutorial and a simplified modern control scheme which is on par with traditional control  unlike other fighting games this is an actual game having a decent length single player story mode which is really similar to the yakuza games either way im thoroughly enjoying my time playing sf6 and feel like ive properly got into a fighting game

#####

instead of mk1 buy this

#####

the answer lies in the heart of battle

#####

feet ass and abs

#####

good net code actually playable online thats all i needed 

#####

no one will see this so im gay for jamie


edit i gotta pay the price of ultimate edition again to get everyones third costume luhmaooo

#####

for my loyal fans

#####

alright heres the deal
this might be the best fighting game ever made
its relatively simple and easy to pick up especially with its array of accessible control options but doesnt skimp on depth or balance 
it has good netcode 
it has a gigantic set of qol features maybe the most ive ever seen in a fighting game including the best training mode ever made
it just feels good to play the input buffer and audiovisual impact are just perfect
a wide cast of characters with someone for just about any archetype or playstyle you can think of
by god theres even quality singleplayer content
so yeah id say buy this game

#####

being a few months after release i think its confident to say that this is a clear sign of evolution from the previous entries and shows that it not only learned from itself but from other fighting games as well

im not gonna pretend and be a pro and say i know the ins and outs of all the mechanics in this game but as a casual that keeps up with the competitive scene and plays semiregularly i think the fusion of mechanics has really made the game continuously engaging and entertaining the spectacle is there watching matches feels hype with drive impact and parry and theyre easy enough to use that youll get beginners to occasionally pull off crazy stuff like countering a di or getting lucky and hitting a perfect parry but they still keep their balance to where if they can be worked around if you know what youre doing and have that experience

outside of just pvp sf6 brings a lot to the table too its world tour mode lets you create your own character customize and mix and match iconic moves from the rest of the roster and from my own subjective opinion take your custom character through a decently engaging story it also has helpful teaching tools like the minigames sprinkled throughout the world like the basketball parry hadoken pizza teaching you motion inputs etc its battle hub creates a pretty nice place to socialize with other players using your avatar there you can meet sit at a cab and play other players normally play extreme battles or play some old school arcade games like sf2 final fight and others

i also have to bring up its accessibility and while i dont personally get a lot of use out of these features it really is great to see the consideration going in it has settings letting audio queues play that will inform the player of the situation in a match like the distance between charcaters side positioning crossup attack hit health and bar status highmidlow attack type

i also do wanna be completely honest and say its a far from perfect game currently its monetization policies seem to be so predatory even if they arent very intrusive the inclusion of battle passes most collaborations items or cosmetics seem to strictly for the avatar that if you play this regularly you honestly wont use to often and said items if purchasable are ridiculously expensive and that extends to outfits for characters as well i believe if you wanna purchase all the recently released outfit 3 for each character itll end up running you around 100

in conclusion because im starting to ramble this is a really fun game thatll give you hours of playtime and if you stick with it regularly it has so much to offer as a player and spectator but it sucks that even tho its a full priced game it still tries to take every dime you have

#####

i keep saying one more and its 430 am basically a first fighting game i played btw

#####

its ryu from streets

i got chunlis phone number 1010

#####

capcom is killing their games by adding the drm that blocks mods and tanks performance do not buy any capcom product until they reverse this change i know i wont vote with your wallets people

#####

street fighter 6 is a triumphant return to form for the iconic franchise a veritable feast of fighting game excellence that leaves its predecessor street fighter 5 in the dust this latest iteration is a masterclass in game design boasting an impressive roster of 18 characters a vibrant pop art aesthetic a pulsating soundtrack and a groundbreaking online battle hub that sets a new standard for online fighting game lobbies 

the games defining feature the drive system is a revelation its a gamechanger that provides a level of strategic depth and tactical flexibility that surpasses the vsystem of street fighter 5 the drive system equips each character with five potent abilities all governed by their drive gauge this system opens up a multitude of strategic options making every round a thrilling exercise in tactical decisionmaking 

the games audio design deserves special mention the soundtrack is a highenergy auditory feast that perfectly complements the onscreen action while the spatial audio design once again demonstrates capcoms mastery of the medium 

street fighter 6 also shines in its technical performance the game is optimized to perfection running smoothly on capcoms resident evil engine the inputtoscreen latency is impressively low ensuring that every button press feels responsive and satisfying 

the games art style is another standout feature the pop art aesthetic is a bold and refreshing departure from the norm infusing the game with a vibrant and energetic vibe that perfectly complements the fastpaced action 

despite its many strengths street fighter 6 is not without its flaws the singleplayer world tour mode while ambitious falls short in its storytelling however this is a minor blemish on an otherwise stellar package 

in conclusion street fighter 6 is a knockout its a featurerich fighting game that takes bold swings in many directions and while not every blow connects the ones that do land with a satisfying impact whether youre a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the genre street fighter 6 is a mustplay its a testament to capcoms enduring commitment to quality and innovation and a shining example of what a modern fighting game can and should be

#####

the game is very good
the pricing of the cosmetic battle pass dlc makes it looks like a phone game unfortunately even worse considering youve paid for the game do not buy the ultimate edition its a scam
base game is still good tho just dont expect to unlock much more than the classic outfits or get event rewards without paying 15 for each ninja turtle skin

#####

if you ever wanted to get into fighting games this game is it i am absolutely blown away by it

they slowed down the combat by a few frames making everything feel meatier and tactical drive impact is a brilliant new mechanic and the netcode and servers are great meaning every game is just a joy visually its also exceptional the character design was already great but the fidelity iswell you can see cammy stretchmarks on her butt d i am slo having a great time doing the world tour

just buy the game get your arcade stick and go searching for strengh

#####

i still suck at this game

#####

i feel tricked
they replaced the challenges from the beta which were great and immediately accessible with challenges that will be tied to a battle pass 
also can we just collectively say no to battle passes im tired of them
i dont have the time to commit to every game under the sun
other than that the game is mostly great will change my review if they remove the battle pass

#####

one of the best games ever 
positives
 amazing visuals
 engaging and deep gameplay
 great cast
 revolutionary online netcode
 rich single player content

negatives
 confusing menus
 random crashes and server issues 

overall incredible solid product

#####

i cant run the game at 60 thanks to denuvo and everything ran fine in all three beta tests thats 100 bones i want returned to me maybe ill get it later down the line but that will be in a year or two once they remove denuvo

if you see negative reviews on jun 1st just keep in mind those were mostly about people that could not be patient and was wanting to play a game that wasnt released in their region yet its nothing new with capcom games and yet even in 2023 and yet here we are

the game has so much content that youre not going to just try to play store mode and then get whooped in online versus from the world tour that allows you to have your own character to learnfightdesignglam to having retro arcade games sf6 surely took some of the older stuff they had in mind and buffed it up to a good replayable game 

the world tour reminds me of the good days that street fighter alpha 3 on the playstation 1 had you could level your character and add different stuff to it but now its more personalized and youre not just playing ryu or ken

im happy to say the netcoding and the games fps is just fine on my side i can connect to play with my friends from turkey while im from usa and have no latencyfps drop issues at all

i cant wait to see the ingame tournaments to pop up and the dlc characters to arrive

i decided to give fighting games a chance and decided to put in atleast 20 hours into the game learning classic controls and i can confidently say that i have have the most fun and enjoyment from fighting games
however at times it feels like you are going against people who have so much more experience than you but after a while everything starts to make sense and you start getting to their level
if you have never played any fighting game give it a shot you wont regret it
one thing still haunts me i am all mighty

#####

my character becomes airborne and gets tossed around like a hackey sack for 30 minutes while my inputs get eaten and im dead wtf

#####

battle hub erp simulator 1010

#####

as an old video game enthusiast capcom fan and someone whos not good at fighting games i find sf6 very entertaining 

while fan community on social media being toxic about modern type players ingame community is mostly welcoming towards all kinds of players this makes you want to play more round against same opponents regardless you win or lose 

learning things slowly while being able to compete against classic players motivates me to learn classic controls to take full control of my character and i think this is a good thing

world tour mode is something else its an sf rpg that youre playing your own created character and definitely worth to play especially if youre learning the game

and dont forget to visit battle hub with your avatar and enjoy the freakshow

#####

denuvo absolutely kills the performance on this im on a 3060ti and i cant get above 40fps in the battle hub world tours performance is terribleeven with the settings turned down i frequently drop under 60fps thats not also taking into account the micro stutter that happens frequently throughout the campaign 

re4r ran near flawlessly and so too did the betas so its absolutely shocking the full release runs the way that it does additionally whilst charging a premium of 60 for this game capcom has the audacity to include both a battle pass and a season pass id advise any potential buyers to stay clear for now and see if they can improve performance even then i recommend grabbing it on a sale just out of principal for the aggressive monetization

#####

do you like to play an inferior version of the game all in the name of preventing piracy

capcom has you covered in partnership with denuvo these geniuses thought theyre being clever by bottlenecking the crap out of the game with a drm that eats the soul of the re engine in realtime i can almost hear the whaling of the engine through my speakers as the schyth of denuvo pierces the soul of re engine with a grin


jokes aside this is a terribly janky mess   i had no issues with beta right until this piece of  trash was added i have issues with stuttering every which way thanks but no thanks capcom
ill get the better version once a queen cracks the code

#####

the online multiplayer is really fun it has great netcode and as of time of writing its incredibly active

the singleplayer campaign runs horribly though same settings as the online and a quarter of the framerate because of denuvo  if youre getting this just for the singleplayer campaign dont i really want to have fun with it but the slowdown every time i enter a battle is just depressing

#####

look i love this game its probably my favorite fighting game of all time but capcoms postlaunch monetization has left such a bitter taste in my mouth that i cant really justify giving it a good review right now its actually horrendous the fortnitetier fun buck bs they are currently getting away with also it uses denuvo and ever since akis release it has run worse on my machine than cyberpunk of all games so until these problems are gone im not giving it a thumbs up go play guilty gear xx accent core r instead

#####

yea i wont be buying capcom games anymore f enigma drm its breaks compatibility with the steamdeck


#####

cant wait for akuma

#####

fine game but the predatory monetization model is shameless

#####

has region lock making ruining online matchmaking for regions with small communities

#####

as someone who put a few thousand hours into sfiv it was a hard pill to swallow not being able to enjoy sfv in an way shape or form happy to say though that sfvi is a return to form in so many ways looking forward to playing it for years to come

1 point for hoping makoto returns


oh and the game plays really good too i guess

#####

while i havent had the chance to play much this is definitely the best a vanilla sf release has ever been you can feel the potential and the passion of the developers shines through in a myriad of details might be one of the all time greats of the fighting game genre when all is said and done

very fun and beginner friendly fighting game easy to learn hard to master

i wasnt a too big fan of the singleplayer world tour mode but then again thats not really the reason why i bought the game in the first place when doing normal matches against other players the game is great and because the movesets arent that complex winning comes more down to being able to read your opponent than anything else

i hadnt bought a fighting game at or close to launch in a very long time but i didnt regret picking up street fighter 6

#####

 stupidly silly registration process
 denuvo virus included
 game crashes constantly

#####

did sum of this irl my grampy stood no chance he in a coma now 

#####

sothey snuck denuvo into the final product and the game runs significantly worse than the demo on the same settings sf6 is a damn good game but the optimization is noticeably bad on pc which leads me to assume denuvo is at fault here since the same shit happened with re8 and dmc5 waiting for the nondenuvo exe file from the crack scene

will update this review to positive the second denuvo is removed

im not a fighting game enthusiast and this game won me from day one on the demo and the beta since sfii i havent been so excited lets go

#####

chun li makes me feel things

#####

the world tour mode and the core game are fantastic in terms of mechanics and pure gameplay this is the best sf game since third strike the roster is diverse and interesting the ability to build your own street fighter and challenge other players avatars is fun and can get very weird and wacky in the best way the world tours story is absolutely packed with references and easter eggs that will delight hardcore street fighter and final fight fans

but in terms of postlaunch content and monetization this game is terrible battle passes that demand more money in addition to play time free vs premium currencies with a down right predatory purchase model overpriced character costumes and dripfed dlc characters all add up to an incredibly frustrating and frankly insulting experience

if youre a hardcore world warrior this review isnt for you you already own this game and probably love everything about it

if you have limited time and limited money but a lot of patience i strongly advise waiting for the superhyperultrachampionarcade edition to be released and buy that youll get the game and all the dlc characters costumes stickers and other stuff for about half the price that i paid for this

i assure you this game is incredible its so much fun to play but because of its postlaunch content and its monetization of that content i cant recommend this game to adults with jobs bills and responsibilities at least not in good faith

#####

the game itself is good but there shouldnt be microtransactions in a a100 game

#####

fantastic fighting game and genius design in general 

the systems are all designed to not only teach you fundamental fighting game ideas but also in a weird and fun way 

drive meter is the big thing here its basically a combined guard and standard meter i cannot understate the genius of this entire system it rewards whiff punishing by taking away drive meter from the opponent it rewards walking forwards as it helps you recover faster it limits how defensive you can be in a multitude of ways it adds so much depth and complexity it forces not only mastering managing it but also creative ways it can be managed

your super meter is very standard get more to spend more supers however combine that with drive meter which handles ex moves as well as drive rush moves makes for better juggles basically and you get very interesting and very subjective ways it can be managed your super meter is kept between rounds but you start at 6 full drive gauges every round imo its best to spend drive gauge first and only go for super if you need the kill but the supers can only be routed in some ways as level 1 2 and 3 supers cancel from different things this immediately changes routing and a lot of combos require very quick thinking not only to perform but to decide if you even want to go for that much not only that but some routes are inherently harder give different positioning after it finishes might cost too much drive gauge than you have might not even kill etc its up to you to decide how you actually want to spend that resource and honestly you can come up with genuinely good and valid reasons for why you overunder spent i wanted the situation after or i really thought it would kill

the pressure is really smart you have a mechanic called drive parry its less of a parry and more of ex blocking that costs meter to commit to but gives you back meter as you get hit in the stance it blocks left right high low for you but getting thrown does a lot of damage genius idea the character power is really high a lot of characters have some messed up mixups and pressure the best way to deal with it might be this mechanic however no matter how much you hold drive parry at any point the opponent can just stop attacking and grab you drive parry has recovery after all pressure is so fucked up an omniblock isnt strong enough lol

a funny thing about drive parry you can enter an ex dash called drive rush just by double tapping while in the stance what this does is add 4 frames of hit or block stun to your normals effectively making the frame data matter a lot however every one has a 4 frame normal what that means is theres really still only 4 types of situations to look for

plus lol
0 to 3 not punishable but its the defenders turn
4 to 7 just barely punishable
minus a lot lol

why does that matter well if drive rush adds 4 frames of block stun and everyone has a 4 frame normal you treat it the same just in a group higher if the move is already plus its obviously plus with drive rush if its 3 or higher it will add 4 frames its plus if its 4 to 7 its now safe obviously if its more than 7 then you can punish it that one is technically weird and requires a lot of memorization but why would you make something 30 26 why spend meter on that yes you can technically make an optimal punish for that but no one is doing that on the other end if they actually think lol you dont have to worry about it

i really only have two gripes with the systems it self the smaller one is just its a modern fighting game its design is around having a lot of combos and routes and they all bring to a softhard knock down and they end up creating simple flowchartable pressure as a reward and not another portion of the game to think about it makes good use of these ideas i was literally just gushing about the combo and pressure system after all though if its not your thing it probably wont sell you on it

the other is that drive impact makes a more reactions based game when in play its very easily countered you just do drive impact back using it as a punish is a lot riskier than just whiff punishing and doing a combo if you fuck up the timing they again just di through it back i dont know how i would fix this as generally the best response to di is di on reaction if the opponent is using it you should be using it too i just dont think its that cool its not too hard to react to if youre looking for it and as long as youre using cancellable normals you can do it 95 of the time with practice idk just makes it a little silly i like the regular neutral a lot but having di in there makes it focus really hard on robotically picking safe thing and  reacting basically

i didnt mean for this review to be this long but whatever i just like this game a lot it has a lot to think about and has amazing tutorials and resources even in game to teach you enough to figure out a lot on your own and if you do need help its street fighter so of course resources are actually out there play it

#####

sf6 was great i really enjoyed the world tour and the new combat systems and characters the battlehub the minigames all that good stuff

however i later realized that they put in a premuim battlepass in the game
and i already payed 60 for this game so i dont really understand why they put the music for the jukebox stickers emotes and some of best character clothes in the game behind a paywall

i think greed is really scummy in the videogame industry right now 
and streetfighter was already going to make much more money through future dlc characters so this is just overkill at its finest and this trend has to go to away

i cannot recomend this game even if it is a fun and solid fighting game at its core because it dosent give you what you paid for

#####

im a big fan of this game actually 80 hours across 2 different platforms but you cant add some busted drm onto your game half a year after release and then start a week long sale out of nowhere to try to sweep the issue under the rug 

at this point youre giving tekken 8 free advertising by being complete shit the same way you did for tekken 7 during sfvs run

#####

far way better than sfv

fighting in the streets for the 6th time

#####

probably the easiest fighting game to get into theres lots of side stuff that teach you the game without it feeling like grinding in the lab and theres almost a character for every fighting archetype so you should find something that fits your hands

#####

fix the matchmaking region lock please

#####

capcom has added drm to the game like 7 months after release unacceptable

#####

brilliant and fun fighting game coming from a casual fighting games player i played sf5 for a very small amount of time it didnt really interest me but man when they announced 6 and showed game play i honestly thought it would be the same game plastered with new graphics that i didnt quite like the look of and a single player campaign that had a bit more game play and story

boy was i wrong

to start the improved graphics look amazing and really meld well with the new animations with each characters super arts and special moves the new characters to me arent forgettable and are really cool to either play against and or use with each having cool personalities and great fluid animations and moves not to forget the brilliant voice acting of all the characters in the roster

the single player campaign is great although im not really one for story focused fighting games its quite enjoyable and fun you can create a fully customizable character with your favourite in game fighters move set fancy having a character that resembles slender man and can do chunlis spinning bird kick you can have that maybe create a small blobby character with juris kick combo you can have that its quite insane and makes for a fun time especially when fighting other peoples custom characters and or friends 

for the price point i bought the game at full retail value im a person who decides that if i buy a 60 game i should in turn get the same amount of hours back of fun game play and this does not disappoint


#####

listen i absolutely love this game  ive been playing it on the weekly since it came out and have seriously grinded it out this is a fantastic fighting game but i just cant get behind these monetisation practices that capcom have been doing outfit 3 for the base roster of 18 characters came out today and they all look great  i was fully intending on buying them in a full bundle package if that was available because all the skins are genuinely really great additions to their respective characters 

however the pricing on these skins is absolutely ridiculous for skins that are a mere cosmetic change street fighter 6 only just went on sale for the first time and has otherwise been retailing at fullprice which is fair by the way  this is a complete full fighting game experience out of the box many of the other microtransaction stuff in this game has been a little sus but excusable outfit 2 could be purchased with fighter coins but could also be genuinely earned through world tour mode if you were so inclined for the record world tour is really not my speed so i made a one time 5usd purchase to get outfit 2 for ken ryu chun cammy and juri  a pretty reasonable price for alternate costumes if you ask me

then there was the teenage mutant ninja turtles debacle where if you wanted all of that content youd have to buy two batches of 2750 fighter coins at 100 usd 40 more than the asking price of the game there was some well deserved criticism from the community on this but largely silence on capcoms part in response to the outcry nonetheless it was only for world tour avatars so i can only imagine the amount of people actually buying this stuff cant have been too high 

but now here we are at costume 3 unlike costume 2 which cost 50 coins a pop essentially 1 each these cost 300 fighter coins with no way to earn them or coins ingame without spending money worse yet the minimum amount of these coins you can buy in a single purchase is 250 for 5usd meaning that at minimum even if you only want one skin you will b have to drop at least 5 more than you wanted to and with coins leftover that cant even buy you another skin b the most economically friendly way to get them all is to buy two batches of 2750 fighter coins making it the same price as the ninja turtles collab costumes  100usd to put it in perspective the year 1 pass that gives you access to four new characters is only 30usd and those are actually worth spending the dough on how does it make sense that cosmetic skins for characters already in the game cost over triple what new characters do especially when costume 2 as a microtransaction costs so little 

this live service bs simply doesnt belong in any fullpriced game period its just such a shame because i know there are lots of people who like me would really like to get these skins id be more than happy to fork out the cash for them at a reasonable price but nearly double what the actual game is worth is just fucking absurd its extra heartbreaking because as you can probably presume from my hours i really do love street fighter 6 a lot but i genuinely think the games reputation is gonna keep taking hits if this kind of monetisation practice continues capcom i really implore you to reconsider your strategy towards this stuff because its genuinely very predatory to have in a fullpriced video game that is sheer excellence in every other regard

#####

pretty good except for the fact that the random select in the game does not randomize skins and colours

#####

amazing game a huge step up from sf5s launch and the core gameplay loop is fun im not a big fan of the art style and the motion captured animations while detailed mostly lack the snappiness  readability of hand done animations like sf4 marvel 3 or king of fighters 

the world tour mode is very fun the single player experience capcom has provided is the best theyve ever done in any fighting game

netcode feels smooth for almost every match

i wish the game center had 2 player on at least some games final fight for instance but i understand they dont want to step on the toes of their classic arcade game bundles still an amazing addition id never have expected in a million years

now for the bad parts and they are pretty bad

denuvo is causing the game to use up a lot more resources while i could run the demo on max and keep a solid 60fps or more in world tour  in battle hubs for demo im dropping into the 50s in battlehub and my gpu is getting very hot

there is no word filters on names or text ive seen a number of extremely racist things

the keyboard layout for world tour mode is pretty bad

the menus are awful and setting characters to dif control schemes is unintuitive

the worst thing of all
the economy is set up like a free 2 play game on a title that is 60 drive ticket items are over priced  hard to get fighter coins are an unneeded currency designed specifically to psychologically manipulate people their value is too low 1 for a single color sfxt you could get a full costume for 1 almost every thing you can purchase except colors are in multiples of 100 but coins are bought not in multiples of 100 this is designed very specifically to get players to feel a sense of sunk cost if they dont buy more coins they wont be able to empty their account and will feel they have wasted money if you bought 50 of coins crazy i know then you get 2750 coins barely 10 more than if you paid the minimum that number of coins means unless you buy more or buy a color you will be left with extra if you pay for the 12 610 coin bundle then youll have to buy at least 4 more 12 bundles just to get to a multiple of 50  be able to zero out with a color scheme

as great as this game is it deserves to be review bombed strictly because of fighter coins you already paid 60 a free 2 play economy is awful if youre gonna do microtransactions dont lie to your fan base with company store situation

#####

edited review in what can only be interpreted as an internal competition between capcom and other companies capcom has decided to start adding an invasive drm to their old games soon coming to the new ones too the enigma drms sole function is to prevent players from modding their games but it also comes with other drawbacks such as
 making performance worse lowering fps by between 10 and 15
 rendering games unplayable on the steam deck
 allowing games to randomly crash for no reason
capcom needs pushback on this dont let them get away with it

#####

street fighter 6 seeks to reinvigorate the series following the mixed reception to street fighter v and it does so by taking criticism of v very much to heart the new drive system is quite versatile and can be used at just about any time in a match in comparison to the v system from the previous game street fighter v was also widely criticized for its lack of meaningful singleplayer content at launch and really for its first two years and 6 addresses that with perhaps the most ambitious singleplayer mode in the fighting game genre a globetrotting adventure with explorable 3d maps high levels of customization and a plethora of quests sidequests and minigames to indulge in and the actual fighting is as fun to play as its ever been

street fighter 6 ultimately makes for an excellent jumping on point for newcomers and casual players while also offering more than enough to sate longtime fans of the series and genre

#####

fun game terrible monetization build up confidence with bomb games then hit the fanbase with greed real nice capcom

#####

they managed to bring it back after the dumpster fire that was sf5 but man the monetization and amount of content is atrocious 

pros
fantastic system to build on
fun ranked
great newcomers manon jamie lily jp
style

cons
dlc comes out slow
monetization is greedy and set up to milk you
it has blanka in it

#####

this game really rocks my socks
but these costumes and skins cost more than a tank of gas
910


#####

where to start

the game itself fighting and visuals are everything you could ask for in a new gen fighting game
the story mode is a good way to kill some time however be warned that it is very repetitive and almost mind numbing to a certain point
its also a long drawn out training ground for learning all of the characters styles if you look at it that way  
i do love the fact that you can create your own fighter and mix and match different special attacks regardless of the base fighting style 
this to me is what most people have been wanting to do for years and they knocked that part out of the park

the online fighting can be hit or miss at times 
ive had issues queuing for a match or it would load the fight only to be disconnected immediately 
when it works though its fun 

if your just looking for a fighting game a break from mortal kombat or just want something to hold you over until tekken then this is it

#####

most of the negative review dont understand the game actually install then reorganizes the files just check your download page status then the game can be played and oh boy what a wonder ive rarely felt a game of this magnitude likeable new characters marisa and manon are my favorites the game is fun on the casual side to farm money and the training mode and learning curve is fun one important aspect is that losing in this game does not makes you feel you wanna jump from a bridge and fall in a bottomless pit filled with broken glass like the previous game no you dont die because you made one mistake and keep guessing characters variety ensure the game remains very fun to learn cant wait to finish my work today and go back to grind i think capcom hit it right this time its a masterpiece

#####

ryu is kinda hot

#####

the best street fighter game since 3rd strike and the best fighting game overall in the last 15 years at least

denuvo has tanked the game on steam deck im really going to have to tinker with this game tonight to get a stable 60fps on world tour
download the world tour demo you wont have this issue
i cant recommend to steam deck users until capcom fix or denuvo is removed

#####

i will only change my review when you remove drm and allow for modding if you want people to play and enjoy your game you need to allow modding there is a difference between cheating and modding get off your high horse just because sf6 is good doesnt mean we havent forgotten how scummy you were with sfv and now with drm and removing modding

sf6 is a good game but you capcom are being the worst company now

#####

denuvo  anticonsumer

#####

casually 63214p you with 5 medals and a dream

#####

the game is amazing

the predatory micro transactions are just garbage

#####

the game is amazing but it has no business having a battlepass on top of dlc wtf capcom

#####

   after years of mediocre halfassed fighting games that never truly delivered we finally got a real gem on our hands 

street fighter 6 is the best fighting game to come out in a decade and is the best sf game since third strike this game looks amazing the colors pop the moves have weight and combos are fun and satisfying to land every character is extremely well animated and through those animations and stylized visuals their unique personalities really shine this is the first time street fighter looked good in 3d using re engine was a great decision 

the newcomers are some of the best the series has seen so far and all the new characters are varied and unique some taking inspirations from legacy characters and giving them a modern twang the returning characters have gotten great redesigns and plenty of new moves and tools added to their arsenal making some of them feel completely brand new 

the drive system is a big part of what makes this game feel fresh and engaging with the drive gauge you have 5 different options at your disposal to spend that meter all of which are useful depending on the situation the burnout mechanic punishes you for using up all your meter which encourages players to be more calculated and conservative in how they spend their meter 

the game is feature complete the netcode is nearperfect and the game has tons of bang for your buck if you arent into fighting pvp then theyve got you covered with world tour mode which is a full fledged yakuza styled gamemode where you go around a big map with people to beat up hidden treasures platforming and minigames admittedly i wasnt too interested in world tour mode until i played it but i can honestly say its pretty fun i enjoyed making a character and buying different clothes while leveling them up through an rpg skill tree and customizing their abilities to make my own movelist 

i also have to applaud capcom for finding a way to make the game highly accessible to new players who never played fighting games while at the same time not compromising legacy players and the games complexity modern controls is a genius idea because it offers new players a fun and simple control scheme that is balanced in a way that doesnt make classic controls obsolete and isnt just an ez mode free win button if you have never played a fighting game before and always wanted to get into one then this is the perfect game to introduce you to the genre 

if i had one gripe with this game it is that the music was underwhelming and boring to me at least compared to previous sf soundtracks there are a couple outliers that i do enjoy like the france stage theme jamie and rashids theme and a lot of the world tour music i enjoy quite a bit but the overall character themes that you will be hearing 90 of the time are kinda lackluster in my opinion 

with that being said sf6 is still super fun balanced and complex and quite frankly it takes a fat curly dump on all these filler fgs that have been coming out the last few years cough coughstrive mk cough

street fighter 6 has raised the bar skyhigh for the future of fighting games and is the only modern fighting game i will be heavily invested in until tekkgawd 8 releases

tldr this game is awesome

#####

netcode is good fighting feels good minus that stupid issue where they didnt show that stuff hasnt finished downloading leading people to believe that the base game is incomplete just had to wait a bit and the fighting ground and world tour finished downloading and became available good game so far

will reevaluate in the next few days

#####

i never really played a fighting game seriously since forever but damn this game is so good in many ways i love world tour mode where you play as your avatar and you can master all skills and special moves from all street fighters 6 cast

this game has a lot of options and tools to help you learn the basics and your character its crazy

i wanted to play with modern controll but i really dont like the simplicity of it sure i get my ass kicked with classic controls but its so satisfying to fully control my favorites characters  cammy and ken  and when i succeed to land combos its feels really good 

i really recommand this game to newbies like me if classic controls feels to difficult for you you can play with modern controls for a while to acomodate to the game and if you feel really invested you can switch to classic controls

btw i played 30 hours with my xbox one controller but i switched to logitech precision because xbox one dpad is in my opinion really bad and it hurts to do the quarter circle motions the logitech precision dpad and buttons layout is way better 3

#####

i love feet

#####

id like to preface this that if you live in a major populated region this game is great probably the best package in modern game fighter history however i cannot in good faith recommend the game to people as the last second addition of denuvo has created numerous performance issues but mostly due to the downright idiotic region lock system implemented in ranked matchmaking

when queueing for ranked there appears to be a regional lock that only matches you with people in or near your country this might sound like it makes some sense but it absolutely does not sea players cant play with japan but can play with counties they have worse ping with i personally get 30 minute queues to match with a turksih guy on 150 ping but cant play vs germans who give me 8090 ping in battlehub this system is truly baffling in its stupidity especially because there is already a connection indicator a wifi indicator and the option to filter bad connections in the matchmaking menu as well as a nocontest ruling and the option to blacklist laggy players 

there is 0 reason to implement or keep around this region lock considering it does not work it does not help make the games less laggy and it makes it so a brand new fighter with 60k active players takes 30 minutes and 80 communication errors that make you restart the matchmaking  to find an opponent in many regions in the world this is grimy and has yet to be adressed with capcoms history i doubt it will be adressed anytime soon either 

if you want to play battlehub only or just the singleplayer content feel free to disregard this review entirely

no teamblaming
9510 netcode would be a 1010 if you could set your preferred input delay setting
decent balance for launch
crossplay
you can play with your brother that doesnt know whats going on by giving him huge advantage and making it a fun match if youre a veteran player
actual fun game that rewards people who put in the time as it should

sf6 has some annoying issues at higher levels of play like the huge input buffer system inconsistent drive impact cancellation the top tier character have barely any weakness regionlocked matchmaking etc

but i say launch competitive games overall will always have issues some small some unfortunately big for sf6s launch its actually quite good and i dont think itll hurt the lower level players that much

hopefully as more updates come better balancing more consistency in certain stuff this game will be one of the best fighting games ever made

hell its already my favorite multiplayer game of all time as a fellow high ranked player in multiple games

every competitive player if they havent ever played any fg seriously id say they should give sf6 a go

just going to add my negative review for enigma drm early because they just added it to monster hunter rise i wish they would stop being stupid

the game is fine otherwise

just going to update my review and add that the dlcfight coin bs is bad

ed is 350 fight coins 3rd costume is 300 fight coins not obtainable in game they sell 610 fight coin packs shorting you by 40 coins to make you buy a bigger pack or spend an additional 5 dollars on the 250 fight coins

#####

i really like the story for a very long time and interesting the game is cool super 1010

#####

cammy got her whole pussy cheeks and bootyhole hanging out

capcom hates mods so much theyre willing to tank  performance for their game and give consumers multiple trojan viruses via a sketchy drm made by one dude i loved this game when i first got it but now im legitimately worried to run it ive seen far too many reports of different anti viruses flagging this game as a virus now avoid capcom like the plague until they fix this issue or at the very least add a legitimate drm that wont infect your pc

h2 costume update h2

bravo crapcom bravo

somehow you made a fighting game with a monetization even worse than doa5 and doa6 thats a pretty good achievement you all should be proud

 100 for some fucking costumes  are your idiot brains getting fucked by stupid

this also applies to the dumb ass consumers that made this a normal thing in this day and age

congratufuckinglations


h2 pre costume update h2

denuvo and monthly battle passes in a fucking 60 game with yearly 3050 season passes

just release the new shit as dlcs theres no need to resort to shitty f2p predatory business practices it just shows how greedy and scummy crapcom really is

modern age gaming is a fucking joke

#####

i like this game its good

#####

cachcom did another greedy cashgrab even more than ever
yet another anticonsumer dlc practices can we just get what we already had in usfiv years ago without cutting it on pieces and locking behind the paywalls

sf6 is 60 game and you only get 2 colors per character the only way to unlock the other ones is to pay real money for them ive been playing for 30 hours and still only have 500 drive tickets and you need 1000 for a single color at the moment the only way to get more drive tickets is to wait for the monthly challenges and they only gives you 500 in sf4 you just had to use the character in a single match and youd unlock a color your only options in sf6 wait literal months or pay for them
people didnt like monetization in sfv alright here we go now you pay for each piece of content you should actually already own within the game at the start buy season pass buy battle pass plus buy bp autounlock if youre not living in a game or you might miss a content you already payed an access for

not to mention infamous horrible technical conidition in world tour mode huge texture popup low res everywhere framedrops on various machines absolute garbage abomination meme festival in battle hub at least battle ground is alright i wonder why its been made as a dlc and not the core game menu

two generations earlier street fighter iv revived the fighting game industry on the newest level made it with dignity and passion under the yoshinori ono but cashcom decided to ruin it again

welcome to the modern state of gaming
oh and yes modern controls eww

#####

how dare capcom think they have any right to install software onto my computer that instantly flags as malware absolutely wretched company carried only by the love people have for their legendary ips the only thing i can blame more than capcom is myself for  allowing myself to stupidly ever be convinced and peer pressured into giving this company any semblance of a second chance

if you value yourself or at  the very least your computer and security boycott capcom at lightspeed

#####

yeah gotta say youre photogenic

#####

capcom is killing their games by adding the drm that blocks mods and tanks performance do not buy any capcom product until they reverse this change i know i wont vote with your wallets people

#####

remove denuvo drm bullshit you capitalist pig

edit drm is not good for anyone including the idiots that defend it because they are idiots

#####

battle passuglydenuvoim bad

#####

cammy

#####

i wish i could refund this game after the drm addition i will not be purchasing a single capcom product until it is removed blacklisted just like ubisoft at this point fuck around find out

#####

a return to greatness for the series after the letdown that was launch sfv good connection quick matchmaking and new player accessibility will keep this game feeling fresh for a long time

#####

battle pass was downplayed until after the review embargo was up
the presence of denuvo was sneakily added to the steam page less than twelve hours after the review embargo was up and by accounts the review copies were all on console

these two things make for some very suspicious behavior from capcom in general and hard to trust them on anything going forward even if the game itself is as excellent as the rest of the reviews on the internet make it out to be

#####

this game brought so many emotions toward me this was my first fighting game that i wanted to take seriously i started in silver and fought tooth and nail to rank up hitting hard walls on the way today 328 i finally hit master after starting from the very beginning of release to now it was the best journey full of hype that i will never forget

#####

street fighter is back on the menu

#####

fantastic game one of the best ive ever played or had the pleasure of being around

but

review will remain negative until egregious f2plike monetization is addressed

#####

battle passes overpriced cosmetics drm post launch

capcom has unfortunately been very clear they dont respect their players
microtransactions and battle passes have no place in fighters

#####

its a good game but capcom has no excuse forcing people into paying more than what a dlc character is actually worth street fighter will sell dlc regardless of if they incorporate an awful tactic like this or not i wont be buying any dlc unless it changes

#####

consider this a rage quit you might be reading this thinking wow he has 182 hours in this game but doesnt recommend it that is a lot of playtime for something that isnt recommended however it isnt that simple sf6 is a good game if you come at it from a casual perspective go enjoy the story mode mess around with modern controls dabble in online via battle hub youll have a good time with it coming at it like that

i want to love this game from a competitive perspective and at times i do there are some cool character designs combos feel good online isnt laggy the drive system is neat but also the drive system is bad and why i dont recommend the game

you will hear pros and the fgc say the game is well balanced and in a sense it is any character can beat any other character but thats the case with any game im sure there are games significantly less balanced than this however the top characters in this game are miles ahead of the bottom characters beyond that at a high level of play a lot of the game boils down to which character has a crouching medium kick that can cancel into drive rush even when you play a character that has the ability to do that it is so incredibly unfun to get hit by that and watch anywhere from 3060 of your health drain dash up crouching medium kick shouldnt be a viable competitive option

you dropped a combo time to get punished with a double drive rush level 3 combo that essentially sees you lose the round youre trapped in the corner blocking because luke and ken have insane corner carry and their buttons are infinitely better than the rest of the cast lets punish you for blocking by draining your drive meter every time you block an attack

at some point the game went from fun to frustrating i got manon from plat 3 to master and thought id have more fun playing a character that had more tools and actually utilized the games unique mechanics so i switched to juri went from plat 3 to diamond 4 with her and realized i wasnt having fun anymore i was frustrated with every loss i didnt have a desire to learn new setups or combos because the defensive side of the game is just so incredibly frustrating

im sure this review will be met with tons of people saying im a scrub to just get good and every other lame fgc quip thats fine a game can be full of absolutely corny mechanics and overpowered characters its okay to acknowledge that and move on from it instead of being stuck in an eternal cycle of frustration

in short you will like this game if you play it casually you might like this game if you want to play it seriously im just tried of being frustrated at the way the game is balanced

#####

the game is great i even grinded for three full days to get to gold 4 and start learning juri i even bought the battle pass like an idiot because i plan to commit to this game and grinding out kudos is not that hard
what pisses me off is not even the battle pass even though thats inexcusable its the extra mile capcom goes to screw over the consumer with the predatory monetization like the fact you cant even buy dlc from steam but you have to instead buy their retarded coins at set increments so that you will always have leftovers obviously they wont let you earn the premium currency via gameplay because why the fuck would they
even the dlc fighters are overpriced costing even more than tekken ones so thats something i dont plan to buy any time soon its a shame because i can tell the developers really put their soul into this game but capcom very clearly hates the player
hopefully things will turn for the better with time but i cant say i expect them to

#####

will change the reviews once the tmnt song stops playing in bh i now hate tmnt and havent had appetite for pizzas for weeks

edit thumbs up now its a good game please dont ever do that to bh again

#####

one of the best fighting game of alltime

#####













#####

i am negativating this beautifull and excelent game because the war of its creator capcom on modds hope they change their ways when the situation changes i would gladly change my review

i put a lot of time in street fighter 6 since lunch and i have to say i love it probably one of my favorite fighting games of all time its up there no joke its so fresh and new that you can be there for hours just training world tour battle hub online classic story and so much more its endless how much you can do its so jam packed with things to do for people that are new at the game and trying to get in or even for hardcore street fighter veteran players what i love about it that everyone plays differently its so versatile then ever before with the drive mechanics feeling like one on one mind games that make it super fun and never boring the online net code is really good havent had really problems with it its a must have for any fighting game fan trust me this is a great comeback for street fighter with more fighters coming down the road as well now if capcom just can do something with the pricing with these skins then it would be even better

#####

this is the best street fighter yet from the amazing graphics to the new story mode there is massive amounts of replayability with an even higher skill ceiling with new features like drive impact this will sure to be the most fun of the series yet

#####

stutter fighter 6

thnx denuvo

#####

i have 400 hours on console this game is great

i needed to get it for steam deck to play ranked matches in the shower oh yeah

#####

best beginnerfriendly fighting game single player world tour mode is a great way to learn the mechanics of the game theres also a control scheme called modern that makes the game more accessible for newer players in the genre this is my first fighting game ive ever tried seriously and im already addicted to the improvement i see myself getting just by playing the game and labbing stuff in training mode ranked matchmaking is a good way to play people around your skill level and with the bonus winstreak its been helpful to rank up from iron all the way to platinum with your character losing is learning in this game and with the fundamentals that i picked up in street fighter 6 will for sure help me learn other fighting games in the future

#####

in this update we got
capcoms shitty drm
worse performance 
no modding even if its just single player 
players getting a virus 

#####

region lock ranked takes the fun out of this game
not recommended for anyone in indiabetter wait for 80 percent off

#####

solid gameplay but the coin system is outrageous
its not only expensive but also set up to force you to buy more  expensive  coins that you need capcom is really taking the p#ss

#####

abysmal monetization galore to unlock the secondary costumes you either need to do a crazy grind in a game mode that runs so terribly its nearly unplayable or spend money the colors cant be unlocked without money as well

#####

the real fight comes from the heart people can only give you the tools and show you the controls to fight fighting games are more difficult than any other games ive encountered and frustrating too  the training mode of this game is efficient as hell but feels like a bore currently the combos of combo trials are absurd as usual but character guides are good finding ranked matches is tough in india and i dont like to play in battlehub or custom rooms since everyone is op i have little memory for combos or supers there is no good keyboard mapping for modern controls and playing with gamepad sucks

the game can be a ruddy downer to be honest wins can feel empty and losing sucks

the world tour can be fun though roster of players is good costumes good move list good taunts bad we dont need salt in the wounds capcom emotesdance moves good social features good 

add  i made a friend or two today that felt good

these videos are worth a look imo

#####

i love this game so much i want it to be so good but oh my god capcom is so greedy just be better capcom

#####

i think i broke my controller

#####

imagine youre playing a f2p game and that game has kind of an aggressive monetizetion philosofy where anything that comes with updates costs money kinda sucks but it makes sense right

now imagine you paid for a full priced game and that game also has aggressivepredatory monetization where if you want to unlock lets say the clothes for only the base roster of 18 characters you have to pay almost double that 60 dollars game

well you dont need to imagine no more

capcom presents the most dumb monetization of a japanese fighting game ever

how in the most sweet and holy fck capcom thought 18 costumes were more expensive than an entire game this stuff should be unlockable in world tour

#####

awesome game but capcom trash for adding drm and breaking the game on steam deck enjoy this l

#####

fun game

#####

i have to look away any time i win as juri to signal i am not into feet but otherwise a 1010 fighting game package

#####

here of review on this game

 street fighter 6 offers the most flexible versatile and expressive combat seen in the series to date
 the game is bursting at the seams with things to do assured in its robustness from the word go
 the online mode in street fighter 6 is genuinely fantastic and one of the smoothest online experiences in a fighting game
 the characters animations are breathtaking even for the most basic of moves
 street fighter 6 is a benchmark moment for the 2d fighting game genre and feels extra special
 the game is an adventure game and adventure and seek bully


#####

its fun the first 40 hours and it might be fun for some mindless fighting here and there because the gameplay loop is fun but eventually you reach a point where you start to see this game for what it is complete fcking bllshit  

the game doesnt have much to praise outside of the combat against players and i think in terms of gameplay and visuals and music etc its worth a good review for those things but its like a jewel stone covered in diarrhea because the amount of problems this game has overshadows the enjoyment gotta mention that people had perfect frames in the demo version of the game but then they added denuvo and ruined it 

2 words can be used to describe capcom in a nutshell greed and favourtism 
you pay 60 for this game and theres a premium battlepass in it the music jukebox stickers emotes and character clothes and colours are behind a paywall you gotta pay like 10 dollars for a single character and that is completely overkill because they are planning to add tons of characters in the future and this greed trend must end this is record breaking greed even epic games has a battlepass more generous this is just shameless greed pricing the game that high when all this other shit is behind a paywall


h1 cons h1
 denuvo silently added 12 hours before release which can make the game borderline unplayable for some computers as it creates unbearable lag and issues that will ruin your combos and possible get you to lose the match they did everything to keep it a secret until launch in fear of people cancelling their preorders 
 battle pass in full price game
 yearly 3050 season passes
 cash store in full price game
 pay to unlock colours
 servers suck  data collection  mandatory capcom account  capcom support doesnt reply or send me email to reset my password so had to make a new capcom account
 battle pass does not even unlock any characters
 anticonsumer dlc practices
 matchmaking region lock bullshit
 rashid is 350 coins the lowest amount you can buy is 250 coins for 5 so you have to pay 10 for 500 coins
 challenges in this game look like they were made in 3 minutes
 tedious gameplay grind just to get an alternative classic skin for the character you want its extremely slow its to tempt you to just buy the skin alternatively greedy
 barely any characters at launch aside from the favorites fighting the same subset of characters all the time gets old very fast
 loop grabs
 basicly forces you to get a hitbox if you play with keyboard 
 you can create an amazing character avatar however there are very few costume pieces to use and they are generic your character does not feel like an unique fighter with a cool outfit
 character roster should be twice as big and you have to pay for every character i bet everyone is looking forward to those 20 characters being added in the future each costing 10 dollars street fighter 4 launched with 33 characters back in 2008 the company is now 99 times bigger theres no excuse to not have more characters at launch 
 world tour is basicly copy of yakuza but worse  generic copy paste enemies that run after you to fight you on the streets very few of the fights actually contribute to any kind of story that the supposed rpg mode of the game claims to have
 why do you accept invites in news
 balance 410 kens in lower tiers can be gods tf capcom
 di is bllshit very fast and covers a long distance absorbs 2 hits and if you block it you are pushed back really far and if you are in the corner you wall bounce its basicly i hit you with it i win i do di and if you do di right before i hit you you win it becomes a chore eventually 
 the matchmaking ranking system is also useless outside of diamond it literally has no bearing with player skill in the rank i fought bronze players 47 times better than gold players
 stupid capcom registration process
 drive rush ruins the neutral game with being able to just zip past neutral into your opponents face deejay also most of your normals are on block and to make them positive you have to drive rush you pretty much cant do frame traps without using drive rush
 random roll back despite it saying 0f and the ping is good enough
 world tour is a mess of back tracking  back tracking 9x fast travel to a place speak to a human fast travel back to the city then go change the day to night go speak to human go fight go fast travel go change the night to day also enemy spam everywhere to drag time out the ai changes rules on the go just to make sure you die you stun lock an enemy only for them to break out mid stun and boom you are stun locked now 

h1 pros h1
 gameplay 710
 animations 910
 content 710
 netcode is extremely good
 good trialcombo practice
 training mode is great
 good visuals

h1 gameplay thing h1
its pretty easy to see how people are blind to the negatives of the gameplay you have characters like ken that has literally everything a fighting game character could ever wish for  good antiairs good reversals corner carry good pokingfootsies good pressure and mix ups and projectile spam but when someone suggests that a grappler zangief should have a decent antiair reversal or even fcking double lariat crossup rashid has crossup but not zangief gg capcom then thats absurd 
zangief is currently the worst character in the game burns meter like crazy tundra storm only works in 3777 scenarios far running bear grab is 100 useless unless the other opponent doesnt know what it does overhead is slow and minus 1 week on block hes utterly flawed as a grappler he cant punish people holding upback without taking big risk lariat hitbox doesnt cross up no cancellable mediums gets blown up by di  punishing people jumping is high risk and lariat hitbox sucks new mechanics work against him inconsistant grab hitbox big hitbox bad walk speed absolutely no oki whatsoever all his dr oki is fake worst matchups in the game no invincible reversal when 99 of other characters have it no corner carry close running bear grab has no armour od lariat isnt invincible and can be cancelled if someone does a poke right and i get it grapplers are supposed to be hard to master but zangief is an actual punching bag in this game compared to the other games mess up because of weird hitbox once as zangief  lose 50 to 75 of your health its no wonder zangief is the rarest character you see in high rank games also his burnout lasted 25 longer than any other character for 2 months and that was a bug  if this was a bug with cammy or ken that shit would be fixed in 1 hour it doesnt help i tried out marisa and guile and won most of my games due to them being easy to play and zoners ranked doesnt do a good job of showing peoples skills you could perfectly ko a platinum 5 player while losing to a bronze marisaken if characters are made with favoritism in mind then why does ranked even exist  also why is modern in ranked isnt ranked supposed to be fair playing against assisted players isnt balanced despite the damage reduction 

street fighter 6 iteration of zangief   worst grappler in video game 


h1 conclusion h1
its a good fighting game but wrapped in alot of problems capcom sometimes makes quality games however they are very anti consumer and greedy expect every future dlc to be 10 dollars for a single character whats the point of different playstyles if you can just select ken that has everything a fighting game character needs and world tour isnt anything special and gets very repetitive this game looks like its gonna take the halo infinite route 

i would like to see some reviews that criticise the game for its bullsht and reviews that arent just cammy butt juri feet game good stop talking hate

#####

id love to recommend this game now but unfortunately due to capcoms ingame monetization methods and use of premium currency i cant in good conscience recommend it anymore

ill start off by saying that this is genuinely a really good fighting game with great mechanics and netcode while the cast is limited and definitely favours the cast of sf2 over other games in the series with their returning characters each character is unique with their own fleshed out play style the netcode is smooth world tour offers a lot of single player content if only for a pretty shallow story

i cant however stand behind the decision to make every microtransaction left behind ingame currency that can only be purchased in very specific and honestly predatory bundles avatar items that are used exclusively for your avatar in the battle hub world tour and avatar battles can cost up to 20 for a full set not to mention how the tmnt crossover was monetized to cost 60 for all of the turtles that were just avatar costumes that alone is bad but with how theyve introduced the additional costumes for the playable characters is what makes me frustrated each characters new costume costs 300 fighter coins however the 2 lowest bundles for fg are 250 and 610 meaning you have to spend twice the amount for one costume that you want and at what costs 16cad so 8 per costume

if you want to ignore all of the monetization of this game youll have a good game on your hands youll just have extremely limited ways of aesthetically expressing yourself ingame unless you drain your wallet but i cant support the way this game has been monetized postlaunch for what is already a fullpriced 70 game

#####

 great pick up and put down game  no need for heavy time commitment unless you are trying to climb the ranks
 multiplayer is smooth  feels like youre playing against someone offline on the same consolepc rollback netcode if you want to read up on this
 crossplay
 buttery animations
 easy for new comers to pick up  world tour pve mode and dont listen to others bashing on modern controls theyre made for newcomers to learn fundamentals in a fighting game or for someone who just cant articulate movements well with their left thumb on a dpad for more than 15 minutes
 ranked mode puts you on a level similar to others  i recommend this mode over casual battles if youre learning the game
 microtransactions dont give anyone an advantage  theyre just cosmetics

 there are microtransactions
 the battle pass doesnt motivate me enough to want to grind for it
 as with any competitive video game there is toxicity in the battle hub mode so youll have to tune it out or block users  or just dont worry about this mode at all

#####

microtransactions battlepass and expensive preorder dlc denuvo too

the foundation of the game is amazing and its very feature rich but full price for another game expecting you to play it like a job and paying even more regardless is truly tiresome

im not mad just disappointed
may keep an eye on if it gets better or if we get the ultra omega edition later down the line which provides all the content for a fair price doubtful that

#####

add g or q

#####

 bugs since release are not getting fixed instead they focus on releasing more avatar stuff and try to sell you merch
 no content post launch only avatar stuff on a regular basis thats it this game is nothing like a fg anymore they are putting all resources into battle hub
 modern controls drains the fun of the game people just spamming special movesauto combos over and over making the gameplay really dull and unfun to play against its a great idea to introduce people into the game but it should be prohibited in rankedcompetitive play
 sf6 became an ad platform with all the collabs and ads for other companies in the game
 only 18 base characters the competition is way ahead of capcom for instance tekken 8 has 32 base characters and has free character customization the community complained about sf5s small base roster 16 characters but looks like nothing learned from past mistakes
 mobile game monetization you pay for a fully priced aaa game and you have to pay ridiculous amounts of money for dlcs like in a free to play game
 no communication with the community for feedbackfuture content literally blizzard 20
 1 year balance policy is very outdated it is like capcom is still stuck in 2008 feels like only 3 people working on it 23 infrequent balance patches in 1 year are the way to go
 famous influencers are shilling for this game and defending bad practices that is because they are getting invited to events etc by capcom and they want to stay in good terms with them 
 meta is defined by capcom there is no skill expression if you do not play the top tier broken characters youre getting steam rolled with the exception of being a 10year vet player
 only 4 characters are dlc in 1 year with such a tiny roster
 only 1 costume for the cast in the time frame of 1 year
 ultimatedeluxe edition gives you drive tickets which are basically useless you cant buy characters or outfits with it they fail to see the trend giving out premium currency like in other games
 some characters are so powerful that they are game breaking and completely bend the rules for example jp is supposed to be a zoner but hes stronger in midrange and closerange than rest of the cast as well and has for some reason aircommand grabs and defensive abilities that are unbeatable  the best buttons in the game with no hurt boxes his projectiles can hit highlow a mortal kombat character somehow made it into street fighter even some sponsors are telling pro players to play this character if they want to get sponsored
 no jukebox for all modes
 grapplers are just memebottom tier characters
 the only positive is the gameplay which is very fun

#####

denuvo needs to be trashed

#####

i bought this not that long ago upon the drm news uninstalled and never playing any capcom game ever again this is not the company i supported 

you can take your drm capcom and shove it up your ass

trust comes at a high cost

#####

give me back yor forger
what kind of collab is this just a skin and a ugly one
why i dont just download mods 

#####

the game is probably the best street fighter game you can get on steam this game emphasizes neutral poking gameplay rather than aggressive rush down youd really have to practice using drive rush to do any major damage in this game and it isnt as simple as street fighter 4s focus attack cancel the timing on the drive rush is much tighter and only can be done with certain normal attacks rather than special moves 

the main thing that i dont like about this game is that the monetization is really bad you have to grind in the world tour mode to unlock the secondary costume or pay 50 fight coins to unlock them and its per character rather than a bundle the pricing on the fight coins is pretty ridiculous 4999 for the largest fight coin package of 2750 coins the colors 39 is locked behind a sf 5 fight money mechanics called drive tickets 1 color costume bundle cost 315 coins or 7000 drive tickets 315 coins x18   5670 coins im pretty sure the monetization will just get worse and worse as this game continues

#####

adding drm to old titles that people purchased a decade ago braking mods no thx 

dont get me wrong they are switching out one drm for another but when you are actively going out of your way to deliver your paying customers a worse experience then pirating the game you are doing something very very wrong

#####

scummy pricing options for dlc

#####

first street fighter property i ever spent more than 2 hours playing incredibly fun fighting game that should be the starting franchise for anyone wanting to learn the fundamentals of fighting games

its hard to really give much of a review for the gameplay cuz like its street fighter lol spacing in this game will create a thick mist of tension between you and your opponent and as opposed to a lot of other popular new age fighting games youre not allowed to just run up at the start of the match nor will you be punished by having half of your hp be taken out in every single match only way that happens is if you get combod into a level 3 super which is incredibly unlikely to happen unless both characters hit each other enough to get both to 5 hp yea drive rush does speed up the pace of the game and kind of breach the footsies heavy style the series is known for but its not impossible to counter drive impacts do also seem incredibly daunting with their super armor properties but keep in mind that theyre easily countered by not only blocking unless youre in a corner jumping using a multihit that hits 3 times parrying or just doing a crouching light jab 3 times i can understand the frustration that comes with playing any game too much and getting frustrated with mechanics that arent yet staples of the series but arguing that it ruins the game is just ignorant

oh yea the cast not too much to say i like the variety and there isnt too much to say aside from that theres a lot of incredibly unique characters that fit into at least one persons preferred playstyle not only that theres like 4 charge characters a decent level of zoners some people like them idk like 4 grapplers and each kind of character plays entirely different from each other 
my only complaint is that im personally tired of seeing the world warriors at this point in the main roster sure e honda guile dhalsim are all classic characters that have been in every single game mainline game aside from third strike but speaking of third strike i just wish they did an incredibly huge overhaul of new characters and sure a fourth of the cast are new characters but there couldve seriously been more room for innovation or at least give us a single third strike character pleeeeease

oh yea and the online is amazing i play consistently agianst a friend in sweden while in california with probably a single second of lag from either of us once every 20 matches that i usually win

almost forgot about the single player mode its alright its not your general netherrealm games story rich cinematics fest its more of an rpg mode where you focus on doing the generic main story plenty of side quests interact with characters which you can befriend and give gifts to get some pretty cool rewards and just run around fighting random jobbers my main complaint is how its heavily focused on pushing you to spend more time grinding levels to even do damage to enemies feels lame when im in the final tournament of the story and having issues chipping away at the enemy for 2 of damage after every hit while im getting two shot after making a single mistake 
i like the idea they were going for but introducing a leveling system into a fighting game is a terrible thing to put into a genre entirely based on your personal skill

also the training mode and arcade modes are great arcade mode is arcade mode and training mode literally shows you frame information all single player content aside from world tour is amazing

so id seriously recommend the game for anyone who wants to play fighting games for what fighting games are or just want to get into learning fundamentals of the genre i feel intensely moderate towards world tour though so maybe just ignore its existence

#####

adding drm and trying to remove mods thats gotta be a no from me friendo

#####

best fighting game in recent years or perhaps maybe ever its a complete package that satisfies every competitor or casual players needs to have in a fighting game for the first time ever a fighting game was actually worthy to be priced at full due to its sheer scope  although the performance in world tour is unfortunate i still cant hold it against this game really theres always other content to explore

#####

developers knew exactly what they were doing with the female characters 1010 for the thiccness

#####

really really good game honest getting 2 rent tokens in first few tiers beveryb battle pass for trying out dlc characters for an hour before buying them is a great idea
world tour is okay you can meet future dlc characters in there without buying any its just fun

whats neither good okay or fun is monetization fighter coins currency are sold in such specific amounts you have to overpay to get anything good within the game and these coins are time limited they expire after 180 days
additionaly the issue with dlcs is nothing the stupid people in reviews are complaining about reading comprehension issue its that these dlc characters arent sold separately so you have to buy a whole pass to get them well there iisi a way to buy each character separately but only through aforementioned fighter coins
also the long awaited costumes arent even sold through steam these can only be acquired through these stupid coins
and i havent even spoken about the criminal prices for these things players are already paying 60 for the base game spending 30 more for a whole bundle of future characters already isnt very inviting thank goodness for rent tokens though especially since you cant buy them separately unless you go for these stupid fighter coins but to whip out 15 for a single crossover costume for the stupid player avatar and 12 worth in fighter coins which expire btwwhich you still have to overpay for to be able to buy any of them for a single character costume

for reasons named above im discouraged from purchasing anything the game offers besides its base content
and as much as these issues dont affect the main game this greedy business plan still should be criticized

again this is a really good game most balanced fighting game on release in a long while with attractive roster and multiple modes of gameplay but i wont leave a positive review for such repulsive monetization practice capcom already earns a lot through game sales alone the pricing on additional purchases and dirty approach to ingame currency are simply signs of corporate greed

#####

game ran perfectly on beta and now it runs like absolute shit whats the point of adding denuvo to a mostly online game fucking morons

#####

i like the funny drunk man

also real talk  i dont use it but im very glad modern controls are a thing they allow fgc newbies to get into the complex mindgames aspect of the game without having to wade through a lot of the stuff that is deemed as boring early on like combos and motion inputs

#####

scam players with manipulative currency with overpriced costumes and then deny anyone that wants to mod the game absolutely despicable

#####

i know this review is quite long but i just wanted to add as much insight as possible on a lot of fundamental issues the game has

the game itself is quite fun and capcom didnt need to be bullied into adding single player content this time though please add survival mode but i cannot in my right mind recommend this game with the absolutely vile monetization in place which will take up the bulk of this review

before i start for those not in the know the free currency is drive tickets and the premium currency is fighter coins

i received this game as a gift for christmas which i am very grateful for but it still angers me that a 60 game is this stingy with content thats been paid for 

  in previous games youd unlock colours by simply playing a bunch of matches in sf6 its either 1000 drive tickets or 50 fighter coins considering the smallest amount of coins you can purchase is 250 for 5 thats roughly an euro a colour alternatively you can spend 1000 fighter coins or 6300 drive tickets to get colours 39 for a specific character this applies to dlc characters too
  things get even more ridiculous with the second batch of costumes the first one was 50 fighter coins per costume which in the domain of costumes is passable though you can unlock those by playing world tour but the new ones are 300 50 less than the price of a character that means youll have to spend 1250 on 610 coins to even get one meaning youll always be left with leftover coins that youll have nothing to do with 

its absolutely abhorrent and inexcusable for a fully priced title from a giant company such as capcom these prices wouldnt be acceptable even if this was an mmo which it seems is what fighting games are desperately trying to be now if the last two mortal kombat games are any indication 

  to even acquire drive tickets you can do one daily mission and one weekly mission that gives you 500 each and its not even guaranteed that youll see a mission that gives out drive tickets this essentially means youll spend months grinding those just to maybe get a handful of things you want its even more insane if you plan on spending your tickets on the hub goods shop which sells costumes and quite frankly ugly pins for your avatar 

  said costumes show up for a limited time and can cost anywhere from 6000 to 8000 drive tickets and the individual costume pieces seem just so arbitrarily priced 4000 for one 2300 for another 1500 youll overtake the price of the entire costume in no time by buying individual parts 

  in world tour itself you cant even do the most basic level of customization changing colours on an article of clothing without grinding you have to grind for dyes from enemies and not even a single bottle per colour no if you want to make something red you need 5 bottles of the same colour its so pointless and unnecessary just give people a menu with a colour map its worked time and time again 

  on the top of infuriating aspects of world tour i cannot for the life of me understand why is it that i cant use special moves with the same directional input but different face buttons for example you cant use gladius quarter circle forward  punch and quadriga quarter circle forward  kick simultaneously the game will simply display a message as if youre trying to use two quarter circle punch moves simultaneously which means that if you want to dedicate yourself entirely to one characters style you just cant
 
so unless youre lucky and your favourite characters moves all have different inputs good luck mixing and matching with the dumb restriction that prevents you from doing so on a side note that flaw was so ridiculously apparent with jamie whose first two special moves that you learn both use quarter circle forward that it made me chuckle

despite what it may sound like i want to enjoy the things the game has to offer i really do its just really hard to do so when the game sweats bullets at the mere thought of allowing you to access the most basic of things without asking the player to fork over money or putting some bizarre twist on it

  also 30 for a season pass are you kidding me for four characters and a bunch of drive tickets yes they sneak drive ticket bonuses in the dlc now for a purchase incentive as if the abhorrent microtransactions werent insulting enough on the topic of dlc 70 for the soundtrack is also preposterous capcom often has overpriced soundtracks but this games is more expensive than even the game itself let that sink in 

  to somehow add even more insult to injury this game has a battle pass in a 60 game who knows why i am mentioning that so much 
it works about as youd expect tasks on a time limit to enslave your free time and force you to keep playing to not miss out on the goodies you spent your own money on to get a chance to grab even half the stuff or just pay more money to grab them including what i find most ridiculous which is earning yourself the ability to play classic capcom arcade games which you can do on the battle hub on rotation through a menu 
  you spend money to play the game so that you can have the ability to play other games through a menu option does that not sound absolutely insane it becomes even more asinine when you consider that theres at least three different ways you can permanently acquire said games without resorting to paying a ransom to capcom you can buy the individual collections that host those games and theres also the option of the arbitrarily separated capcom arcade stadiums 1st and 2nd if all you really want is to buy any of the games available on the battle hub permanently for prices between 1 or 2 hell capcom has even given away some of them in the past

a note about arcade mode i wish we could play the minigames through a menu as sf4 did and i appreciate the fact we can select to either do 5 or 12 matches although i wish arcade didnt feel like such a footnote as an example i played kens story hoping to get more insight into the details of him getting framed for terrorism and by the end of it i was left wholly unsatisfied since all that happens is ken pondering if hell kill jp for messing up his life or not but he doesnt get any closure does he decide to do it and feel like crap because he committed murder does he decide not to do it and have jp fix the mess he created as some sweet form of retribution does he do anything at all to change his current situation hell if i know the game sure doesnt and presents in a fashion that makes it seem as though it really couldnt care less to provide an answer for the answer youll have to read a comic

  about one of the only things i can praise in this game aside from the new mechanics and the changes made to some legacy characters that i personally enjoy even if most i found strange such as getting rid of zangief banishing flat special move is the controls theres finally a game that allows you to manually select different control options meaning that i who prefer classic inputs can play against my brother who prefers simpler modern inputs and we can both enjoy the game our own way this makes it so people who are less experienced with fighting gamesdont play them very often can enjoy the game without feeling like theyre being held back by the difficulty of memorizing the inputs 

  to close this bible sized review if youre planning on buying the game consider what i wrote above and check if the game is for you or if youre better off just playing with a friend that owns the game or playing any of the previous games in the series

game teaches you to never back down

#####

a solid fighting game wrapped in a terrible ecosystem and predatory monetisation that devalue the core game 

the product is overly focused on the battle hub at the expense of the actual game and ranked game play 

the ingame currency drive tickets is next to useless other than for buying costume colours and are mostly earnable via intolerable avatar battles 

drive tickets should at least be earnable via ranked wins and should be able to used to enable people buy their favourite colours and costumes even making costumes extremely drive ticket expensive would be acceptable  

in addition to this the battle hub lacks subregions making it laggy and unreliable in australia

the game engine seems to have poor antialiasing making hair look like a checker board fill even at 1440p

cosmetic dlc is absurdly priced and should not be supported by the community if you are considering buying all costume 3s first ask yourself does this provide the same value as another full priced aaa title that i could purchase instead

after such a good launch and community goodwill it is a pity to see capcom tarnish their reputation once again  i enjoy the game but have a hard time recommending this product to new players in its current state

#####

leaving a negative review because the skins being this high in price is unreasonable they applied a live service model to a 60 dollar game and that shouldnt fly anywhere 100 for the total of outfit 3 with others down the pipeline is unreasonable especially when they can make dlc characters for 25 at most the skins should have been 40 for blah blah blah inflation but this is running away with your wallets in a knapsack

the game is good and fun but the people running it are starting to get greedy again

dont let crapcom win keep them as capgods

#####

the game is ok but as for most first iteration fighting games it has its flaws

1 starting with full meter does not reward any archetype other then rushdown  characters that have exploitable flaws without meter simply never get put into that scenario with decent meter usage and it widens power levels between characters immensely  it seems that they didnt account for strength differences in ex moves either because you have some characters who can really only use ex moves in combos while others are getting massive plus frames and resets off of them  it also allows for di rush whenever so characters who have long cancelable normals are constantly osing it to get in and be plus or get massive damage off them  meter also is gained passively over time and resets to 100 between rounds which encourages people to use massive amounts of it every round  almost all the issues that i have with this game can be traced back to this basic issue

2 drive impact warps games  its existence in the game basically removes the ability to poke with non cancel able normal in its range because you can just mash di on reaction and get a full punish it also travels absurdly far forwards which helps in the above  other then that it seems to serve very little purpose because its fully react able to

3 drive impact rush makes pressure absurd and zoning nearly impossible  basically any time any character lands a cancel able normal they can spend 50 and go in for a massive combo or be plus in your face  it also has a very easy os that has no risk at all  not only that if you cancel a move from it very fast you get this slide property which carries certain characters incredibly far to the point they can punish a projectile thrown from full screen with a knockdown  there is no way to use this mechanic defensively so characters who like poking get screwed or are forced to rushdown  it also costs literally nothing when not done in a true blockstring and makes the next hit positive so characters are constantly throwing out normally unsafe sweeps or moves to get in because they arent punishable anymore

4  the game has incredibly poor universal defensive mechanics  you are forced to use 50 on the games universal defensive get off me tool which is both slow and unsafe on block  throw loops are back and characters without aa dps are taking constant true 5050s on every hit due to di rush and stupid strong pressure while parry does exist its strengths do not outweigh how bad standing up is in this game

its not the worst game ever and its definitely not unplayable  but in its current iteration the game is far too rushdown heavy for a street fighter game for me  it honestly feels like an unpolished anime fighter when you arent playing a top tier

edit
after posting this review multiple true instant burnout combos on block and hit have been found and multiple infinite blockstrings during burnout  i sincerely hope capcom does some major changes before this game gets broken even further

#####

this was a rare chance for capcom to return to form and in terms of gameplay and netcode they have certainly hit their stride however their monetization strategy is very poor to say the least

#####

the gameplay itself is good but the game as a whole is handled horribly on so many levels

one patch a year keeps the meta stale for casuals and competitors alike better hope the top tiers are fun to play against dumbass 

predatory monetization practices sfv seems generous in comparison only getting a pass bc the game is liked more than mk

large but bland roster saving the cast of alpha and 3 for dlc seems scummy since those are the actually interesting ones world warrior boomers get btfod

the music sucks horrible they traded quality for readable in streams

one smaller thing is that it really sucks that the story was finally advanced past 3 just to not really do anything with it in service of the world tour mode using an oc sfv set up several different plot threads for 6 to continue but go completely unmentioned and will likely never get picked up again 

im sure itll get better over time like v but man i just dont ever feel myself wanting to come back which is sad

#####

 online netcode lobbies battle hub
 training mode
 overall quality of life features

 gameplay is a very mixed bag neutral skip mechanics like drive impact and drive rush are not fun for me
throw loops are maybe a necessity because of how powerful drive parry is but that doesnt make it fun either
every cancellable poke leading to a drive rush combo with bonus corner carry for top tiers normalizes the playstyles in a very boring way single noncancellable pokes usually heavies are discouraged by the threat of drive impact
the character toolkits are richer than in sf5 but sf6 is a system heavy game which kinda dampens this aspect
people rightfully complained in sf5 about
 plus frames on vtrigger activations which was done once per round usually but now with parry drive rush into plus frames buttons you can do it to your hearts content especially by characters like deejay ken and juri
 fireball into vtrigger activations now you can do these as many times as your drive gauge allows looking at you chun li guile
not a fan of sprinkling the characters with advancing normals either it cheapens the spacing game

 the roster is meh the newcomers are either uninteresting designs or with very polarizing gameplay or both
honda blanka why are they in the game at all are more annoying than ever some of the developers must truly hate the playerbase when they gave blanka safe balls a command grab and an install super with more safe balls

 character design and artstyle of the game sits in the uncanny valley of stylized realism not a fan of this middle of the road approach the washed out palettes and chromatic aberration in this game doesnt help either the colours are muted and not lively compared to previous sf games because of this the game looks worse than usual when compressed for streamingyoutube screen readability is also not very good during drive rushdrive impact

 music is for the most part stupefyingly bad sounding like bad mashups or commercial break tunes with no direction or pull the dad rap feels toothless and datedanachronic unlike the rap coupled with junglednb music used in 3rd strike which was an authentic musical timecapsule of its time we dont even need to go that far in the series since sf5s music was also modern and really well crafted

 default colors and storymode costume locked behind grinding story mode drive tickets or paywall

hard to recommend this game considering the above but at the same time it has a vibrant scene and a very active playerbase i hope the game will improve in future seasons and add more interesting characters until then i will just play other street fighters i enjoy mainly usf4 and alpha2

#####

remember the days when you unlock the whole roster just by playing the game

#####

4090 12900k and 32gb of ddr5 installed on an ssd

good game but cant recommend on principle right now the game drops frames and spikes in frametime every time a knockout is registered this is not present on the xbox series s or x i shouldnt be getting a less polished product than a 300 console

#####

what are these prices

#####

mommy juri mommy mommy juri han feet mommy juri feet mommy mama momma goo goo ga ga

#####

i can play someone across the globe and its playable fun gameplay mechanics that take the best of the series  actually has a stable launch and content unlike sfv

yeah this is a capcom w they really know how to make games again ever since re7

#####

an awesome game unfortunately blighted by microtransactions currencies paywalls season passes and predatory pricing

the tournament system also makes no effort to do any sort of serious matchmaking people smurf all the time and it really ruins the experience for people who are new to the series which is a huge downside considering that this game is trying to be more accessible to newcomers otherwise

#####

where do i begin

i love everything about this game from its soundtracks to game modes and the hit feedbacks as well as art design and progress system in world tour

everything about it is right

cant wait to see what more capcom has to offer throughout the lifespan of street fighter 6

jump on people its a great game

#####

#####

do not play this game

enigma drm is malware several reputable antivirus companys show keyloggers trojans etc in their panic to remove moddabillity capcom has opened their consumers up to being maliciously attacked and their data stolen do not play until enigma drm is gone for your own sake

#####

i freakin suck at this game

i love it

#####

new standard for fighting game offerings feels great in almost every way

#####

update with rashid monetization is even worse they dont let you buy the character as a standalone dlc with a fixed price you have to go through his ridiculous economy and microntransaction bullshit to buy the character where is the catch you cant obtain the coins necesary to buy rashid without getting more than the amount you need you need 350 fighter coins and the game only let you buy 250 500 or 610 so if you buy 500 coins you will be paying 10 and getting the value of 7ish dollarseuro that is the cost of the character i dont know if when you buy the character this way you get all colours if you dont then the characters and all the colors are 12ish dollars wtf capcom

matchmaking is kinda broken it only match you with people near you like a country near when the netcode can makes you play with almost an entire continent

world tour is boring repetitive and looks bad runs very bad and doesnt have a good story

the monetization is kinda bonkers you need to pay 105 to get all colours for all characters and for the classic costumes you either pay 20 ish  or waste around 1620 hours in world tour doing grindy minigames just to buy presents for the mentors and we havent even seen the battle pass monetization and future characterscostumesstages prices the games is 60 and have 4 currencies in game wtf and at least one of it is premium all this is disguised in an ingame store so they dont get the backlash they got in re4 remake for putting 80 of dlc day1

season pass is 30 the same that last sfv premium pass the diference is sf6 pass is 4 characters and sfv premium pass was 6 characters 15 costumes and 2 stages wanna know how much is sf6 premium pass 50 is almos the entire game for 4 characters 12 costumes and 2 stages

servers are very unstable this monday i couldnt play any games because rankeds were not functioning and then nothing was working only the boring avatar battles where you win if you grinded world tour more

ah i almost forgot they put denuvo in 1 day before release making people who could play betas and demos unplayable for them stupid ass decision in a pvp online based enviroment
