as a mom of five i have very little gaming time  the fact that i have played this 350 hours speaks volumes  the levels are awesome and challenging  the workshop makes for neverending fun

#####

i really disliked train valley the first of its name i was definitely on board train jokes choo choo with the basics of the gamepuzzling out efficient little routes fires up the part of my brain that has a decent chance of getting real into model trains when im older but the gimmick of the predecessor was delivering colour coded passengers between stations most levels were timed and new stations would appear on the map without warning throwing quite the wrench into your rail network it was a stressful gameplay loop so i gave up on train valley very very quickly

but much later on a weird whim i decided to give train valley 2 a try and see if it was a little bit less anxiety inducing you may have guessed already based on my hours of playtime but this turned out to be a fantastic idea train valley 2 still has the puzzling rail network aspect of the first game but by switching the focus from passenger to freight it neatly solves all of my lingering issues from the first game

now instead of random colours and getting got by surprise stations train valley 2 makes you lay out the infrastructure for supply chains sending out workers to produce goods using those goods to produce better goods and then bringing them back to the city by the end you choose when to launch a train you can focus on what you need to and aside from a few gimmicks in later levels the difficulty is entirely in your hands thanks to this its so much more fun to manage

so i ended up cruising through all fifty levels and a bunch of awesome workshop levels to boot youd think itd get old eventually but every map has unique layouts and occasional gimmicks to keep you on your toes like expanding obstacles customs checkpoints and my personal favourite the dreaded long train some of these maps end up ridiculously complicated by the end but thanks to the relaxed goals of the game its easy to progress but still a challenge to finish a level with 5 stars proper

so yeah i was pretty blown away by how much train valley 2 improved on its concept taking a game i actively disliked and producing a game i was completely obsessed with for the last two weeks you could say my low expectations were completely derailed choo choo

updated review a


first read the original review
tv2 is a great game but after about level 20 or so it stops being fun and starts being work 

this is a shame as the game was quite a bit of fun in the earlier stages

i still recommend the game to those who dont mind the funtocost ratio

for me it took about 30 hours to reach level 20 or so and i really enjoyed that 30 hours if the game had ended there i would have been happy with the value for 13 on sale

i reached a level with a tesla coil that randomly destroys tracks and at that point i felt the fun was gone and i uninstalled the game

for me this is still a recommendation to others maybe youll get farther than i did

 end of original review 
ok so above we established that the game was well worth the price even if you stop at level 20

i eventually got the itch to go back and try again  im happy to say that after the tesla coil level many of the other levels go back to normal overall there are 50 included levels which is really quite a lot

i ended up finishing all 50 levels and i went back and replayed many of them multiple times to get 5 stars on each to unlock all the engine upgrades

since then ive made heavy use of the workshop levels  these are levels created by fans of the game and new ones are added all the time  if youve never used workshop content before it couldnt be easier  train valley 2 has an interface right in the game  you dont even need to exit to steam to browse the available levels

this game delivers above and beyond value for the asking price and i think the puzzle nature of it will appeal to lots of people  not just those who like trains

#####

create goods via different stations that rely on each other good gameplay supported by a friendly community 

h2solve the puzzle h2
every level is a puzzle several towns require goods in order to finish the level those towns  produce workers which are required in most crafting stations for instance if the town needs glass you first send workers to a sand excavation station there workers are converted into sand over time the sand then is transported to the glass factory along with a new supply of workers finally the glass is transported to the town the ratio is always 11 so before you start the level you can calculate how many workers need to go where 
aside from finishing the level there are goals to earn stars stars unlock locomotive skins and achievements only three stars are awarded for beating the level in three margins of time and two times one star is awarded for variable goals such as not stopping trains or not arriving at wrong stations unless you crash the final product the times are never an issue the other goals can be tricky when you finish a level with five stars your ingame time money left and realtime time is compared to other players as a percentage 

h2community created levels  lets play together h2
besides the 50 levels from the base game there is a large community publishing levels in the steam workshop it works pretty well 

the developers organise a weekly competition for the community they nominate a level from the community and the players compete for the fastest ingame time usually between 70150 join in on the competition the top three and several random players are rewarded a physical card via the oldskool mail if they want i have received one such card and its a very nice idea all this is done via discord its too bad this is not completely done via the game itself but this is probably a resource and infrastructure issue 

h2my time with tv2h2
when i started the game i was very confused from tv1 i learned to spam the trains as fast as possible from the stations this game is totally different which i knew in the back of my mind the first reception of the game back when it launched was also confused if you liked the first game that can be a thing however i do applaud the devs for choosing a unique path 
level design is very good there is a lot of variety in levels some have a script to alter the layout during playing fifty levels is guaranteed to provide many hours of entertainment 
the community is one of the friendliest on steam my tv2 discord is always open they only give an alert when a new challenge is issued 

now some discomforts i have noticed 
 sometimes when you switch tracks you hear the switch sound but the tracks dont change 
 in some angles the exits of the stations arent visible or selectable the levels in the game avoid these situations but you can encounter player made levels that didnt avoid this situation 
 the game registers releasing of mousebuttons instead of mouseclicks i find this weird i even reinstalled tv1 to check and that one does respond to clicks 
 the scoring is very vague i wish it was just a scoreboard furthermore i would love to see a combination of ingame time and money left both are indications of efficiency while a combination would make it more complicated it would make it more interesting i think 
games i enjoy and play thoroughly always make me more involved and critical so in a way its good to have these 

i enjoyed my playthrough very much and i will stick around for the lets play togethers this sale i will get the dlc that adds passengers to the game good to mention that the dlc is not required to play levels of the community with elements of the dlc 
i can also recommend tv1 a very different game but equally good

i played train valley a few years ago and i really enjoyed it naturally i got excited about the second installment i wanted more of what the first game offered so i was a bit sceptical since train valley 2 seemed quite different from the first game but after having invested 150 hours i can with good conscious say that this is the superior game instead of the send the blue train to the blue station gameplay it became more of a time and resource management game where you have to harvest resources and manufacture products and then deliver the goods to the right stations when i was rolling through the first set of levels i jokingly told my friends that it is a baby game jokes on me its not as you progress the levels begin to look very intimidating and complex and some of them take a good few hours to complete flawlessly after i completed all the levels and achievements i got that bittersweet feeling when you finish a really good game or book it is the perfect combination of challenge and relaxation

#####

first thing first i dont really say you should avoid train valley 2 but i think you should be aware of a few things specially if youre coming from the first game train valley 2 is a beautiful game where you can see how much love has been put crafting those levels one by one with some nice lowpoly models a great amount of levels and now a level editor that i still need to try the community around it as well as the first usercrafted levels seems very promising and offering an endless possibility of levels to boost the lifetime of the game

but
more doesnt mean better
it feels like the things train valley 2 got in terms of content it lost it in terms of fun creativity and even challenge or is it just me who played too much already like instead of building on top of the strong foundations of the first game they decided to reinvent train valley

i really liked the first train valley because it was simple yet hard to master at first and there was a real sense of progression through the levels levels which really had their own personality with different trains different environments different music theme here it feels like theyre almost all the same with more or less the same difficultysome specific buildings are different but otherwise its mostly a pack of lowpolys with the same music in the background and god i love lowpoly so far theres no night environments for example and overall they dont have much personality

and what happened to the special event levels  the rocket the big train it was the best levels from the first one putting you under pressure sometimes or with a strange challenge or storytelling and the few ones in train valley 2 just feel like a level with a twist panama but no real challenge added in terms of pace or anticipation still panama a little

and wheres the creativity in train valley i took screenshots of my levels because i was proud of the way i made the tracks connect or cross each other in some kind of maze to send the proper train to the proper station it didnt have all those huge fancy levels yet it felt more creative in the way you crafted your lines the somehow random appearances of new stations made you think twice before building something and the randomness in the destination of the trains appearing in stations really made things more interesting
in train valley 2 its justbland planning theres still mistakes to make crashes but youre in control of the whole thing you are the one sending trains everywhere why did they took that away the random aspect of it i dont get it

levels are bigger you can build bridges and tunnels yet it feels like theres less options to where you can actually build your tracks as levels are already so full of details with the terrain giving more constraint in terms of creativity than offering a real challenge there isnt dozen options to connects elements and you pretty quickly figure the only real optimized option

on the interface side im also not a big fan of the changes it still an earlyaccess so i kind of hope some improvements will be done in terms of lisibility and the way you can identify your objectives but right now the icons system for me doesnt work i always struggle at the beginning of a new level to identify the main stations with workers and spend a lot of time in pause mode to identify where i should go first because theres way too much information on the map to me the difference between the building asking or providing resources isnt that obvious and doesnt really help your planning where the color system of the first train valley was so efficient

in the end im curious to see where the final game will go as its still in earlyaccess but i dont see them rewritingrebuilding the whole first 30 levels available before the expected release at the end of march ill keep playing the game levels and i need to try the community levels and the editor maybe the true level gems lay there hidden

what do you think

#####

h1tldr  great sequel love ith1

i bought train valley 1 because totalbiscuit described it as primarily a micromanagement game

i found that summary very interesting and it turned out to be correct very engaging gameplay that primarily consisted of trying to get everything where it needed to go as quickly as possible and without having anything crash into anything else

train valley 2 improves on the original primarily by letting you know exactly how many supplies need to travel from every point to every other point and hands you control of when trains will  be scheduled for departure from each station this allows you to plan ahead and micromanage more precisely 

it also feels more fair  no longer does a train suddenly need to go to a very inconvenient place at short notice youve been given virtually all the information there is to give and complete responsibility for success or failure rests on your shoulders there are absolutely no random elements to be found as far as im aware

another change which i consider an improvement is that stars are no longer earned and tracked in isolation  you get a total number of stars for each level that is recorded no more throwaway runs because you need to earn a particular star that is fully incompatible with the others

train valleys 2 largest flaw which it shares with its predecessor is that the tutorial is hot garbage having to x each prompt makes them feel like popups strikeand theres no option to disable the prompts after you understand the gamesstrike the upside of this is that the systems arent at all difficult to learn through experimentation

overall this is already a great followup to the original and i look forward to watching its development

edit you can now skip the tutorial which disables the prompts

#####

this is possibly the alltime greatest train puzzle game that has ever been made  train valley was good  but train valley 2 should be used at board meetings to teach how sequels should be done   

there is a lengthy campaign you can whizz through to finish but more likely than not youll want to go back repeat levels and fulfil all the conditions and achieve the full star rating    but where this game truly excels is in the community workshop  theres thousands of great maps with some truly exceptional creators making content as good if not better than the original designers     simple game mechanics make for some incredibly complex and high pressure puzzle solving or you can just chill out on a more casual level and do your choo choo thing shutting out the outside world problems like rent jobs stupid trainhating ex girlfriends and so on   when i first bought this game i had just started studying a masters in accountancy     i used to get emails from the uni  the alerts can be distracting so close your browser because now none of that mattersonly choo chooonly choo choo

#####

great game with simple game play
i played it with my 5 yo son and he loves it and is able to play the game with some assistance
this is a good game fun for young and old nice visuals too
and a big kudos to the developer for the linux port

#####

in the first part train valley 1 you had to connect train stations to one another to satisfy the basic requirement
here that concept is gone and instead employing a method where you carry workers to industries then the industries goods to either a town or other industries now the goal in train valley 2 is to try and deliver all the necessary goods within time limit if you satisfied the other bonus requirements if you hit the time mark then you will get 5 star the level

also in train valley 2 there is a wider variety of locomotives and cars that can be used than in train valley 1
before you had to wait for bridges and tunnels to be constructed by the map before being able to use them while in train valley 2 you can build your own bridges and tunnels

the maps are also bigger overall and maps that are featured in this game often include something unique to make the situation more challenging in some maps you need to deliver goods to cities in a certain order to complete the level

also levels difficulty varies as you go along some level could feel harder than the next one

my thought of train valley 2 

if you liked train valley 1 you will also enjoy in train valley 2 it is a good puzzlestrategy game that is satisfying to finish just like train valley 1 and very big plus is that there is the workshop where you can play other peoples stuff

i have many youtube video reviews of many trains oriented games on my gaming youtube channel

#####

i enjoyed the first train valley and decided to give the sequel a shot this is without a doubt the lengthiest review ive ever posted on steam but in short i like the game a lot

h1 differences in tv1 and tv2 h1

in the original you had to connect train stations to one another to satisfy the basic requirement of x train needs to go to y station fairly straightforward but could get very chaotic if you slacked off or did not build the optimum route to start or end with

here that concept is gone instead employing a method that was seen in chris sawyers locomotion one of my alltime favorite games and is on steam worth checking out where you carry workers to industries then the industries goods to either a town or other industries the goal is now to try and deliver all the necessary goods within a par time limit assuming you satisfied the other bonus requirements if you hit the par time mark then youll 5star the level

also in this one is a wider variety of locomotives and cars that can be usedseen before there wasnt a whole lot of variety but now you have different freight cars for coal copper grain iron ore steel gold ore gold bars etc one thing i am a little miffed about is the fact that locomotives you can unlock in the same tier dont really provide any bonus i wished theyd at least have a little speed boost which could help you if you needed to go back and complete earlier levels

before you had to wait for bridges and tunnels to be constructed by the map before being able to use them now you can build your own bridges and tunnels if the map permits it makes things a lot easier

the maps are also bigger overall i dont know the exact size difference but i can assure you that some of them can get up to 23x bigger than the old tv1 maps


h1 maps  difficulty h1

the maps that are featured in this game often include something unique to make the situation more challenging for instance siberia has teslas factory randomly destroy bits of track everysooften that youll need to repair maeklong and others have timed released trains that youll need to account for when making your next move panama has the area flood gradually over time which forces you to reroute you trains as time goes on in some maps you need to deliver goods to cities in a certain order to complete the level all this creates unique situations that keep the game from getting boring

the maps themselves look pretty good as a guy who has played locomotion roller coaster tycoon 1 and rct 2 i can say im a fan of isometricstyled games and tv2 is no exception levels feel much more vibrant than in tv1 and with more unique rolling stock as discussed previously things look much better 

i will take issue with the time requirements for some of the levels sometimes a level can feel just too hard to finish quickly  i also think that the levels difficulty varies as you go along one level could feel harder than the next one perhaps its just me so ill let you think on this one 

h1 final thoughts h1

if you liked tv1 youll enjoy tv2 could it be better absolutely does that mean this game sucks nope all in all its a good puzzlestrategy game thats satisfying to finish just like tv1 and if you get bored of the games levels theres always the workshop where you can play other peoples stuff

#####

i loved the first train valley for its challenge aspect but thats all gone in the sequel train valley 2 has moved towards a resource transportation simulator and the pressure and challenge is gone it has the same look and feel but the gameplay is not the same as the first i applaud that they branched out and went with something new but personally for me its a miss

thtable
 
is this game a masterpiece no but it is still rather good and relaxing

a nice puzzletime management game where you have to build rail tracks with limited ressources and then send workers and items to where they are required to earn money each of the 50 levels during 5 stages of the industrial revolution is completed when you deliver the requested goods but this gives you only 15 stars to receive more stars you have to beat the clock and reach some other goals depending on the level which can be rather challenging

you are required to micromanage your trains order them to leave the train stations stop or reverse them and operate all track switches manually when two trains crash the cargo is lost and you have to repair the trains and the tracks costing you time and money this is not really a train company management sim but you can upgrade your trains to transport more goods or drive faster one really strange thing is that you can send a train from a to b and then immediately again from a to anywhere even though the train should be physically in b

you can make your own levels with a level editor or download user levels with the steam workshop integration

ub conclusionbu
wellmade puzzler in lowpoly graphic and with little trains driving around

#####

train valley 2 a strategy  management sim in which you build your own network of rails and trains and try to pass delivery goals as quick as you can    
    
ubgameplaybu   
you start of every level with a set amount of money and trains you have to use your funds wisely to build your first tracks and manually send out trains to start the production of goods at first workers that will be generated at your starting location or multiple ones later in the game need to be transported to the production facilities to bring them to life and earn you some money so you can extend your rail network to connect new production facilities and transport materials to them to craft the items needed to finish the level each train with workers or material that arrives at its destination ears you cash which can be used for new rails trains or train upgrades    
      
ubpros and cons bu
pros
50 levels in different epochs 
increasing difficult and complexity 
different challenges and time limits in each level to earn max rating which increases the replayability and gives motivation to perfect your strategy and management
multiple working solutions for each level
the developers hold events regularly on specially designed challenge maps which are free to download and feature the winners in a news post
level editor and steam workshop support
   
cons
no automation which wouldnt work in this game but if you look for something like factorio you wont become happy with train valley 2 

ubgraphic and audiobu
the game has a charming low poly graphic style which gives each level its own charm i personally enjoy the stylized graphics of the game a lot but it surely isnt for everyone  
train valley 2 features a relaxing soundtrack that supports the game well but wont distract you from thinking about the solution for the level the trains have charming sound that wont become obnoxious even in extended playtime sessions
   
ubtechbu
i experienced no crashes or stutters so far 
   
ubfinal thoughtsbu
train valley 2 is a great management sim that eases you well into its gameplay and explains its systems well you never get thrown into a new challenging situation without knowing what the tools you have to solve it do the difficult curve is well designed and increase at a good pace from the levels i played i never felt like they were unfairly designed and the extra nonmandatory challenges in each level give you a lot of motivation to go back and try it again till you can reach the max rating especially since you can unlock new skins for your trains once you reached a certain amount of stars  


#####

500 hours and the game hasnt even been released yet

well what can i say train valley is about connecting train stations and productions sending out trains earning money and upgrading trains in the most efficient way so if you like graphs time management games planning games then you might truly fall in love with this one

there will be 50 official levels upon release but the true gem are the hundreds of community levels and if you love the game you can make and share your own creations using a very user friendly editor all in all you can expect to have hundreds of hours of fun with this game

to me train valley is just one of those games that has to exist and i hope that the devs will produce tv34567 etc in the upcoming years this game prinicple has huge potential

in general the developer support is phenomenal issues bugs questions and suggestions are listened to and addressed the community too is fun and great to be around

really interested to see where the devs take this one

#####

superficially very similar to train valley 1 but the new supplydemand system transforms the game to something quite different shifting the focus away from dealing with whatever random train destinations are thrown at you to carefully planning how to develop your train network and dispatch trains in advance only dislike so far is some of the nonsense objectives like deliberately make 5 trains crash

#####

h1introductionh1
train valley 2 is the sequel to 2015s wellreceived train valley by a trio of developers and published by flazm

the original train valley was a casual puzzle game in which the goal of each level was to route a certain number of trains between different coloured stations while maintaining a positive bank balance and optionally meeting a number of secondary goals

while train valley 2 retains the levelbased approach of its parent this sequel changes the formula significantly each level now requires the player to route a small fleet of trains between various stations in order to create production goods required in the target cities blurring the line between the casual puzzle style of the original and a sort of light tycoon strategy game

h1presentationh1
train valley excelled in its presentation graphics were crisp and colourful with plenty of life and expanded with little animations and flourishes music was cool and casual more jazz than elevator music and a joy to listen to unfortunately the sequel seems to have gone backwards

graphics have been updated to full 3d but the developers have taken a deliberately minimalist lowpoly approach while theyre clean and nothing to complain about on their own when compared with the earlier game they just seem lacking in character each train and production station is nicely animated and looks good and there are some nice extra touches again like birds flying about but it seems to lack the life of the first game the vibrancy and personality is just  gone its a bit like eating cheese made from pasteurised milk it works but its lacking in flavour theres also no way to rotate the camera so its still possible to get signalsswitches behind other objects making them hard to use or even see

music is well produced and nice but its not as lively and enjoyable the first games soundtrack seemed more varied and great to listen to but this feels a bit like being stuck in an elevator the endless musak playing eternally in the background once again its not bad just bland sound effects are fine i never felt they were a highlight before and theyre not here either but they do the job

the interface is minimal and clean but some button clicks appear to be ignored i encountered this in the first game too needing to click two or three times on the speed controls for example to get one to register i dont know if its a bug in the interface or maybe the hitboxes arent quite right but in either case it can be a bit frustrating when things start to go wrong 

performance is mostly good on my gtx1070based gaming laptop but a couple of times a level the game freezes for a second or two for no obvious reason

h1gameplayh1
while the players interactions in train valley 2 remain basically the same as in its predecessor  build tracks between stations click on stations to send out trains and click on switches at track intersections to direct trains on desired paths  the core gameplay and goals have actually changed significantly

gone are the bankruptcy coloured stations extra train button and train pressure gauge replaced by a small train fleet productionline manufacturing and time limits the last of which form three of the five stars that can now be earned for each level the other two stars are optional goals similar to the first game theres also building of bridges and tunnels which is a welcome addition but limited in scope

the goal of each level is to satisfy the production requirements for each city on the map you begin with a smallish cash pool and one or more cities requiring goods six units of furniture and five of jewellery might be required in one city while 12 cows and 8 wooden boards might be needed in another placed around the rest of the map youll then see production stations of the various tiers to which you need to send trains full of workers from the cities to begin production once you have the basics going cash becomes much less important and you can always send extra worker trains about to earn cash

higher tiers require lowertier goods as well as workers so producing the five units of jewellery might require gold ore and coal to make gold bars as well as sand and coal to make glass the gold bars and glass would then have to be transported to the jewellery factory to produce the jewellery each of those steps requires five workers so all up you might need 35 workers some of these requirements change as you progress through the levels but the basic idea is the same each time

the game begins with a series of tutorial popups explaining the very basics of game play as you play more and unlock features some of these are explained with extra popups too but not all for example the questions of how you appropriate funds why trains turn around in some stations whether train upgrades and fleet increases carry over between levels or whether the unlocked locomotives do anything differently are not answered anywhere thats not a critical failing but since the popup functionality exists a more complete description of these game elements would have been great even having played the original train valley very recently it still took me a while to work out just what was going on in some of these situations

do well enough and youll unlock upgrades to your locomotives but i think these are only aesthetic upgraded train fleets arent carried over between levels so theres no real feel of progression either less a campaign than a series of discrete levels much like the first game but with the feeling there should be more

the conversion of workers into components at each station seems exceptionally silly to me why does a train full of workers turn into coal wood or grain what happens to the workers do they quit or is workplace safety so lacking that they end up in the goods
is my jewellery made of compressed worker are the cows actually eating the workers and why do produced resources need to be transported but the trains themselves can be anywhere at the click of a button

also silly but a holdover from the previous game is the way in which trains can stop on tracks and turn on the spot i would have liked to have seen this removed from the sequel

all of these things reduce the appeal as a tycoon game it seems to me like more than the casual puzzle game of its predecessor but not quite enough to be an enjoyable simulation game its a sort of tycoonlite add the time constraints and the 50 levels that at least from the half or so that ive seen all feel basically the same and it seems like a game that doesnt quite know what it wants to be

h1pros and consh1
pros
thoughtful extensions to train valley

cons
presentation isnt as vibrant
gameplay is longwinded and repetitive
time limits

h1verdicth1
the original train valley was fun the level times suited the amount of free time i typically have for gaming and the gradual build up of difficulty worked well the great music and little graphical touches were the icing on the cake it looked and sounded great

train valley 2 feels like a step sideways if not backwards im only about half way through it and it feels like a chore though the productionline style is quite well done each level feels the same as the last the timelimits are also a definite turnoff for me and it seems easier than its predecessor  i havent lost a level yet since theres no bankruptcy  while also being much longerwinded the graphics and music arent as personable as the earlier games either making the experience even less engaging

its not a bad game and i can see why others might enjoy it more than its predecessor but i dont find it as fun to play

h1tldrh1
this is ultimately a puzzle game disguised as a tycoon game buy if you believe youll enjoy micromanaging trains to meet tight deadlines and solve puzzles in time management
h1the gameh1
the first thing thatll strike you about train valley 2 tv2 is that its some kind of transportation simulator along the lines of transport tycoon deluxe openttd simutrans factorio etc etc bthis is not trueb tv2 is a game where you are mostly a train idispatcheri and must maintain extreme focus to ensure trains need to go where they need to go so you can meet the levels objectives in the amount of time you are given speaking as someone who has 5starred every level the base game  passenger dlc this is not a super chill experience it is hard and you must maintain high levels of efficiency by precisely micromanaging yet also be able to follow several trains of thought pun intended at once ultimately there are two games you are playing at once the game of building your tracks to connect the network the puzzle part and the game where you must manage the trains on that network

if you do not like stressful highintensity games involving micromanagement of several different processes at once you will hate train valley 2 if you are someone like me who loves games like that you will likely find train valley 2 to be one of your favourite games
h2what about train valley 1h2
if you havent seen or played train valley 1 youre probably wondering if you should get that one instead of this one frankly this game stands on its own there is no actual plot to train valley and this is less of a sequel to the previous game than an entire revamp of the mechanics in the first game you mainly focus on passengers connecting them from point to point and managing a network that doesnt really have any levels as such in train valley 2 the focus is on cargo and the aspect of supply chains where certain industries require goods from other industries add far more depth to the dispatching than the first game had yet also means the gameplay is very different bget this game if its between this and tv1b
h1what i thoughth1
as ive said before train valley 2 strives to be one of those micromanagement games where you must maintain concentration throughout i would say train valley 2 fulfills this goal perfectly every level is difficult yet generally not absurdly so the level of challenge can be infuriating sure but i never felt like anything was total bs the game is entirely fair and i always felt as if it was my skill at issue rather than anything such as rng or game design problems that isnt to say you wont lose due to missing some minor detail but you have complete control at all times over the levels and all minor details are immediately visible to the player you will constantly have to restart levels if youre chasing 5 stars but the levels are short enough that while restarting is a punishment its not an absurd punishment like in other games featuring permadeath

in terms of difficulty spikes id say i only got truly stuck on 10 of the levels in tv2 typically the ones that involved making a certain amount of money since that would entail planning further in advance than i liked these were not absurdly high difficulty spikes at odds with the rest of the game these levels generally took me about twice as long to complete as the levels i found to be easier  

on a few other notes the art style game is cute and toylike at odds with the level of difficulty more on the level of dark souls its a funny contrast and the general art  design of the levels is both a significant improvement from train valley 1 yet is also good enough to stand on its own right the steam workshop also allows one to get endless highquality playermade levels if one breallyb likes train valley 2 and wants to play even more of it 
h1the verdicth1
i thoroughly enjoyed this game and it is probably one of the best in the chaotic micromanagement genre exemplified by games such as overcooked amazing difficult and one of my favourite games it and its dlc are definite buys even if you havent played train valley 1

#####

the fun goes away around level 25 the layouts and increasing complexity of frsutrating terrain makes levels tedious instead of interesting they start averaging around 45 minutes per level the effort vs reward doesnt line up

really good puzzle game different mechanics from the first part different strategies to finish the level still very addictive to play you can play leisurely by your own pace or take the challenge and finish all objectives in a given time which i preferred the most it can be really frustrating if you lose by few seconds but also very rewarding if you finish in time levels are finely tuned you dont have to brainstorm much to get all objectives

as for the dlcs  i liked passenger flow in which they combined mechanics from the tv1 and tv2 again everything is tuned fine like in the base game on the other hand myths and rails dlc is super hard compared to previous 70 levels you need to have very precise tactics in order to get the objectives i didnt like that shift in complexity but maybe someone will

all in all big recommendation for the game

#####

i loved the first game so i was excited for the sequel i cant stand it
the first game was peaceful almost purely about solving the puzzle of how to lay your rails so trains can get to their destination i dont recall time mattering for anything other than bragging rights this game is the exact opposite figuring out the best track layout is very straightforward the entire challenge comes from racing against the clock optimizing your train deployments and maximizing your apm like its an rts if youre sitting back and watching the trains run youre probably falling behind and wasting time
 usually a single mistake means you have to start over from scratch either from failing an objective or guaranteeing youll miss the time limit and the monotony of rebuilding the same initial track configuration for the 15th time quickly gets to you  
if you enjoy the feeling that you shouldve finished your current task before even starting it this is the game for you if you want a relaxing trainskinned puzzle game check out train valley 1

#####

ive had enough of these bad levels where i spend an hour doing everything i am supposed to only to have to start over because of one mistake or worse some form of troll mechanic that cant be foreseen

other levels are locked behind the levels i dont want to repeat which makes it even more frustrating

so what am i to say just dont play this game at all

#####

game is still in early access

note i have never played train valley 1 so i cannot compare both games

train valley 2 is a simulationpuzzle game where you have to built railroads between different stations and transport different goods bricks sand logs  grain etc and workers between the stations
you have to avoid collisions between the trains because that will cost you a lot of money
as you progress the levels get more difficult because you have to buy for example tunnels and bridges
all those building costs money and you got a limit amount at the beginning so you got plan carefully which stations you are going to link first so you van earn more money
you can also upgrade your trains
if you succeeded a level you get stars 5 max some of the stars you get for finishing a level in a specific time i dont like timed games but even if you are not that fast like me you still can finish a level but ofc not with 5 stars
so you have to act and think quick

its not really my kind of game but that doesnt mean its a bad game at all
do you like trains puzzles and dont you mind timers or grindy gameplay then this game could be for you the asking price is ok
i would give this game a 65 out of 10 but that could change because the game is still in early access
i didnt encouter any bugs

achievements will be added later according to the dev

i got this game for free but it didnt influence my review

great little puzzle game worthy of a punt

dont get it looking for a railroad tycoon type of game this is a puzzle game with trains

#####

hard to recommend it starts off fun but eventually becomes more about battling the terrain than anything as others have mentioned this happens around lvl25 so you can get about 1215hrs of a more relaxed game in before it becomes tedious

another issue i have is building a bridge sometimes destroys the track underneath it so you have to go back and build the track ive had that issue wreck two 5star runs and these 5star runs take 3045mins if its your first time on the track trying to figure out the terrain not destroy tiles and how the level designer wants you to get to some oddly placed factory with 4 different items if there was some warning mssg than that would greatly help bc you can see that some of your track has been destroyed until you squint or your train blows up

track direction changing on its own is also an annoying issue i wish the tracks were locked to my direction and they wouldnt change if a train drives over it going the opposite direction

ill probably keep playing it from time to time but im going to look elsewhere to find a game more focused on logistics and trains rather than a challenge against placing tiles on oddly designed terrain

#####

no huge dissappointment ive played 12 scenarios with only one accidental crash i do not even closely get the same enjoyment or sense of achievement that i got from tv1 like the german expansion of tv1  crashing trains and driving into the wrong station to win the game is just silly the music is mediocre and repetative compared to tv1 playing against time in every scenario is frustrating there are very obvious choices where to lay trackbridgestunnels that planning aspect is gone  whereas it was a great part of tv1 its actually more a like a puzzle game than a train game the trains are incedental to the purpose of the game if you liked tv1  do not expect something similar it is a different game

#####

different core game play mechanic than the first train valley its way easier and not as much of a real time strategy train management compared to before in this sequel you can send out trains at your own time to move materials from one station to another and the only challenges are the ones that require some track restriction planning no more worrying about trains crashing into each other unless on the very rare accident or achievement hunting apparently the dlc has levels that are more similar to train valley 1 but i have yet to play it i would still recommend it for casual train track building with a few dozen levels

#####

a nice game but a completely different genre than train valley 1 


uinstead of train stations there are factoriespower plantsu
the entire concept of the game was changed basically this is not a game about managing your trains and their tracks anymore instead its a game about managing resources electricity and transferring produced goods to cities i guess it depends on each players preference but i personally dont like the new concept as soon as the power plants were introduced i left the game 


uthere is no time pressure anymoreu
meaning trains dont leave the train station against your will anymore if you take too long to attend them instead trains will wait somewhere in the abyss not even in the train stations you sent them to last until you need them
this removes most of the challenge and fun that train valley 2 offered


 there is only an optional goal to beat the level under a specific time stamp but zero punishment if you fail


uthe new mapu
the new map has a lot of disadvantages
 its buggy
 its not in the bird perpective anymore which negatively affects the overview the player has as well as their ability to build tracks on rough terrain
 it forces the player to put down tracks bridges and tunnels the way the level designers intended
that being said each level has a beautiful looking map and the new art style is  while it depends on personal preference  nice


for me personally the game is barely playable sadly while i think the reinvention of train valley was nicely executed i wonder if anyone really asked for this

ia plus point though for the historical timeline  according maps reaching from the steam engine era to the computer age á la civilizationi

#####

must 5 start everything
i cant tell if its a sickness or not but i have to replay over and over until its achieved

#####

best train game that is free on epic this week

#####

this could have been a good relaxing game but due to the fact that there is no save option or undo button for the last action or anything like that it is very frustrating because one wrong click can ruin a whole level

#####

i wasnt sure that train valley 2 could improve on the original train valley   im pleased to say that i was wrong   train valley 2 is fantastic exciting and much deeper than its predecessor   being in full control of which trains go where and when is the first improvement in this game   but i think the best aspect of it is the new multistage production chain   it provides a new level of strategy and deeper planning than just responding to the ping of some color    add in new features like bridges and tunnels the game challenges you to think in new ways sometimes forcing you into riskier choices to achieve the 5star award at the end   

as a development build im extremely impressed  it is very stable with only a few strange graphical glitches that ive noticed when running in superfast speed     im looking forward to the editor perhaps breathing continued life into this great game for years to come by allowing the creative people in the community to contribute to a large library of custom maps 

well done  5star rating from me

#####

the game is great and an overall improvement on the rather basic tv1 i  see some people resent that but i also cannot see what else cold be done with the first games simple mechanics

why the negative review then because since update#2 the game is crashing on launch on mac
until this is fixed i cannot play the game or check the updates on a product which i bought on day 1 
i will change this review when the issue will be fixed

edit
the dev has been superfriendly and looked into the issue which is related to the connection between the steam client  unity  my version of osx
they have sent me temporary build with limited functionality but that doesnt crash while they find a more permanent solution 
and that by itself is enough for me to change my review into a positive one

go dev

#####

train valley was a light and delightful puzzle game that was just subtly flavored like a tycoon game 

train valley 2 is thematically more of a tycoon game there are production chains money actually matters this time but somehow even more puzzley than before 

unfortunately this game has had a bizarre experience curve it took a couple of scenarios to really warm up to then they became a lot of fun unfortunately as they grew in complexity the later missions became criminally unfun about halfway through the game the maps become incredibly contrived and each puzzle only has one solution  usually something really arcane and fiddly about getting the order and timing exactly right and some of the scenarios are very long and involved  a single mistake can force you to throw away an otherwise perfect mission and start over 

in short it starts out boring and ends miserably but for a bit in the middle its a whole lot of fun

#####

train valley 2 is a massive improvement over its predecessor the first part was a lovely puzzle game which excelled because it kept things very simply you lay train tracks between stations and make sure trains end up at their correct station this sequel adds a lot of complexity while maintaining the charm of the original you now have to lay tracks to production facilities such as farms and coal mines and then connect these to other factories like animal farms to make products for your cities once youve produced enough youve completed the level

this requires a lot more planning particularly in the later levels where you also need to build bridges and tunnels the game gets even more complex when some factories require power which means you have to provide power stations with fuel and people at the right time levels also get more dynamic with for example canals being build while youre playing making certain parts of the level inaccessible later on

while building tracks you also have to consider investing in more or faster trains with more capacity this will become necessary later on but timing your purchases is important if you dont want to run out of money

the goal is still to complete missions as quickly as possible for stars with some bonus objectives to add to the challenge going back to get all 5 stars will definitely keep you playing for many hours train valley 2 is every bit as fun as the first part and is one of the best sequels ive seen in a long time

#####

httpsyoutubemwwpmthbde8
the best way i can categorize this game is as a puzzle train management game the game is much different then train valley 1 but i enjoyed it more than the original to sum it up you have to build your railroads so that you can deliver people to make goods then send those good to either your main cities or to another train station to build something different the game continues to add different mechanics to the game as you go higher in level you can either play the game just to beat it or try and 5 star the level which means you complete it quickly and completing the 2 objectives that they give you per level if you like to fully complete everything 5 star this game will cause you soooooo much trouble haha

i have attached some game play above just so you can see if you would like it 

overall an awesome game which will kills soooooooo much of your time 


#####

its kinda fun but also too frustrating   let us take back moves since it often isnt clear on what you can do until you try it  or least set checkpoints  starting over from the beginning is brutal and unnecessary and caused me to give up in frustration  i built all that track to get that point where for some reason there is something invisible wrong with that block of terrain so it wont let me build on it  and that is the only way through anywhere nearby  come on

#####

the mechanics from tv1 remain faithfully intact and familiar to fans of train valley but its refreshing to see that this isnt just extra levels for tv1 the way that resources need to be delivered in certain quanitites to certain stations is novel and forces the player to strategise in order to make their system efficient especially if youre trying to beat the time challenges

a satisfying puzzler despite at this point march 2018 being unfinished

#####

uin shortu this is a lovely genre mix between trainrouting puzzle and light economic simulation while it can have stressful moments being built around an active pause feature makes this is a casual and very enjoyable experience the game ships with 30 hours of content while excellent workshop support provides a near endless amount of fresh levels i love the art style and the music this is very different from train valley 1 and i vastly prefer the new approach a very easy recommendation from me even at full price

uin longu the bugameplayub is quite different and much deeper than in train valley 1 tv1 where tv1 was primarily a trainrouting game tv2 adds a rich layer of simplified economic simulation on top cities produce workers and demand certain goods to finish the level by shipping workers and goods between various industries your goal is to satisfy their needs as efficiently as possible where tv1 was about reacting to random train spawns and juggling as many trains as you could handle tv2 is about prioritizing the right fares with your limited amount of trains and spending your money wisely i like tv1 as a casual diversion but i definitely prefer tv2 making a highlevel plan and setting priorities is a lot more rewarding when it ends up working out than just reacting to train spawns
there is an absolute buboatload of contentub the game comes with 50 levels ranging from short and simple to hourlong and highly complex each level comes with 3 challenges based on the ingame timer thankfully excluding pauses and 2 additional challenges that often put a really interesting spin on otherwise mediocre levels examples do not build more than 1 tunnel do not reverse trains etc not every level is gold but on average the quality is very high most levels are elegantly designed and some feature interesting unique gimmicks like changing water levels the few stages that fall short can be fairly annoying though especially when they have punishing challenges where a minor oversight towards the end of the level forces you to replay the whole thing as a slow and methodical player i took my time with each level and ended up spending roughly 40 hours on getting 5 stars on every campaign level barely having to replay any levels can get a little bit too long for my taste towards the end but tv2 never felt like overstaying its welcome or getting stale

the budeveloper supportub is nothing short of breathtaking i have never seen anything like it tv2 comes with a pretty good level editor that certainly has some annoying quirks but is a very powerful tool that remains decently approachable this has lead to a workshop with over 1300 submissions each week the developer curates and features the best new levels awarding the weekly winner a 10 euro steam giftcard ifair disclaimer one of my levels has won such a prize without me trying for it so technically ive been paid by the developer most of this review has been written in advance and i have entered no obligation to be positive about the gamei there have been several postrelease patches adding new assets to the editor even some unique production buildings that do not feature in the base game the ingame leaderboards ended up being fairly useless your results will only be assigned to rough percentiles and there is some kind of intransparent cutoff that removes the top howevermany percent to exclude cheaters which leaves you with no way to compete or even to know what very good times are the developers instead host weekly challenges but ive never participated as they require thirdparty software to submit your results still a nice touch by the devs to keep the community active

tv2 is one of those rare games that manages to marry rocksolid coregameplay with amazing bupresentationub the ui is slick and smart and the menus ooze style i really dig the clean lowpolygon art style all the levels are beautiful unique and memorable most with a distinct mood and references to realworld places only once i starting working with the editor did i realize just how many unique assets this game has its mindblowing
one of the biggest surprises to me was the quality of the soundtrack on 99 of games i play i end up turning the music off in the first 5 hours because i just cant stand it anymore tv2 was an exception even after dozens of hours it was never really grating and i sometimes found myself humming along to the incredibly catchy tunes i give this game a rare recommendation to buy the sondtrack the sound effects are decent with a few nasty outliers particularly electricity generation making an awful creaking noise

on the butechnical sideub i have absolutely no complaints with separate volume sliders and a windowed mode with adjustable borders the basics are covered on top you get a slider for graphical quality with optional antialiasing on the lowest settings i had no problems playing on an old integrated graphics card well below the store page specifications as one would expect from a lowpoly unity game a separate interface scaler and completely rebindable hotkeys are the icing on the cake good stuff
 
in buconclusionub this is a brilliant genre mix that was clearly made with a lot of love and attention to detail the active pause allows you to carefully plan and conduct an insane symphony of trains that feels very rewarding i was skeptical about tv2 being fairly different after enjoying tv1 but this is a really neat and satisfying game that looks and sounds great and has amazing developer support on top tv2 is easily worth buying at full price

h1so many levelsh1
i got this on release since i had a great time with the original the sequel certainly delivered
 extended core gameplay made a little more puzzly
 great aesthetic like the original
 very nice soundtrack
 tons of levels not to mention the workshop ones
 progression system with new train models
 i found it hard to go through the whole 50 levels to finish the game though new complexity is introduced as you progress the core mechanics remain the same and it can get repetitive after 10hrs however i will surely return fresh someday to finish it

#####

just finished all 50 levels after 37 hours the game is very good although there are some occasional annoyances such as losing a star because you placed a bridge and it destroyed a track tile without the player realising that was going to happen or building a bridgetunnel realising its never going to work in that position but even deleting it immediately only gives you half the money back its satisfying to solve each levels puzzle and there are occasionally nailbiter level endings where the last goods are delivered with only a second to go

#####

the fun fades away after lvl 25 it gets more complicated than interesting

#####

as others have said this is less train management simulator and more puzzle game which is unfortunately not what im personally after 

1 no object permanence of trains trains only exist when on rails you have a limited number of trains which does not mean that you have to return it to your station to move workers it just means that when that train enters another building you can then resend it from your station with that the game starts to feel more tedious less like a challenge of designing a network and more just oneway pointatopointb

2 workers are a resource that is constantly required and is also consumed you need resources like sand to make resources like glass yeah makes sense but you also need workers who only come from a station so you send workers to go harvest sand and now whoops theyre gone now you send the sand to the glass making place and you need an extra trip to send workers there they just feel tedious

aside from that the game is fine its pretty cute the geometric style is a little bit distracting because the attention to detail put into the landscape almost draws too much attention

#####

ive won this game through steamgifts website
train valley 2 is a much different game then its predecessor it has become almost only logical game with trains theme and optional arcade action well its not a bad thing in overall but some people may not enjoy that it is far more optimized and polished but after longer  time game becomes boring for short runs it has its charm however game itself is quite long and with steam workshop one can play almost endlessly multiplatform support is a nice touch too no problems under linux

#####

i really wanted to like this game but its just not that fun to play the thing that made the first game fun was managing random and irregular demand on your track network in this one everything is awfully predictable and linear this makes going through a level just executing the obvious steps to build up to your objective

and the game had potential for some more depth with the crafting system but its not restrictive at all you can overproduce and it is even necessary in some levels to have enough money also having unbalanced production is pretty much a nonissue it feels like factorio with no automation and no interesting production lines

the one thing that this game does much better than the first one is the ui and track placement its way less awkward to lay and merge tracks elevation and bridges also make the maps more unique i really wish i could play the first game with these features

its not a bad game but it was disappointing to me still onboard to see what these devs do next

#####

the time limit is far too harsh to make this the relaxing game it should be

#####

i only recommend this game to people if they liked the randomness of the first game and do not think that they will find the gameplay repetitive given that the locations of resources and delivery locations are fixed  because that is more a matter of preference i will err on the side of recommending the game
here is what else you need to know
the game is all about delivering resources or commodities to factories or towns respectively which means
the routes for sending trains are more fixed than the first game
gameplay is much more about which order and when to send trains than it determining track paths to new locations
as someone who enjoyed the first one game i found it repetitive after 20 out of the 50 levels but others may not so i still recommend it to others the passenger flow may provide gameplay that is more like the first game
bridges or tunnels are new to this sequel
some factories must be purchased before they are unlocked in order for them to receive or produce commodities
look feel and function of the game is as polished as the first

#####

the game is not so easy at the very beginning its more puzzle than cosy d i wished they put more details in the tutorial maybe

after you grab the basic concepts its lot of fun and hours of game really immersive but at the same time 1 game dont take you too long so its perfect if you dont have lots of time to give to games  

finally i love the graphics and colors and level of details

#####

 its completely different from the first game the first game was about managing train traffic and planning out the best routes for trains this game is about managing resources and theres often only one good place to put tracks on the uneven terrain its generally quite obvious how to solve levels and then doing so is just a chore

 you have to get all 5 stars at once you cant go back and clean up single missed stars this is super annoying

 you basically have to play in realtime because at any of the faster speeds you lose enough time to not be able to 5star levels so you can spend 10 minutes on a level screw up a little and then  have to do it all over again as slow as can be

 the user interface is worse i often will try to switch a track but accidentally stop a train in front of it instead one time like 7 minutes into a level i tried to click something accidentally built a bridge and then didnt have enough money left to complete the level just had to start it over

 i liked the art style of the old game better with this one its sometimes hard to tell where you are allowed to place tracks

#####

opened and found an awesomely clean interface but unimpressed by the number of levels

was so wrong is there instead where i think excels and shines devs work

puzzles are so well blended in the simulation to give best of both

got it gifted but id pay the full honest price eyes closed

#####

i have over 150 hours on train valley  its very dear to me and i totally enjoy playing it
the best thing about train valley 2 is it has made me realize how much i appreciate train valley and i have gone back reset my progress and i am playing it again because i prefer to play something i enjoy  tv2 is not that game
i would rather pay the full price of tv2 for dlc for tv1  at least i would have enjoyed it and got value for money
tv2 has taken the best parts of train valley and trashed it  the graphics shrinkage the micromanagement its just not train valley any more  people may find the change in graphics and direction a good idea but for me its a step in the wrong direction  its not the same game any more

#####

openttd without all that complicated economic sandbox malarkey just find the most optimal way to produce and deliver the goods in the allotted time
its pretty much crack with trains and star ratings

#####

an excellent successor to train valley 1

instead of trains spawning at random stations with random destinations youre tasked with having to move product from one station or factory to another in order to create goods

a little more strategy and a little more micromanagement

eta now out of ea the complete game has so many more mechanics electricity and customs for example

and if you happen to prefer the style of play from tv1 the expansion adds that option into the game too

with the workshop theres literally hundreds of player made maps and still literally hundreds of quality maps

theres also a weekly contest that is slowly creating a community amongst players the developers are active as well

#####

horrible experience with the tutorial with the tutorial
al those popups appear before you have any chance to do something or the interrupt you in the middle of the action
the tutorial is really badly designed it destroyed my entire experience
uninstaled

#####

this puzzle game manages to capture the essence of what makes train games interesting

youre moving freight from sources to destinations most destinations convert goods from one material to another ie converting sand  labor to glass so youre creating production chains you design your track layout to best serve your needs which can be quite a struggle when the terrain is rough and the way not obvious youre running a lot of trains along common rails so figuring out the most efficient schedule is part of the challenge

the flaws are relatively few the game really cries out for a midpuzzle save feature or at least and undo feature its pretty frustrating to get 30 minutes into a puzzle and realize an early tracklaying decision hosed you or to abruptly lose because you werent watching everywhere at once and two trains collided

there are some tools available to fix mistakes like halting trains or deleting track but some levels prohibit these things its understandable in some puzzles because deleting the prebuilt track would eliminate the main challenge of the level

regardless its still well worth playing its not railway empire by any means but its good

#####

this is not a train strategy game because the trains magically disappear once reaching their destinations and then can take a timespace portal to magically reappear at any other station to start a new route i would call this more of a casual puzzle game like bejeweled

#####

bthis feels like a step backward from the original itrain valleyib yes i know this is early access  but my main issues are just with fundamental design decisions this isnt about rough edges or level of polish now im not going to refund or anything but i just find this game tedious and confusing in ways that it totally doesnt have to be they should have focused more on train management and less on fiddly numbers for train managementpuzzle enthusiasts id just go with imashinkyi at this point

iessentially you build train lines to various  locations to meet goals and earn moneyi from what i see there is currently enough content to merit the asking price so one goal may be to get refined wood boards okay so you need to push trains to the forest to get the raw wood and then to the refinery to make boards the odd thing is that you also need to pump trains into the refinery to actually act as workers i have a hard time wrapping my head around why it was designed like this but okay i also dont like how more than one worker can be on a train for whatever reason i just find this design model overly confusing and i think its because it is illogical bat the end of the day i just dont find it funb

bprosb
there is a good amount of content and polish already

bconsb
i find the whole worker management part fiddly and tedious
i hate time goals and this is the majority of the goals for each level its weak sauce and uncreative
i dont feel like the rules follow much logic which would have been so simple to do
the artwork and whole production feels like it was designed for mobile
strikei wish you could just play with the mouse but you really need the keyboard to pause quicklystrike

beh id just as soon pass on this oneb if you 100d the first one then you will probably have a good time with this one

#####

trains man

#####

h1fun until it goes off the railsh1
i reeeaaally want to like and recommend this game it scratches the itch of managing resources and coming up with efficient layouts and you get to look at little trains while you say toot toot whats not to love  so i came very close to loving this fairly frequently but it always inevitably falls apart as if  ironically enough  on a schedule

there has never been a day that ive launched the game played it for a while and ibnotbi altf4d out in frustration either because the indicators for what is being selected can be unclear for example one unruly piece of track as opposed to the massive bridge necessary to complete a level or the lack of an ability to plot out a track construction in pause without having to hold the mouse down iespeciallyi when the routing can feel like its making its own path at times or the lack of clear audiovisual cues for when a bridge support deletes a preexisting section of track clear cues iotheri than a train exploding on what was once a perfectly clear stretch of track that is or level goals so poorly explained or so slowly doled out in popups that they might as well be trial and error or the fact that someone made the arbitrary choice to limit junctions to 2 directions throwing off otherwise solid planning and without any realworld analogue to justify it its just a choice the devs made that you now have to remember rather than a natural consequence of the mechanics themselves etc

there is a glacial upgrade path where earning stars allows existing trains to become pretty much imperceptibly faster so you can replay older levels to get more stars to unlock further upgrades but 1 that loop slows to an agonizing crawl very quickly and 2 to get all 5 stars on a level you have to clear all of them uin a single runu you cant just replay a level in a different way to brute force remaining stars and move on and yes learning this too is trial and error much like the 2way junctions the devs will iforcei you to play a certain way but without the justification of directing you toward different playstyles the number of jankass issues with this game is large enough that you can progress several levels only to have an old issue come back to haunt you because you were juggling so many others thats how ive managed to put so much time into this game before dropping a review like this its ialmosti fine until a minute away from ifinallyi clearing 5 stars on a level a train will explode offscreen because of something the game didnt bother to tell you and the last 15 minutes youve spent minmaxing building and routing are now a complete waste of time the devs are still working on this so i hope they take note

bwithout the possibility of incremental progress a failstate that can completely negate over 20 minutes of work sucks even more so when that time was being spent on an already miniscule rewardb

a good example is the level maeklong where you can learn that a rail line can pass straight through a station which is convenient for the early game but then you cannot stop a train at that station so no objectives there can be completed so you delete the bridge you built making the station the end of a line again right nope first one train has to explode there itheni and buonlyub then will other trains stop there once youve already made 25 objectives impossible what rule did i learn there not to trust this game to make sense it left such a sour taste that when i 5starred the following level on the first try i didnt feel a sense of accomplishment i just felt a sense of relief that there was one less level id have to redo biuthats not a feeling you want players to have when nailing objectivesuib

and so thats where im at the objective that feels like making the most progress is finally hitting uninstall better luck with #3 i guess

#####

one of my favorite games it looks simple at first but its very complex and a delicious puzzle besides there is a thriving community creating new maps about every day so the game never ends there are simple and fast maps and other fairy complex and long for all tastes
after 1629 hours playing i finally finished all main games maps with 5 stars just did the fearful frankfurt this minute   now i have to finish 1 map on the dlc new york to have them all with 5 stars 
but what i do these days every day is to play the workshop maps 
one of these days i will start making maps too

#####

form lovers of puzzles train valley was a wonderful challenge train valley 2 takes it next level gone are the heavy waits for trains to appear replaced by patience for resources the variety of levels and individual challenges make this an amazing little puzzler i cant wait to pick up the passenger flow dlc and see whats next

#####

i loved the first train valley game so i was really looking forward to this one but as it turns out train valley 2 is not like its predecessor at all yes theyre both about managing trains and building train tracks with different tasks you have to perform but thats pretty much where the similarities ends i agree with some of the other people who didnt recommend this game either its not enjoyable in the same way as the first as it lacks the puzzle and strategy part and something i really liked about tv1 was the music and the mix between playing something relaxing and oddly enough stressful at the same time and here its just stressful because you feel like youre just playing against time and that is a big no for me always has been
but seeing as this is an early access game i do hope it will get better eventually

#####

great logisticslite active puzzle game  the devs have recently patched some annoyances with controls and challenges and now i can give it a glowing review with no hesitation

#####

this is the type of game that will make you rage quit after crashing a train only to immediately start the game up again

#####

this is an awesome relaxing puzzle game
id say its better than original train valley

#####

tv2 has just launched on early access and ive finished my first play through of tv2 as it stands 20 levels i really like the new mechanics and systems of tv2 from tv1 its a fresh game with that feeling of similarity 

it took me a little over 5 hours to complete the 20 levels supposedly there will be 50 levels total each map has different accomplishments that you need to meet you can get a total of 5 stars for each map with 3 stars for finishing quickly and another 2 stars based on a variety of challenges eg dont stop a train no trains to the wrong station crash 5 trains etc ive gotten 4 stars on most maps with a few 5 stars i havent replayed any levels 

as usual with any ea game there are some tweaks that need to happen however its fully playable and i didnt experience any major bugs or issues

ive made some suggestions to the devs and they very quickly responded gotta love when devs are active and listening to the community

verdict i like it and think 10 is a reasonable price for the game



#####

i bought this on a whim becasue i liked tv1 and ive gotta say its my current favorite while its a depature from the first and has more management mechaninzims its totally accessable and very fun the objectives are completely clear so you can plan your strategy instead of react to whats popping up

getting 5 stars is a decent challenge yet the game is totally playable by younger kids 

cant wait for more content and especially the editor

#####

its a pretty great train game i was skeptical about the change to a more realistic economic model compared to the first game but it really works even in the puzzlish setting

the scenarios are a bit long for lacking a mid mission save though  if youre shooting for 5 stars its too easy to fail an objective and have to do the whole thing over

still strongly recommended

#####

so i have spent about 3 hours with the alpha version now reached level 9 and it is good different from train valley 1 a bit slower more puzzely and strategical but good 

the main difference is that the trains are no longer random but you control where and when they are going it is now not so much a matter of juggling the arriving trains but choosing what to prioritise and the order you transport goods and workers to produce different products 

this makes it a bit different each map have 1 or more cities and some factories each city has a goal for example deliver 10 cows to produce a cow you need first to have a farm to make grain then transport the grain to a ranch then transport the cow to the city each production site  factory requires workers 1 worker for each produced unit who live in the cities  

so the work flow for the cows are  transport workers to the farm transport workers to the ranch transport grain from the farm to the ranch transport cows to the city you have a limed number of trains say four trains in this scenario and each holds 2 units 2 workers 2 grain 2 cows it is possible to buy more trains or upgrade the existing trains to take 3 units but this is expensive if a train crashes it needs to be repaired before you  can use it again  

as you go along the maps have more than one city each requiring different products and then off course you need to plan and build the tracks to be most efficient  you have again different tasks to achieve stars on each level there are no five stars for each  three of them are linked to how fast you complete the level and the other two are specific goals ie no crashes build x amount of tracks destroy buildings for x amount of monies  

overall this makes the game more proactive and strategical and less reactive and crisis management than train valley 1

#####

i love building and i love puzzling and the challenge of multitasking 
thanks to the many workshop levels i played it almost each day since i purchased it in 2018 and it has become one of the very few alltimefavourites of mine

not only because of the fun gameplay but because of the neat community existing and devs who care about their game
there are hundrets of playermade workshop levels there are weekly challenges organized by the devs and levelcreation contests on a regular basis


#####

better than the first imo very fun simple puzzlesim game

#####

if you cant tell from the hours played on this game i recommend it  i enjoyed the original train valley game and was quite skeptical with the 2nd one with how different it was  but the gameplay with resource and time management is very fun even more fun than the first one  now i wouldnt have this many hours playtime if it wasnt for their workshop which allows you to make and play your own levels along with other peoples levels  its really fun and interesting to see some of the wacky and sometimes very challenging levels that they create  even though the full game isnt out yet still worth checking out

#####

train valley 1 was a fun game train valley 2 is the same but better and more graphics style is gorgeous very stylish lowpoly suits this game so well music and sfx do their job to keep you in a good mood and the gameplay itself is satisfying if you like these kind of games of course

#####

this was included in a humble choice as an extra freebie and i wasnt expecting much from it however this is a really fun puzzle game and ive spent far much longer playing it than i thought i would each level is selfcontained so they dont feel too overwhelming you really have to think outside the box to get the 5 stars for some of the levels found that the level difficulty progression was just about right  i started to drop stars around level 20 but the levels themselves are still doable with some thought

#####

a quite good followup to the original train valley new mechanics make it better than just more of the same and a level editor   will vastly expand the lifetime of the game i highly recommend it

#####

train valley is a fantastic addictive little puzzle game like all good puzzles the base mechanics are simple to understand  deliver workers and goods to stations produce the target materials bring these materials to specific cities the joy comes from the complexity born of the maps funds time limits and additional challenge requirements completing every level in the game is easy but doing them all with 5 star ratings will require you to develop a keen understanding of the game

the best selling point by far however is the community the game has a workshop mode where players can make their own levels and the developers host weekly competitions on discord where hundreds of people try to set the best possible time on a community map these challenges are a great way to truly master the games mechanics as the champions are always happy to share tips and video solutions

the dlcs both add new levels mechanics and cosmetic options to the game increasing the challenge and giving more options for community content i can heartily recommend them both

#####

if all games would be like this i would never get any work done its great and offers a ton of bang for the buck

#####

updated review with the passenger flow dlc

for all those people who dont like the new game play and want something more like tv1
the passenger flow dlc is what you are looking for it adds 20 new scenarios with the game play from tv1 into the game although some scenarios are a mixture of tv1 and tv2 game play so hopefully this will give you what you desire

httpsyoutube2fxo37uhs40

i loved train valley and hoped that train valley 2 could achieve the same level of fun and enjoyment of the original
so far it looks like it has done that

it looks great the gameplay now requires you to move not just trains to the right station but to get workers and resources to the right stations too

so far i love it
here is the first scenario
httpsyoutubesgxsv0my3fg

#####

train valley 2 is the perfect sequel it brings back the engaging and addicting gameplay of the first game but gives it a completely fresh twist and builds upon it in so many different and intriguing ways

the main twist is an overhaul in the central gameplay loop whereas in the first game the goal was quite 1 dimensional get train from station a to station b in train valley 2 production lines have been introduced adding a whole new dimension and layer of depth to the game the first level sets this up in its most rudimental form transport workers from the city to the lumber mill to produce lumber transport workers and the newly produced lumber to the sawmill to produce planks finally deliver a certain amount of lumber and planks back to the city

from then on the production lines become ever more complicated and the levels require ever more ingenuity to solve the puzzle of getting all the right trains and goods to the right places at the right times to maximise the efficiency of your train and production network efficiency is important as new time goals have been added so no slacking off

with the option to upgrade speed and capacity and add more locomotives to help you complete the level even more strategising is required to know exactly when to upgrade your trains especially whilst your money may be better spent on other things eg constructing the next factory in your production chain

similarly to the first game certain levels also include unique set pieces which add a further wrinkle to the puzzle wont give anything away as these levels are a joy to discover and have your brain boggled by

with more than double the levels of the original game there is a lot of content which will keep you entertained for a good long while especially with the added challenge of getting 5 stars in each level

thoroughly enjoyed and recommended

#####

micro management with trains you basically harvest resources and move workers from one location to another to get a desired product all while racing to get a good time and those bonus stars

here is my first look video if anyone wants to see me fail and blow trains up

different playstyle from tv1 but still a good fun game and definitely not addictive definitely spoilerwell just forgot to eat and sleep lol spoiler
must buy

强推
和前作风格完全不同但是仍然很有意思嗯我绝对没有上瘾
买就对了

je ladore
différent que le premier mais toujours un très bon jeu amusant strike et pas plus addictif 	strike
recommandé même en accès anticipé

empfohlen
unterhält sehr gut und das funktioniert hervorragend obwohl in early access war

#####

several people have described this game as a series of puzzles and that is a pretty accurate description except it leaves out that all them are solving track layout and train scheduling problems that take around half an hour to play im really enjoying it the one thing i wish is that you could save the game in the middle

#####

take everything fun about the first game then remove it or change it for the worse then you have this sequel which does not come anywhere close to the magic of the first game 

if a game is more tedious than fun youve done something wrong with the design ill never understand why devs make drastic changes to sequels or why they think removing the key enjoyable design choices will make the sequel better 

this game is literally lets give them mostly annoying objectives and then give them way too short a time to have fun achieving them

i bought this game because i really enjoyed train valley train valley 2 isnt a sequel its a completely different game that shares a few basic elements you have trains you build tracks but thats it the first game was fun this game is so not fun its tedious and a slap in the face to fans of the original

just go play the first game and forget this one exists

#####

the most addictive game i have ever played

#####

after playing train valley 1 i really wanted to try this out  too bad its nothing like the original  its bland and boring  the first one gave excitement and challenge that i loved  this one feels like a chore  can trains have personality  this game has none  its just bland  wish it was the first one with just minor updates and mechanics or something  this remake didnt hit the mark for me

#####

i may change my review at a later date but this game is not like train valley 1 and i had been looking forward to another game like that  the first game is more a puzzlestrategy game whereas this one is just time management  i dont find it fun to play like i did train valley 1  im still playing the game but im very disappointed in it at the moment

#####

i bought this game ever since it came out of early access i was surprised to see that it was quite different from tv1 but i liked the concept however after level 20 the levels get more challenging and you really need to think and consider your options like a true puzzle game sometimes it is frustrating but then the feeling of accomplishment is much greater i play this game when i am in the mood for a puzzle game if not i usually choose a more relaxing game as it is very stressful to have several trains move and have their timing correctly set up so they wont crash into each other still i do recommend it to people who like a good puzzle game

after 50 hours still not done with this game not sure if that says something about my puzzle skills but still having a lot of fun i love the passengers dlc

#####

great little train game
its more of a puzzle game than a full sim
it looks fab and its fun to play

#####

great game really enjoyed playing through all the levels i feel towards the end levels the game should get harder rather than just longer and not be a chore finding out where you can build tracks

#####

edit
385 hours
after eventually making to level 45 of casual play i have to say the difficulty curve just got to a point where this is the most unfun resource micromanage puzzle to play the resource curve needs tuning in several places funds feel too tight to even get tier 1 resources made and funds are far too plentiful near the end as tiered production ramps up and the delivery of tier 3 goods makes money worries vanish the difficulty curve is inversed super tuned no reasonable margin of error reset level early on if you slip up because theres no room for recovery and then super easy after 25 minutes into the later levels

accidentally laid too many tracks 5 minutes in and not enough funds left to connect a route you need hard reset your first 15 minutes in the later levels are spent less on moving trains and way more on trying to figure out the most optimal route first thus usually results in many level resets until you know the optimal delivery order thats how the levels were designed giving the player that only route option until the money really starts coming in this difficulty gets compounded if theres a station on a regular departure schedule early on that you cant control your first priority is to get that route connected asap or the game punishes you by bringing your funds into the negative any slip up on that early on is also a hard reset

and thats just to complete the level with the bare minimum i understand this difficulty curve if you were going for best time or a high score but the finely tuned level design has turned the completion of the 40s into a right of passage i feel like i deserve an accolade figuring out the later levels on the first try without going bankrupt or looking up what other have done 


55 hours 
too puzzley for what i was expecting its fun and cathartic early on just like the first game but later levels get super challenging if you dont understand the track layout the levels design is expecting youll be hitting that reset button every time you find yourself needing to redo the whole track i called it quits when i got to the level that randomly destroys your tracks for no reason other than to provide more of an artificial challenge there are several uxui improvements that can be made to make the current gameplay less frustrating 

i like the gameplay for what it is i equate it to settlers of catan with train thats why i always come back to it i always walk away frustrated because its a tiered puzzle game i dont want to solve when i ask myself is this bad level design or is it only allowing a specific rail layout i dont like the fact that several pathways come down to only one option in levels where theres a gimmick

#####

even in early acces a very enjoyable little game reminds me of some old browser games great animations and graphics my only complaint is that it feels somewhat short average replayability well worth it at this price if you have nothing to do for 23 evenings

#####

more puzzle game than a management simulation but still very enjoyable definitely not casual after a 10 or so levels

#####

this basically functions as a puzzle game as you seek to map out train tracks to help transport resources to produce whatever you need to clear the level

pros
solid concept and set up everything makes sense and its an engaging brain teaser mapping out what you need to do and in what sequence can be pretty fun and engaging
lots of extra challenges to push you to try and clear levels in specific ways with different restrictions fun way of pushing the player to be more creative without forcing players to do it if they dont want to

cons
sometimes you have the level solved pretty fast but you still have to sit there for an extended time just doing the busywork of hitting the switches so that trains go the right way this part of the game can be kind of tedious
overall tedium is the biggest turn off theres so many times where i just have to sit there and wait for trains to pass so that i can send more where they need to go i get that this happens to create more challenges in how you approach the levels but it often feels more restricting and tedious than challenging

overall i enjoyed the game for a decent while but some of the levels just got to tedious for me to see it all the way through if you enjoy minmaxing and puzzles this game is a decent pickup i wanted to enjoy the game more but i just think that some of its core mechanics limited me from enjoying the game as much as i usually would

rating 610


#####

good gameplay but faulty configuration and needs a lot of features like saving midgame  or maybe undo i like the game overall but is really stressing when you have to do a level all over again because of an accidental move and i mean accidental in terms of clicking by hovering over the laptop mouse pad not because you didnt mean to or something like that all that said is taking in consideration the fact that a level can las for 30 miuntes to many hours

#####

i just finished the game with five stars on all 20 scenarios the game is a lot of fun i like the time pressure aspect of the game theres more planning in terms of how you will deliver goods and get things timed correctly to deliver to factories i do wish the game had more than one optimal way to solve each level theres really only one or two track layouts for each level that let you solve the game on time

#####

granted i only give this game a no due to my own personal interest not because its a bad game 

ill just say this if you played train valley 1 and are excited to see and play the sequel im sorry to say this isnt the sequel youll be expecting and this is unfortunately where i fall into the game is completely different from the first except that there are trains and you build tracks and this combined with the challenges revolving around resources instead of managing the trains themselves making the game feel a lot slower is why im jumping off the tracks

however that isnt to say this is a bad game just not my cup of tea especially after falling in love with the first gameif youre new or played the first and are still curious maybe give it a shot its cheap and you may like the changes and there are some cool sounding stuff and cool features such as  a leader board comparing various stats of how well you did to others around the world unlockable cosmetic looks for your trains through earning stars from levels theres also a level builder and youre able to try other player built levels however i jumped out before testing this so the quality of this feature could be great or terrible i unfortunately cant say but it sounds great

tldr as a returning player the new game is completely different and removed what i personally loved from the first game and replaced it with mechanics and game play i really dont like so im dropping it and just leaving disappointed however that is just me and not to say this is a bad game some may enjoy it just i dont

#####

i really really wanted to love this game for a while i enjoyed it quite a bit ultimately the controls of the game became the true enemy here and when those became a more significant problem than any of the logic puzzles of the levels i knew it was time to quit

laying down tracks is frustrating with a mouse and infuriating with a trackpad much of the game is going square by square to see where you can go losing a star sometimes for removing a track was just insult to injury

controlling the switches was also just way more work than it needed to be switches can be hidden by trees they can also be unusable next to a station unless you zoom in

a lot of my playtime is just from starting a level over because of some error from the previous two issues and theres also no option to save a games progress and come back later that probably added a couple hours as well

i really wanted to like this too the art style is way nicer the logic and progress of each level is far more interesting than the first game  i put so much time into it because those interested me but it just wasnt enough

#####

nice graphics funny gameplay my younger brother did enjoy it a lot
i wish developers make better tutorial as its little bit hard if u are not deep into train games

#####

i find the replayability and solving the puzzle to get 5stars on every level fantastic
overall this is a fun little game some levels are better than others but generally there is a good difficulty curve highly recommend even at full price

#####

the initial levels are fun but by level 10 you see this game is just layering more of the same original concept more trains fewer usable pathways higher costs per action and more convoluted sequencing

all you do is connect railways cluster trains around in nonsense landscapes with limited building space
it lacks a personal experience  in each level there is one best way to complete it to achieve 5 stars  pun intended players are railroaded to one best solution

there is no incentive for creativity or originality in your play style do it the one best way or lose stars

any single mistake is completely unforgiving  there is no rewind to fix a missed click there is no undo button for your actions after you spend 30 minutes or more on building a level  if you have even one tiny little mishap at the end of the level and you get to do the entire level all over again because of one tiny little error  you could carry on and complete the remainder of the level without earning full stars but you know that you will have to play the entire level over again later anyway just to earn those stars so might as well reset the level now  

for this being a minmax impersonal and unforgiving experience i cannot recommend it  the game is colorful fun nice sound effects fluid hud but behind all of the artwork is a scrub of a game  just quantity over quality i would prefer a game where the player has more choice and more additive learning curve as opposed to trial by reset failures

devs  if you read this consider adding a rewind 3 seconds button and also a periodic autosave  as a player i want to be able to just restore a prior part of the level where everything works because i spent a lot of time and shouldnt have to repeat the same abc to get to d just to figure out d   if i have a fail at d then let me reload at c not restart at a every time  this wastes sooo much time just doing all the same crap over and over to figure out those later steps  very annoying  very unsatisfying   

devs if your levels were not so linear so generic it might be more fun too  making limited pathways makes this a lot less fun  

sure train valley 2 is a bit of a puzzle game but when i solve a puzzle in real life the puzzle doesnt fail with one wrong move and then i have to throw it away  with real puzzles wrong moves can be undone and progress continues  please let players undo their moves and continue from the point prior to the bad move not at the beginning 

lastly time limits suck  get rid of timers for star rewards  coordination should get more reward than speeding in my opinion  i suggest replacing stars for speed with multiple other challenges  the game has all of these clever ideas for goals no crashes no destruction of property no upgrades etc but the one goal that you persist in every level is stars for speed 

this game should be called find the solution as quickly as possible without making a single error or else reset

overall train valley 2 is just a trashy little gimmick  unrefined and unfulfilling  dont spend money on it but its not bad for a freebie in a bundle

#####

what a gem  and i am picky af when it comse to giving positive reviews hell ive given days gone a negative one for not allowing me to unequip weapons and that game ruined my sleep schedule for months

there prolly are going to be levels that will kick my ass and make me rage but so far its a great selection of levels many have a unique twist to them 

panama canal took me around 5 tries long train kicked my ass several times i am currently playing frankfurt and that level added another twist to the game very nice


#####

train valley 2 exceeds the expectations set by the first game in every way 

it is designed more as a factory game where you are set about the task delivering workers to the various stations via train you must then deliver the finished goods back to the city to finish the game each stage has a set of 5 star goals with 3 of them being time based and two working more achievement based like the stamps in train valley the dlc pack also adds levels similar to the first game where you have to get trains to their destinations while still building goods set forth in the second game 

there are 50 stages in the base game 20 stages in the dlc and endless community stages available with the top 3 of the week appearing directly in game so you dont even have to go looking for community content the developers have curated it for you

i had a blast playing train valley 2 and i would whole heatedly recommend buying it with the dlc passenger flow

#####

this is a fun train management game even with only a portion of the promised content included the game feels very polished and enjoyable in my 27 hours i havent experienced a crash or glitch its a fun game and an entertaining sequel to the original train valley

#####

after 20 or so level it completly lost charm to me instead of finding optimal way to build railroads you have severel choke points that you need to solf with very limited possibilites offten only one  as map designer intended 

only way that game challange you is how optimal you can switching lines for best time 
and for me it not fun at all on normal speed is everything reaaaaly slow and on second speed its very flustrating to managing several place at once and keep eye on every swith if its aligned correctly at that moment

#####

although its entertaining i feel as if this game was intended to be part one and part one a much better version of this its completely different both in playability and graphics i encourage novelty and i think its appealing but it doesnt make me want to keep playing for hours like the first game did i didnt find myself feeling like coming back for more and i found the graphics too difficult to grasp and too uniform in the end it felt like a clicking game to me

#####

i loved train valley and although i initially preferred it as i play more of tv2 i realise this game is a bit better  its addictive laying tracks and trying to get the correct trains to the correct stations upgrading them so they carry another carriage and go that bit quicker and buying more trains so i can shift goods and people more efficiently  its easy to stuff up a single track route to have trains crash or go into the wrong station  but that is all part of the fun and puzzle aspect of the game  striving to get 5 stars on each challenge is also always achievable in my plays anyway but might take you a few goes which means a little bit of replayability for each map  

its also a fairly casual game you can get playing quickly many challenges can be done within half an hour and it is just easy to get playing quickly  its also a game you can pause for a long time or simply turn off and come back to later when you get the itch again  that can also be a bit of a trap because when i fire up the steam platform see what i did there analogy trains    and start to look through my games collection to work out what to play particularly if i just want to get into something reasonably fast invariably i end up playing tv2 because it is easy and addictive

there is also about 40 challenges or levels to play going through different industry periods so early ones have steam engines later ones as you progress through have diesel and electric trains so there is enough content to enjoy the game itself  

what also got me sold on this game is that there is the ability to create your own user maps and upload them for others who have the game to play in the games workshop menu  this is pretty damn good because there are literally dozens and dozens of user maps with their own challenges that all have user star ratings and you can subscribe to a map and then play it  this makes the replayability of this game almost infinite in many ways as more user maps keep coming out  as i have progressed through about half the main game  thats with over 200 hours clocked  i find myself often going to the user maps and having a go at those challenges  

enjoy this game quite a bit as clearly said above  i was a little reluctant at first because i really liked tv1 and the changes from coloured trains matching stations to different goods and passenger combinations didnt really appeal to me but once i played and got used to the changes its much better  if you liked tv1 i think this game is a must but otherwise still recommend for anyone interested in simple but addictive puzzle type games that have a bit of a train theme

#####

great sequel to train valley 1 basically its more challenging because of the new concept and the time limits to achieve stars but it also allows for more creativity because you can build bridges and tunnels and place them how you like overall would highly recommend especially if you are hot for cheevos 

#####

if you enjoyed the challenge in train valley
you may well enjoy the not so similar challenges in train valley 2
during the early access the conditions changed a bit to recieve all 5 stars per puzzle
and the changes imho were all to the better

with my humble approach to the game itself
i have personally not encountered any bugs
the time limit is the most challenging treat
and makes train valley 2 a worthy sequel
looking forward to more levels although
the presently 20 ones provide hours of mindbending

ive enjoyed 93 hours of it already
and i will likely play more even without more levels

 of course i am biased i love games i love fun and i love trains
  its a win win winconcept

#####

fantastic puzzle game waaaay more complex than the first one

took me about 42 hours to finish all 50 levels with 5 stars each the game starts rather simple and gets more complicated and challenging with each level especially 40 and up with the exception of one level which i was only able to beat the best time by a few seconds on the 5th try all challenges are fair and managable to accomplish

#####

train valley 2 is a resource management puzzle game  beat it in 36 hours using a mouse  difficulty is moderate then becomes really hard too hard in parts towards the end  

 first off the only thing trainvalley 1 and 2 have in common is they have trains and a grid system for laying tracks  after that they are very different games  where trainvalley 1 is about getting tracks down before the trains merrily fly off their rails to the point that the map almost looks like art train valley 2 is straight up sending trains to make materials then sending the materials where they need to go to win the level  

there are hills   with hills comes tunnels and bridges  unfortunately while this is a nice addition it is really hard to tell hill from normal land and a hill that can fit a track vs a hill that is just for show  so you end up spending a lot of your time especially in the later levels having to repeatedly test where on earth you can or cant lay track  sometimes youll put a bridge up to find your cant reach it  or youll bring tracks up a hill to find it isnt at the perfect angle and therefore youre stuck on the precipice  

levels  there are 50 levels total and a workshop where you can build your own or check out what others come up with   alongside that is the dlc which for some bonus cash gives you 20 more levels the workshop is very fun and worth it

stars  like tv1 each level has 5 stars  two challenge stars dont let trains crash etc and three time limits to beat  

83  above i mentioned how the game gets too hard  this is what too hard looks like  only 83 of people who got the game on steam and played it beat all 50 levels at the time of this review based on the achievement for doing so  that means if you get this you have less than a 1 in 10 chance of getting through it all   after level 40 some of the levels do get unfortunately far too hard and even earlier than that there are a few that really tested my patience because the solution was pretty impossible to find  on a few choice levels the solution is so obscure that i had to resort to looking at youtube videos to solve it which in turn pointed out just how much of a stretch or how broken the level design was to get to that conclusion  at one point the track i needed to access was unseen behind the graphic of the building at another you had to arrange the tracks in such a way to get power for the map but there was no heads up or nod previous in the game on how to do it on a few others the levels money is so strapped and the game harries your progress every step you take with obstacles that it gets overwhelming when you lose x times and cant find a way out of it  


in summary  if you have ocd and love resource management games despite what i said above you will heavily enjoy yourself  normal gamers will also have immense amounts of fun on at least the first half of the game and most definitely with the workshop  in fact if tv2 didnt have the last 10 levels or there was a better process for weeding out the impossible few bad designs that peppered the game im certain more would beat the game as a whole  however a great game like this one does have a level of too hard to it that even getting gud cant fix without the wonders of youtube to sort things  

normally if a game is too hard to beat id give it a thumbs down  but i was able to beat it with help  trainvalley2 didnt glitch out on me and there was nothing inherently faulty in the programming that bugged things out  and i did thoroughly enjoy myself  so train valley 2 gets a thumbs up for entertainment value  that and for not putting detroit in a desert

#####

a really fun game to play to just pass the time

#####

satisfying to play getting things just right is fun dealing with production chains avoiding crashes and building your railways keeps things interesting and theres a decent amount of variety in types of levels

#####

i love this game as you can tell from all my hours played the level of challenge is great and as well as the game coming with a lot of content 50 levels and another 20 in the current dlc  more dlc to come soon there are thousands of playercreated levels in the workshop

if you like logic puzzles you will really enjoy this

the graphics are cute and the sounds are nice but unobtrusive

i cant say enough nice things really  a very relaxing and enjoyable game


#####

im a massive fan of the first train valley game

its a nice little puzzle game that was fun to play train valley 2 does everything a good sequel should take what made the first game great and expand on it

train valley 2 plays differently than the first one theres no time limit like the first game but you will have to plan out your train routes in order to earn money and keep your system going it starts out easy but gets a lot harder as it goes on

there were times the game drove me insane but it felt so great to beat a level and figure out a solution the problem 

great puzzle game

#####

nothing like the first game  010

however standalone game   610


what i liked 
 first 15 levels or so are kind of fun but not as fun as tv1 train valley aka train valley 1


what i did not like 
 different style of game from the first one
 the maps leave little room for creativity of placing tracks  force you to build how they want
 new gameplay is about sending resources and producing products


nothing like the first train valley  this is now a resource management game with time limits and no longer about planning tracks and train schedules

basically youre playing like this   okay the home city needs 8 chairs so i need to send 6 workers to the lumberjacks to chop 6 more wood then while that is going send a train of  3 workers from home city to the lumber mill and have them be ready for when the wood comes in  oh wait i forgot i need to send 3 workers to the gold mine because i need 6 gold ingots still  okay now let me send 3 wood planks from the lumber mill to the chair factory       the placing of tracks is so boring the devs force you to build how they want  and you have a time limit to deliver the products to the home cities

#####

choo choo

#####

love this game someone might say its a chill game but it can be really stresfull if you want all stars

#####

dont understand why ppl said tv1 is better 
to me tv2 have more depth  replayability better graphics and musics
the only problem is that it takes quite a long time to finish a level

#####

its a fun version of the empirebuilding genre you need to quickly figure out efficient ways to build out your track network to complete the checklist of missions for each level in the shortest time the only negative is that scoring puts a high premium on speed

#####

i lost track of time and played till 4 am which hasnt happened in a while in other words great game

it took me about 6 hours to complete the current 20 levels and i am going to hunt all those stars next which is the real challenge here

the game is well desinged in the sense that it can be pretty relaxing game you can take your time and admire the scenery etc but to complete the levels with all stars can be pretty hard 

the trains are just so fun and cute and come on deploy another i can juggle em all no problem oh #1t this train is going wrong direction wait stop that train nonono a crash oh well there goes my workforce and precious chairs going into town where will the townfolk sit is there no god

there isnt another train game like this oneofakind really cool the satisfaction when you know exactly what is happening and there is 6 trains going on and you know where eveyrone is going and you go click clickety click on those switches to guide the trains ahh

#####

played up to level 25  its fun but the required effort to complete the level and get all stars does not feel rewarding if you like puzzle games give it a go it starts out simple enough but it can get tricky coordinating trains of different speedscapacities

#####

pretty fun and relaxing the game more like timemanagement puzzle then railroad building because of a bunch of custom levels in steam workshop has a lot of content to play this game worth to give it a try

#####

great game i appreciate how the devs took the concept of train valley and thought of how to make train valley 2 a little bit different i cant say that one is better than the other but i would say that i do prefer train valley 1 over this new one and was hoping for more of the same but tv2 is fun too

it took me about 12 hours to play through the 20 levels that are in the ea version of the game it was totally worth my 10 i enjoyed myself and ive got a game that i could play all the way through

im really looking forward to the full release with 30 more levels to play through and the level editor that level editor is going to be fun to play with and give us many more levels to play as the community produces them hopefully someone will come up with a level that is a little more hectic and even more challenging to play

a warning though there is only really one sound track and it just plays over and over again ive had it stuck in my head for days now and im looking forward to the day that i get something else stuck on an ininite loop in my brain

oct 2023 
id like to update my review here since its been a long time since i gave this game a thumbs up this is a fantastic little puzzle game which i believe can tickle the fancy of both a casual gamer who may find it a little bit of a challenge to get five stars on some levels to being ripe for masters of time and management to really sink their teeth in and be competitive with getting the fastest time on every level i love how i have the freedom to make my own decisions on where to build my tracks what layout ill have and what ordersizespeed of train to use ive now spent i think 550 hours with this game over the years its one of my top played games in my library and im looking forward to train valley world coming out the devs are supportive and responsive on discord and theyve done an amazing job of building up a community of really nice and helpful people there are some truly amazing players who are always very generous in showing us how they did a level and sharing what they know about the game my earlier review says i bought this game for 10 and sure ive bought every dlc along the way but theyre always packed with more levels and always worth it so thats 5 dlc at the time of writing at about 7 each grand total of 40 for this game which puts me at 7 cents per hour of entertainment thats bloody good

i can not recommend this game highly enough its entirely worth its current asking price of 1749 i would love to see it hit overwhelmingly positive because it deserves it

#####

the first few levels are actually fun because you have a choice and can place the tracks how you like but after that it is just paintbynumbers and you have to place the tracks where the devs reserved the place for you

#####

scratches a certain train itch

#####

i have to point out that while the game is in early access the only major difference they point out is that the full release will have 25 times more levels but very few other things than that right now i dont even find the game engaging enough to finish the first 20 levels

i loved the previous game but the changes made in this game in comparison to the previous one make the game less enjoyable to me in the first train valley trains would spawn randomly and you were only limited to how many trains you were personally able to track

this time around the game plays more like a puzzle game you sit down at the beginning of the level and plan out what you need to do then you execute this plan there is no randomness involved in fact in most cases there is only one viable solution to each level figuring out that solution is in most cases trivial which makes the game more of a chore than anything else

#####

very nice game i loved original train valley and even thou this has bit different mechanicsetc its also awesome game to play 
atm its early access but game works very well no bugsetc not all levels are there yet thou

i can recommend this game for everyone

update

now its out of early access and all levels are in some one the later levels are really hard but attleast i like that they are hard and not too easy

 update 2 

there is new dlc out also its also very good addition to the game so go and buy it

#####

i cant recommend it 

ive played first part and was looking forward to this one but after zeppelin and tunnel levels i have enough to earn full start you have to do everything exactly by the second the way the designer intended where is fun in this i was thinking it was some cool and pretty casual title 
it is not and getting stuck on the level and investing every time 15 to 20 minutes just to get to know that you was late 10 seconds not my cup of tea

only for maniacs dont let the graphic mislead you it is definetly not an cool and relaxing title

#####

please give me some recomendation game strategy like this im too exited playing game like this

#####

this game does not help you learn about it at all the tutorial is so basic it is a miracle if you get past the first level

#####

a little different from trains valley but still and enjoyable game

#####

id like to give this a positive rating but i cant the game changes the rules without any explanation theres a level called panama where you have to deal with flooding in the canal but there is absolutely zero explanation of how this mechanic works in advance of the flooding in another called golden gate delivery of goods to the nearest town arent accepted and there is no clear location where goods should be delivered searching for this solution the devs tell you in the forums that the order of resource delivery is important but thats unclear from the ui additionally there is almost no replay value on a map once youve achieved 5 stars on it and the reward for collecting stars on maps is purely aesthetic

pro
 trains
 bridges
 tunnels
 interesting production chains deliver goods to factories to make more complex goods to deliver elsewhere
 cute aesthetic

con
 the soundtrack is a single looped partial song which is not overly complex and begins to grate on the nerves after 30 minutes of play
 the telegraphing of mechanics and requirements degrades over time its good at first but on later maps half the complexity of the map is simply were not telling you the rules nyah nyah nyah this failure to teach players is what defines a poorly designed game
 all train movements are micromanaged theres no way to set up systems of behavior you have to click on each train
 train selection when youve upgraded one train and you want to use it over and over is tedious and unrealistic if you take your train from town to the wheat fields you can use that same train from the town to the wheat fields again

blah not pro not con but still commenting
 lots of maps are designed in such a way that there is only one way to successfully achieve 5 stars earns the puzzle game description but the lack of flexibility in gameplay saddens me
 keeping all your trains on track is a euphamism frequently map design means you have to send a single train across the entire map preventing any other trains from running to avoid crashes this eats away at your complete within x objective
 while the cash limitation initially is interesting at the start of a map it quickly becomes a largely irrelevant factor to gameplay if you dont care about collecting stars for train aesthetics you can take as long as you want and since achieving the nontime objectives two per map will always give you a minimum of 2 stars you can complete every map given enough time
 caveat if you waste your money and prevent yourself from expanding within the allowed initial budget you will have to restart because you cant just keep delivering workers to work places to earn money and not all goods will be accepted at town which is where the initial cash limitation is actually restrictive

this is not railroad tycoon expect a lot of tedium from the train valley 2 ui

#####

i bought this game with the 30 off coupon for those that owned train valley during early access
this is not train valley it is different but not in a bad way
this game is a lot more of a time and resource management game
im enjoying it so far 
i like the music i like the strategy i like perfecting the objectives

#####

a much improved version of the original game simple and fun good brain teaser game hope they bring out more scenerios into the future to keep it fresh

#####

long train level ruins this game for me turns from puzzle game to frustrating mess

#####

my nightmares used to relate to loss abandonment harm

they are simpler now and far more terrifying somewhere in all the mess of rails and supply chain management i missed a single switch

#####

great game

#####

its good but it has its major flaws too

the good
 trains
 feels rewarding when you get it or júst nail a sequence of trains crossing each other
 looks nice distinct atmosphere
 it still made me finish all of the fifty levels on five stars so there must be something good about it 
 thematic levels make sense

the mediocre
 most later levels are pretty much only about finding the perfect path to lay your rail then finish it off
 no point in earning more than you need other than the world rankings which youll never really top in most cases
 sometimes you forget about the stuff youre not allowed to to get the two extra stars would be more interesting for me to just lock them out of the gameplay eg not being able to stop trains and not upgrade engines

the bad 
 terrain can be really annoying especially when youre not allowed to destroy track tiles
 crossing tracks to get power so without a train being able to run from one to another is a bit of a not so logical mechanic
 no clue in game what a train will gain you upon delivering until you start that train more annoying in later level where you need to buy the stuff the train transports as well
 some levels i just looked up on youtube mostly the ones with the crossing tracks to get power i always thought there was a way to connect the rails in a way that trains can run from one to another part
 losing focus because its all going to easy then having one switch wrong and blowing it all in the final minutes then having to do everything over again

plenty of people have pointed out some stuff makes no sense at all like workers being consumed to produce goods but if you dont think about that too much

overall about 710
enjoyed some levels but no real replay value for me at the moment and some levels really annoyed me

#####

i have happily spent many many imanyi hours with this trainthemed puzzle gameor is it a puzzly train gamewhich has been kept fresh for five years now thanks to the constant attention of the developers and their cultivation of a lovely little community on discord

ive been playing games on home computers for over 40 years now starting with the likes of adventure apple galaxian and microsoft decathlon on my trusty apple iiwhich still runs and i would put place train valley 2 in my top 5 favorites of all time

#####

i played and enjoyed the first train valley and immediately jumped on this version when it was available as early access the mechanics are different from the original but i enjoy this version quite a bit more pretty early in the ea i played through the then 20 levels available and felt i totally got my moneys worth to come back later find another 10 levels 20 more official on the way and all the workshop stuff i now feel like i bought one game and got two more for free  im looking forward to the games continued development and that driving need i have to get every level done with all 5 stars and see where i can get on the leaderboards my only real complaint is that it can be hard to tell on some levels exactly what is possible to do with the tracks bridges and tunnels given the topology i like the stylized graphics quite a lot but i feel like theres a bit of room for improvement for the sake of playability

#####

nice puzzle game with both a nice tempo to it and a good level of challenge if youre obsessed with getting 5 stars on each map  ability to create and play other players maps makes for good replayability

#####

one of my favorite games and probably worth twice the price i got it when it was in early access and i played all 20 levels there are now 50 and was hungry for more now that its finally hit full release im falling in love with it all over again

do be warned that its rather different from train valley 1 i like it much more than tv1 but some people dont if you havent played either of them try both  but if you ask me try this one first

#####

a bit repetitive quite slow and punishing but i find thats kinda ok somehow

the most frustrating part is the challenge train crash dont stop wrong station etc where one iunawarei mistake focus on a specific part of the map and overlook other places cost half an hour of replaying the level wish there could be some kind of undo or rewind a few seconds before a disaster

still a decent micromanagement game overall

#####

the core concept is comparable to openttd but much simpler way less management aspects and less gameplay features which is why the longterm motivation is missing overall still a decent game for in between

#####

thought this one was a lot better than first version  timed requirements for stars are kind of a pain to get and some achievements require dlc but just finishing the levels without always going for 5 stars still pretty fun

#####

train valley 2 is a casual game were you build tracks and run trains to their destination in the shortest time possible

good nice style varied buildings good theme many welldesigned levels nice community with weekly challenges a level editor

bad there is no save option if you make a small mistake you may fail a level and start all over again for most shorter levels this is fine but for some of the larger levels this turns into grinding

weird some mechanics are fine game mechanics but at odds with the theme delivered goods vanish for example workers are turned into wood the trains can reverse on the spot while you have to transport goods available trains can miraculously depart from any station you choose

the game features 30 levels 50 with extra dlc and require different strategies based on what exactly is a scare resource in that level worker production limited or narrow tracks or small passes where all trains go through in others the slow trains or not enough money to upgrade trains or purchase buildings however the buildin levels are all a bit too wellbalanced so the variation in levels only became clear to me when i was playing communitygenerated levels available in the workshop some are real pieces of art and others pieces of personal frustration trying to solve them   the weekly lets play together is a great way to find real good levels so even if trains is not your thing you may still enjoy the game so be sure to check out the weekly challenges

conclusion i highly recommend this game despite the mentioned weird game mechanics this is currently my favourite game to illustrate all 1000 games i own on steam this is the one i spend most hours on go figure

#####

an allround improvement over the first game and what an improvement it is it looks gorgeous the ui is much improved and the mechanics refined you have to juggle an increasingly complex flow of goods along your rail network while building your rail network and expanding your stable its less pushy than the first game but no less challenging for it i highly recommend it

#####

uithis review was made the 1st of april 2018 comprising the contents of the early access launch version of train valley 2 iu

h1 dont forget your ticket to ride h1

train valley 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to train valley that we all have been patiently waiting for and not only does this game improve on the concepts and gameplay basics laid down by its predecessor but also manages to innovate and bring the gameplay one notch further thanks to the inclusion of new mechanics

h1 new mechanics are they greasy h1

fret not my concerned reader as the twists bends and general polishing that the product has undergone have resulted  in a substantially more satisfying game to play in this 2nd installment you can bdispatch your trains yourselfb which ive come to notice turns the game from the tense somewhat hectic gameplay of the original into a markedly more puzzly  endeavour as now there are b several resources b you have to deliver to the different itownsi and you have to really plan ahead as the space available and terrain features are rather constricting

your typical train valley 2 level then involves transporting people to different raw material producing stations iwood iron or gold ore coal wheati and afterwards ship those raw materials into a secondary processing plant that also needs workers where they will be converted into consumer goods iglass rubber bricks cows and so oni for then to finally ship the end product back into the town sometimes this process iterates on itself and it can be complicated iad infinitumi

also my memories are vague at this very moment but i want to think i recall tv1 not having tunnels andor bridges so maybe these are also a newly addition if so they are a welcomed inclussion to the title as they open up more possibilities moreover i reckon terrain is too a new feature again giving a little bit of nuance to the gameplay there are small irks i have with them but i will comment on them later on

h1 cute trains choo chooh1

i am quite pleased both with the graphical style and the interface design as they are approachable cute and cheerful maintaining the theme of tv the game looks great the trains change depending on what youre transporting not to mention the different maps have a lot of fluff to them to give them flavour it definitely is an aesthetically pleasing title 

h1 trains only go forward h1

i mean well not on this game as you can pivot a train 180º degrees on itself but im willing to suspend my disbelief when it comes to it however i would like to make use of this review for politely asking maybe for a mode where you cannot do that or a challengestar conditionwell talk about this later  i am aware theres an editor in the works well come back to that too however i am not 100 sure of the scope of it and i dont know if something as a basic mechanic can be changed or if you will have to program your triggers for star conditions or theres a preset array of them to choose from banyways please let me not be able to pivot trainsb

at the moment of this review i have beaten with either 4 or 5 stars the content that was available at launch u20 levelsu which is fair however because of the type  of game and the previous record of the involved devs i assume the title will continue to be worked upon until it releases adding b more levelsb and the promised u map editoru 

now considering this is a title in progress i would like to comment on a couple of problems i have faced within the game

 the framerate tanks a lot when building either tunnels or bridgesfor as long as you are using the respective construction tools and you can build them with the game paused so it does not necessarily affect you much however sometimes it can take a little bit for the tunnelbridge to appear and there are a bunch of weird tunnel spots that lead out of the map and completely wreck my fps i must say that the game does not suffer from this when either using the ibuild tracksi or the irailroad switchi tools

 the tutorial prompts look like placeholders to me as they are rather plain difficult to dismiss and to be honest they kind of clash with the aspect of the rest of the game

 this might be that i am bad at the game but sometimes i found theres not much leeway for error specially when you are starting the level as a misplaced rail might mean restarting the level because now its unbeatable its the bdark soulsb of train simulators

 some of the mission star conditions are not wanting to be rude a tad nosensical i mean i get the one that you gotta take trains to the wrong station and i can work with that and i can work with overspending money for the star even if i dont really want to or having to send more trains than whats ioptimali however the one where you have to crash 3 trains i definitely do not like that one one bit as it goes against everything and unless you purposefully crash 3 trains near the very end  its going to set you back a lot considering tracks explode and leave debris and you have to repair the engines

h1 all aboard last call h1

in a nutshell i recommend buying train valley 2 even at its current unfinished state as it took me around 8 hours to beat it which i consider a rather fair amount of content for the 7 price tag it has some minor issues but its completely playable and in my opinion an enjoyable experience that has a lot of good prospects going forward

#####

wow  this game is fantastic  each level is a joy to look at and and an even greater joy to figure out how to solve in record time and get a full star rating  i am addicted  the charm of games like railroads with an addictive puzzle element  it comes with a really nice number of levels plus an editor  already there are hundreds of user made levels  i will be playing this for some time come  great job developers

#####

even though this game isnt finished yet what is there frankly feels like a full game  its just waiting for some more levels

fans of the original train valley will love this its been updated so the game play is different but its familiar enough that youll get into the swing of it straight away

if youve not played train valley then i highly recommend you get them both

simply sublime  everything is just so well thought out

#####

fantastic evolvement from tv1 

however hold off on buying till complete theyre not adding levels 2150 until release

#####

i was looking forward to playing this game since the moment it was announced tv2 basically builds on the first game and makes it a whole lot more fun similar to tv1 your job is to dispatch trains and control their flow through the tracks by building demolishing and toggling the switches tv2 builds on this idea and adds a new layer  production chains so in addition to the key elements of tv1 theyve added a key concept this time around  maximise supplymanufacturing efficiency leading to a healthy production chain

ive played just 15 hours so far and ive had a blast

thanks for the great game so far

#####

great game i think it was a widely different but acceptable progression from train valley i really enjoyed the passenger flow dlc which brought back a tv1 vibe back to tv2 i am definitely looking forward to train valley 3 if and when it comes out

#####

a very relaxing game if you ignore the objectives which there isnt really a penalty for or try to hit the goals for a more fast paced playthrough really enjoy both at different times

#####

not as good as the original train valley can be a bit fiddly trying to route the trains on some maps leaving you with some really messy layouts  there are some bits where you need to connect two bits of the tracks together for power but you end up just putting a random section of track in to allow it  not a logical bit of route very hacky theres no undo functionality meaning you cant try things without spending money which may leave you short if you have to demolish and retry something else resulting in a restart of the map

#####

a youtuber spoke highly of this ages ago and i picked it up seeing it discounted i have not played train valley 1 for comparison

i really like this game and the praise others have given it is welldeserved but there is one important caveat merely getting through each level at all is very easy the difficulty comes from figuring out how to do them efficiently enough to get 5 stars if you are not the flavor of completionist who is driven to get a perfect rank on every level and arent just looking for something to zone out to there might not be much compelling for you here if you are that flavor of completionist keep one eye on the clock

#####

a simple train game thats easy to learn and fun to watch  i have just about every train game out there and some of the more elaborate ones are challenging but they are also frustrating  train valley 2 is never frustrating and the failures can be downright hilarious  i highly recommend this game

#####

very relaxing game sometimes

#####

one of the greatest train based resource management puzzlers of the last decade

#####

love this game i play it daily average 40 hours a week other players add their own levels which you can play these are uploaded daily hours of funif you like these type of games new dlc content coming soon


#####

httpsyoutubet6qlys7g_mw

finicky and unforgiving the difficulty for 3 stars is a turnoff but the general style and structure of solving bite sized logistic challenges is more than satisfying

#####

truly recommended to everyone in love with tiny trains it starts slow but eventually becomes a game that offers all of the depth and meditative values of serious train sims but with softcorecasual like progression enjoying every bit of it just like snacks

#####

this is a puzzle game but there are trains in it soooo i like it

#####

well designed game with relaxing graphics and sound runs on linux pleasantly surprised by this one

#####

this is a fun puzzle game with the theme of optimizing transport logistics

youre graded primarily on how fast you can complete each level but you can pause as much as you want build while paused and the clock stops while the game is paused so whats important is building efficient layouts not high apm or anything like that

theres a minor economics side to this puzzle as well as transported goods generate money building rails cost money and you can also use money to upgrade locomotives or buy additional locomotives this can open up different strategies on how you tackle some of the larger levels

#####

i prefer this over train valley 1 and it has workshop support

however the first few levels are a bit boring if youve completed the first one which might be the cause of all the bad reviews

#####

switching from rng spawns to a fixed layout and production chains is a huge improvement over the first game now you no longer get screwed because rng hates you but you can plan your strategy and try to get the best times

additionally this game fixes many little annoyances of the first game for example switches are no longer blocked just because a train is nearby and curves no longer demolish additional tiles

and with workshop support there is content for hundreds of hours
 

update 112021 the game is still receiving support with bugfixes qol improvements workshop contests and even occasionally new features 100 recommendation 

#####

nice and relaxing game

#####

i love the way this game forces you to really strategize with which resources you need and how much money you can make from them to build railroad tracks bridges tunnels etc ive enjoyed playing the first 15 levels of this game a lot not to mention the graphics are great this is a great looking game definitely recommend to players looking for a satisfying management game that is very pleasing to play and look at

#####

if you liked train valley you will love the sequel new mechanics and very replayable levels are challenging and there is a lot of downloadable content also buy the dlc it does introduce a very interesting mechanic that it is very fun

#####

clever and addicting  this combines strategy and critical thinking skills as you solve puzzles against the clock i didnt think i would enjoy this but my best friend kept on me to try it finally i understand just how well crafted it is it stands alone in the genre

#####

this game is very fun and challenging i like it very much

#####

mmm nice

#####

train valley 2 is a strategic puzzle logistics management game you are asked to build tracks and transport goods to several points and this way complete the production chain in order to do so youll need to provide overview mutitasking planning and timing skills the game is based on single levels which take increasing time and come at a increasing difficulty some people complain about the game being too easy but at the same time they admit they only played like four levels if you play all the levels and try to finish them the best way possible 55 stars the game gets a lot trickier pretty fast 

of course level based games like this do come with the problem that you might want to know what to do once you mastered all the levels the answer is easy tv 2 adds a heck of a lot depth and i mean it with bonus levels from the workshop right now there are more then 600 community build levels out there and the game itself suggests you to take a look at them by adding the workshoplevel shortcut on the main menu they even add a weekly leveldesigning contest and other special contest based on workshop maps 

i also bought the passengerdlc which comes at a price of 499  and adds 20 more levels to the basegame aswell besides the new levels it also adds transporting passengers aswell as goods 

after all i can just recommend you this game as its a lot of fun and comes with way more depth then you might think at first

#####

review after playing for about 35 hours

gameplay isnt necessarily more fun than the first game arguable but its different in a good way there are a lot of new things to think about both are surprisingly fun and addictive

i actually preferred the old graphics but it is easier to understand the grid when placing tracks now slopes can sometimes be misleading though audio is still pleasant and relaxing

workshop support should provide a ton of content

#####

i love train valley 2 i bought it without big expectations i liked the first one and was available day1 on linux so this was enough for me to try it there are 50 maps each one is a puzzle where you have to connect zones producing unites workers wheat  to zones consuming them each delivery bring some cash you can spent to build more rail tiles bridges tunnels buy one more train or upgrade one in each map to reach all the stars you need to fulfill all the goals in the same play of the map among completing in x minutes build no bridges build not too much tiles etc

if you like challenging puzzle in a train theme the game is for you but you can also play for fun building your network is fun in itself

#####

if you are looking for a game to pass a lot of time having fun with trains then this is the one for you very addictive and difficult which creates the right balance of not being too easy but not being so hard that you will give up for me its one of those rare games that i want to finish

#####

great little puzzle game not hard yet not easy fun for wasting an hour here or there   saws some negative reviews this game doesnt deserve negatives

#####

i love this game i cant stop playing honestly the first one is good as well this one even better and more challenging totally worth it

#####

i love the changes and additions since train valley  it makes it even more puzzley
its early access but feels like a fully finished game
theyve added more levels and mixed in the classic style with the new style
great improvement during early access

#####

when i wrote this 35 of the content was released 3 ages with additional mechanics introduced as time went on
you can probably finish the game in 510 hours except that ive manage to spend 250h in the community generated maps until now finishing most of the maps there as well

this game is addictive and i cant wait for the next communitygenerated maps

if youve already played the 1st game its more of that with a couple new mechanics
if you havent its a juggling game youre throwing trains in your rail network and need to pay attention if you dont want everything crashing into everything else abusing the pause key helps most of the time

should you play the 1st game before buying this game no the usergenerated content already dwarfs anything you could get in the 1st game

#####

incredibly fun and clever puzzlemanagementtycoon game even though it hasnt been released with every level it still provides endless fun the workshop community for this game and the developers are also pretty active meaning that youll never run out of maps to solve even after finishing every single regular map in the game at five stars go get it it is loads fun

#####

fantastic little train game challenging but not maddening great visuals and interface got this on sale and absolutely value gem 5 of 5

#####

suprised this game is still in ea however it is beautifully built upon the similar concept of the first train valley and adds new flair that makes it fresh the graphics are a little better and there are added complexities that keep you on your toes trying to keep up 

loved train valley you will probably like train valley 2 

for those of us who played through contless times on the first game its a nice and welcome change

#####

train valley is one of my favorite puzzle games ever train valley 2 is not just a prettier rehash of the first game it is vastly improved and incredibly fun

#####

the resource system is a great improvement on the first game i love both

#####

train valley 2 is a very good game and its price justifies what you get its unique in the puzzle that it provides yet very easy to wrap your head around its concept when the level editor comes in which i believe it will due to how positive the review are for all their games it would be endless fun for little price 

the only negative is that we no longer have trains going on their own like in train valley 1 the concept was good as it was and id love to see the devs add some levels which are train valley 1 style or for us to have this option in the editor when it comes out

youd love train valley if you loved games such as overcooked and snake pass

#####

great game with a ton of thinking involved you start out having a city with workers and a production site that needs some workers to make materials such as logs you build your own train tracks and can dispatch a worker train to the production site to produce logs then they can be delivered back to the city to complete the objective there is a whole campaign mode with tons of fun challenging ways to produce materials and get them back to the city in some levels the environment around you will change such as a volcano erupting and blocking off areas requiring you to redirect trains and figure out how to get trains to their destination aside from the campaign there are several fun dlc packs as well as thousands of user created levels to be found in the steam workshop compared to train valley 1 this game has endless content for tv1 i beat all the levels  dlc pack with the max amount of stamps stars in only 16 hours much greater value can be seen in train valley 2 as i have logged over 300 hours i would highly recommend giving this game a shot as there is a great community to be discovered lets play together events are held every week in the discord server lots of fun to be had

#####

beautiful sequel to tv1 the different goods add a nice layer of complexity on top of the established puzzles of track building and train routing

#####

good one for any one that like micromanagement and puzzles with a train thematics
great aesthetic and good mechanics

since is in early access i hope to see more scenarios and new mechanics

#####

ive always enjoyed a puzzle and train valley 2 does not let you down i have been addicted to this as i have been with conduct deluxe but with a big difference ive could plan the route i want to achieve the goals 

if you struggle with any level check out my videos on a 5star challenge on youtube  urlhttpswwwyoutubecommurphyplays1 murphy plays url


#####

the new manufacturing mechanic changes the puzzle substantially and adds a fresh challenge but this sequel has the familiar feel of the original game

#####

this game the best i loved train valley one because it was so addictive this title only improves on the last cant wait for the final product

#####

a great sequel to its predecessor train valley 2 takes all of the mechanics of the first game and polishes and improves upon them it also adds a layer of complexity as it has a supplyanddemand aspect rather than just needing to send trains to their corresponding colored stations much like the first game the levels are satisfying to begin with and the goals attached to each encourage you to play to 5stars on each level overall im very satisfied with this game even in early access

#####

way way too hard needs at the very least a checkpoint system

the first levels are very nice its different from train valley 1 but not necessarily worse or better

from the middle of the game though its an exercise in pure frustration 2030 minutes levels will go to hell if you get distracted for just two seconds a train will go the wrong way because another train moved a switch 30 seconds before bad design there btw it should either return to the previous way or do a honking noise so you notice and crash or go to the wrong station or drop the goods in a station that is already full and in the way youll fail one of your five stars again extra points if you know you effed up but cant do absolutely nothing to avoid it because the level wont let you stop trains or modify tracks

so do you mind playing level after level without getting the best possible score then there is a lot to like here

do you have ocd and need to do the 5 stars before moving to the next level prepare to be incredibly frustrated as you play the same level again and again and again horribly spoon murderer vibes there failing it with one minute to go and then failing the next 5 times in the first 3 minutes because youve done them 50 times already and you are on autopilot

youve been warned im recommending it but with a huge blinking warning sign

ps oh unlike the train valley 1 you cant pick up a star here and another one in the next try you need to do all 5 at once or it doesnt count another big mistake imnsho

#####

puzzle game not so much of a industry game if thats what your looking for then shes all yours but personally not my cup of tea

#####

enjoying every minute of this game
 and better that the first one  

thumbs up 

#####

ive been a fan of the first title and instantly bought this one as soon as it was released the devs do a great job with patching it and theyre always adding new and exciting content

a real recommendation to anyone who enjoys puzzlestrategy games its perfect for a few rounds inbetween and not as easy to master as it may seem at first

#####

my favorite game highly recommended good for busy people can play in short sessions and can safely leave kids at home with it as well i actually started with train valley then train valley 2 was a logical next step keep up the good work

level editor turned out to be a valuable feature i would not use it myself but my son got excited with it so i was also pulled in polishing his workshop creations it is surprisingly easy and fun to use and lots of good levels created by community as well

#####

for anyone who played the original train valley this is not the same kind of game not a successor to shortline of the early 90s that being said its still enjoyable kind of a middle ground between the original and a tycoon game  you still do the same thing but have more control over what happens and how and your only constraints are time limit and objectives

on that note i maintain that devs should remove objectives that restrict or dictate use of basic game mechanics such as dont use pause or even better for each objective of that sort add another optional objective that can be completed instead if the player feels like it like dont use pause or build no less than 75 tracks actually i think its a good idea to consider optional objectives so that each level will present slightly more opportunities than is required for a top score

also it will be nice to have a use for those gold stars aside from bragging rights for example upgrading your train company between missions cheaper tunnelsbridges track upgrades say level 1 is your usual track level 2 is 20 cheaper to build level 3 can be built on steep slopes at the cost of slowing down trains going on those slopes level 4 halves that slowdown and level 5 allows to build threedirectional switches train upgrades faster accelerationdeceleration cheaper repairs the sort of thing that isnt covered by upgrades on the level station upgrades shortened production cycles and othersuch stuff and on the top upgrade level a second entryway  for each type of building separately of course

all in all this game is definitely worth getting into even now

#####

puzzle game move resources to make products to deliver them by rail  very engaging casual game

id even recommend full price which is a rarity but these devs are super friendly and responsive to any question or suggestion i have ever put forward

only issues i am aware of are with greater than 1080 resolutions causing some scaling issues for people but hasnt impacted me

#####

хорошая тренировка перед поездами в факторио


#####

such a nice chill game loved the first one this is nice improvement easy for just casual play but also challenging when you want to 5 star everything

choo choo

#####

this game is really fun and far different from train valley 1 here you dont just direct trains to their stationhere you must manage ressourcessend stuff to different factories to produce items that need to be transported to cities to complete the levelthis has 30 campaign levels at the time with the first 10 being steam agethe next 10 industrial age and the last 10 being eletrical age plus some levels have some eventsadditionally you can build your own bridges and tunnelswell you cant build them anywhere you wantthe spots where you cam build them is pre set by the levelalso be careful with your cash at the startits very easy to screw upoverall i very like this game the levels are beatifuly made and the steam workshop adds infinite possibilities

at its heart train valley 2 tv2 is an optimization puzzle where you need to decide on what to do first then second while executing tasks that can be run concurrently within constraints but it is presented in a charming train routing manner add different ages of locomotives and some charming scenarios that are not too difficult and not frustrating multiple degrees of success and you have a good casual puzzle game 

tv2 as the name suggests is about building trains and connecting resources and places that needs them everything has been abstracted so your decision is purely on laying track and switching where the trains should go 

typical gameplay gives you a blank map and a couple resource points you typically start with two stations with third and fourth you need to connect to later the first home station provides workers and typically needs certain amount of resources transported back to it however those resources may require further processing 

for example your home station provides labor and needs six units of sand to the east is a sand pit where if you send in labor it will produce sand as needed for every unit of labor you send in next item it needs is wheat and theres a wheat farm to the west same idea send it labor it will make wheat finally to the north is a ranch it needs both labor and wheat to make beef so you need to send wheat to that and labor two different sources make enough beef and get it back to homebase 

you do have route control but you need to flip the railroad switches at each branch yourself as trains are not the fastest you need to time them correctly in order to use the least time but keep in mind one of the goals is to not have any crashes you can earn up to 5 stars on a scenario 1 for not crashing 1 no wrong station sending something to a station that doesnt need it and up to 3 depending on how fast you met the goals the more stars you get the faster you unlock upgrades such as locomotives that can haul more cars faster speeds and so on you can pause and resume a train and even turn it around 

the graphics blocking cartoonish type in 3d work not really voxely but in that sort of lowpoly style 

the problem is the isometric view prevents you from getting some details that are crucial in the layout of your tracks you cannot place track on ground thats sloped multiple ways and that often happens on hills so finding a proper path through the hills can be difficult 

furthermore tracks can only be joined two at a time with complex joins you need to spread them out and flat terrain can be very difficult to find in the hills  there is a bulldozer for you to delete a section and reroute 

when the map gives you option of both bridges and tunnels things can be complicated as tunnels are expensive but gives you a nice straight path through while bridges can link two land masses directly rather than going the long way around 

optimizing the flow is not that difficult at least initially im sure things get tougher as time goes on and there are dozens and dozens of scenarios plus a dlc to play through if you like relatively calm optimization puzzles and this is pausable with up to 3 levels of time compression this is worth trying

#####

despite simple rules btrain valley 2b puzzles provide good and challenging fun not only for train enthusiasts lovely visuals and a multitude of themed locations create colourful maps however they could be a bit more varied in terms of gameplay setup and more clear there are some fun achievements to add to the star gathering the game could use some polish on track laying the abovementioned cityproduction building placement and more precise communication for trains and maps still totally recommend

#####

to echo the other reviewers tv2 has a fundamentally different dynamic than the first but in my opinion its a huge improvement while tv1 was chaotic and required justintime arrow management tv2 pushes back into the direction of sane careful strategy youre building on larger maps managing predictable resource delivery patterns rather than flexing around random unpredictable passenger delivery and at least in the first ten levels you can take as long as you want though being efficient with your time gives you a bonus score beautiful graphics update the music sounds less offtheshelf and the keyboard controls are much smarter wasd is there though it would have been nice to be able to pitch  rotate

its still a casual game but one that i can definitely see myself coming back to possibly even beating all 50 levels eventually

#####

really fun the sequel isnt just more of the same  the game improved a lot and it is now quite a lot more puzzly and deep 

its already a good game and devs have a track record of doing early access well and actually implementing community suggestions only reason to wait till release is the fact that its a bit of a one shot game i never came back to train valley 1 and i expect ill miss 40 levels not yet made as well still happy with my purchase

only thing id change is those dumb special level tasks i dont ever want to crash or mismanage trains on purpose i dont want to spend more money than i have to those are annoying

there are some minor control quirks and performance issues but for an early access game its really solid

edit ok just lost my save 19 levels deep not as solid as i initially expected

#####

train valley 2 is a great sequel to a great puzzle game instead of just copying the formular of the first game the developers decided to change the style of the gameplay while keeping the core identity 

in this game you have different production facilities and you need to transport goods to towns factories or construction sites to fulfill objectives
production facilities need workers and sometimes other resources so you have to juggle trains between your stations and keep your production going if you want to beat the levels in record time
your main tool are railways that you can lay down connect two stations and your trains can travel between them create your own network of railways however you want but keep an eye on your income because if you run out of money you cannot build anything anymore 
you can send multiple trains at the same time but keep in mind that trains on the same railway can crash into each other or they might crash into each other on intersections your job is to avoid this so you dont have to pay money for the cleanup
additionally you can build more trains or even upgrade your trains so they can transport more goods and move faster but faster trains also mean you have to keep better attention
the game allows you to pause at any time and still be able to build change the direction at intersections or even flip a train so it move in the opposite direction this may not accurate for train physics but it keeps furstrating moments low

the levels offer different kind of challenges to provide extra fun often you have to beat the game under specific times build with a slittle money as possible or keep the environment intact these extra challenges give you stars to show that you mastered a level getting more stars unlocks alternative skins for your trains and if you have 5 stars on a level you can also see your stats in the leaderboard

compared to the first game this one is a more relaxed experience and if you dont want to go for the best times you can play the game at your own pacing
its a great game for fans of puzzle games and trains

#####

after playing tv1 i was so looking forward to this game
and it is not bad you can get enjoyment from it as such but it is not a sequel to tv1 the entire concept is changed now and now it is more like train tycoon instead 
sorry i was so looking forward to the game but i returned it

#####

big fan of the first one and they added a whole new layer of puzzles with the second while the first was a race against time to juggle your trains to their respective stations before you ran out of money this one has you directing trains to stations to create various building materials and then sendnig them off to whoever needs them completely different strategy is needed in this one compared to the first one no more building giant roundabouts this game and the levels that were created really force you to think about the paths you build and what is the most cost efficient route

graphics and music are very similar to train valley 1 which can be good or bad depending on your opinion of the first and what youre looking for in the second the ability to upgrade and buy new trains is a great addition and another level of money management a sequel needed to not be so similar to its predecessor this could have been a mediocre sequel with the same old formula that was safe but ultimately dlc with a number 2 tacked on but instead it has some real thought behind it and i believe it will give you hours of fun trying to hit 5 stars 

hint after you meet 5 stars the game compares you to everyone else playing the game and how well they did which is a fantastic inspiration to keep gettnig better and become that train master

#####

a great relaxing game highly recommend the puzzles get challenging but that just adds to the satisfaction of completing

#####

the game is made up of a bunch of mini puzzles featuring trains and track building theyre pretty nice take at most 30 minutes and feature side objectives if you want extra stuff to do once you complete the main game theres also workshop levels for extra fun
overall pretty neat little game ive got 5 hours in it and im only halfway through the campaign so the campaign might take a little while longer than that

#####

i have nothing to say other than i absolutley love this game and the two dlc expansions

#####

this is an awesome game
thank you for creating it ive played the first part and it was very nice but second is even better
to tell the truth  it was one of the things that i really wanted to make myself to create the game about cities and trains like this thanks for creating this game i wish i was able to be part of development team 

the game is very nice and friendly it is not overly complicated and realistic and this creates unique atmosphere the mechanics is really good design and graphics are very warm i really likes sound and music too

#####

it isnt train valley its not simple and the mechanics have changed slightly i like the first one better but this one is a fine sequel in the franchise

#####

in 3 points scale id give it 2 when im asked if i recommend it or not my answer is no if you havent played train valley 1 you should definitely buy that game instead of this one if you played tv1 you are probably going to be disappointed

why
the game is super easy i dont even know if its even possible to bancrupt in this game i mean its easy because getting all achievements in any level isnt challenging
the whole game formula changed now it isnt just different its no more unique and now games 100 predictable also its no more a puzzle game 
in tv1 player could only build tracks but stations popped up at random and dispatched trains randomly that was intensive required a lot of micro management rebuilding tracks to allow for increased train flow now you have like little goals to perform on the map every station is set from the very begining and you decide if theres even train to dispatch from one to another 
theres no collision avoiding no time pressure nothing that made the first one entertaining stopping train in the middle of nowhere is no more punished if u screw you can just stop all trains and send them where you want one by one in tv1 such mistake would either make you bancrupt or took away your chance for certain achievements

maybe this game is good if i dont know you want to relax with some unchallenging title and you like trains but if you are looking for universal solid gameplay experience you should choose train valley 1

#####

httpsyoutubeyq7tsk2uztu

a casual train puzzle which is really fun to play i like games that are made for everyone and when playing you can either play to finish a map and get whatever stars you can how i like to play or you can try and 5 star every map the way my wife plays no matter how you do it the levels are well thought out and fun with dlc releases and updated content still coming from the devs 

i have attached some gameplay above so you can get an idea if it is the kind of game for you but i would recommend it

#####

amazing casualpuzzle game in my opinion the perfect sequel to the first train valley the core idea of the game is the same yet expanded in all direction better graphics better maps better depth you are not just moving letters around you manage entire production chains amazing community creating custom maps and each week 2 are featured in the competition hosted by the developers

#####

codeurlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomcurator33025671missitheachievementhuntress please see my curator page for more games that are worth your time urlcode

info game 
the principe of this game is the same as in its predecessor you have to build railroads and manager trains to bring items from one station to another station in this version there is less luck i would say no luck at all the puzzles on the other hand are a bit more complex you dont only need items to the right station but also people to work in those places and for example to farm cows you also need grain to that place which is made in a totally different place the challenges from its predecessor are also back in this title but they feel a bit harder to complete since there is less luck the developers seem to want you to really try the optimal way with your researches to be able to complete the levels with 3 stars for the time you completed it in there are also 2 extra challenges every level like not to crash trains or not bring items to the wrong station 

info achievements
most of the achievements are straight forward or ones you can complete easily with some planning you have achievements for completing x levels no matter how many stars build so many tracks paused the game so many times stuff like that the hardest achievement will be to get all the 250 stars that means that you have to success on all the challenges on each level you dont have to do the time challenges at the same time as the two extra challenges it is totally possible to do them separately but getting all the stars will not be an easy task

pros  cons
 smooth gameplay
 has even more challenges than the predecessor
 challenging achievements will take some time to complete them all

#####

this game has already sucked a lot of life out of me and its still in ea

#####

got it in a bundle but it punches way above its weight criminally overlooked

it constantly comes up with new concepts all the way to the end has workshop support including a ton of excellent levels and the single music track is perfectly chill and never got old even after 50 hours campaign completion took me this long

the level layouts usually imply a single solution but not always and even within that there is freedom in creating varying track exchanges this gets combined with deciding howwhen to send trains to form the puzzle mechanic its satisfying it also has plenty of challenge and very rarely does it feel unfair

it does have a few minor problems the chief of which is that sometimes the mental load gets too high when there are trains all over the place and too many track branches coming back on another day has helped me avoid this though the rest are too insignificant to mention

ive only seen 1 maybe 2 bugs

overall its a delight

i have not played the first but plan to pick up that and the dlc for this one too

#####

absolute gem of a game its a very well crafted very cute little puzzle game in the guise of a transport tycoon esque sim

the graphics are quite well made and the interface is quite slick only the menus lack a bit of polish

overall very charming would be a great fit for the ipad as well

#####

this is an oddly addictive title i didnt really get into the first but this one grabs you from the start its very much a just one more turn game it can be incredily frustrating but because of that doing well is incredily rewarding also the graphics are absolutely gorgeous

really fairly priced and makes it definitely worth it it already feels very polished for an early access game

#####

i really like the tv2 imho it is a great improvement over the first one eg we dont just move the trains between cities but now we need materials delivered as well cute graphics fun puzzles and very addicting the only thing i dont like is that it is very short 20 levels and i hope they will add more if there will be no more content this game should sell for about 499

#####

so far whats here in early access is pretty fun with plenty of levels that can take between 515 minutes each so far

unlike the first game there are discrete delivery goals and no more random boring station colors now youre thinking ahead about connecting stations based on what resources the industry stations want and which towns those finished goods needs to go to its a compelling puzzlelite that doesnt punish you for being inefficient and rewards your efficiency with gold stars

there doesnt seem to be any procedural generation this time around which isnt a bad thing it didnt add much to the first game and id rather the developer put some thought into building a level to make it fun instead of worrying about whether procedural generation system will break things besides steamworks integration for playermade levels appears to be in the works which is a nice addition for a lower priced game

the fact that the core scoring and completion mechanic of the game has changed so much means that you can still go back and have fun with train valley 1 which is pretty nice for 10 7 with tv1 owner discount this is a fun way to scratch a light logisticsbuilder itch for at least a couple of hours

#####

wasnt as thrilled with this as i was with the first train valley  i thought it would be much more fun to actually have a purpose to travel to stations ie deliver goods to stations requiring them rather than just directing trains to stations because thats where they randomly chose to go

however the gameplay just felt flat  i never felt pressured to keep up the pace like i did in the first game  i know one of the challenges in each level is to beat it in a certain time limit but that never really made me feel under the gun  in tv1 when you had trains randomly spawning in stations knowing they could pop out at any minute really put the pressure on

im sorry i had to refund it but it just wasnt as great as i thought it would be  ive since gone back to tv1 and enjoyed it that much more

again one of those situations where i hate being forced to either thumbs up or thumbs down a review  its neither in this case but just a flat maybe  but since the devs seem pretty good ill give them the thumbs uphope their next game can have that same magic that tv 1 had for me

edit

i have now received this game via humble choice and im very happy that i did  i will be purchasing the passenger flow dlc which addresses the main point of my review which was the frantic gameplay of the first game  really excited to dive back into one of my surprise favorite games with a new mode  thanks humble and thanks to the devs for realizing one of the parts of the original game and what made it so great and bringing it back to the sequel

#####

tv2 is a great game that can be relaxing and challenging if you want to get 5 starts on each level in particular the time management stars take some planning i find otherwise if you just want to relax and get trains from point a to point b then i recommend this game also the trains and art are cute

#####

simple but fun puzzle game perfect for multitasking or when you only have 30 minutes to game

#####

unlike its predecessor train valley 2 is a much more difficult game with the same mechanics players have to look into what rail line to be built and when to send trains to departure 

the first few levels are pretty easy and relaxing however as the game progresses levels are getting harder and harder which actually require a lot of skills at management thats the reason why i felt bored as essentially every level is somewhat the same just with different terrains different locations and different resources 

h1the game makes me feel exhausted rather then relaxed as one level can cost almost 20 mins although you can expedite the process which i do not likeh1 i would not recommend this game if you want to just look for fun and relaxation

#####

a really cool evolution of train valley 1 adds more depth to delivering cargo even if it does lose a little bit of the puzzle element

#####

whilst the game is enjoyable it does not quite live up to the standards of the first game it is more challenging which is good but some of the funfactor has been lost compared to the first game it feels more like train valley 15 than a new game

that said it is still a fun game and worth playing

#####

had a blast with this game  each level is a mixture of solving a puzzle whilst getting timings right especially is youre going for perfects that left me with a very satisfied feeling when i cracked it

#####

so refreshing

#####

quite different than the first part and much better less randomness and much less annoying

#####

better graphics and game play from the first one very enjoyable the challenges allow to multiple plays of the game unless you manage to win all of them the first playthrough

#####

no freedom no relaxing no chill just puzzles and over complicated things that i dont want to do i had a lot of fun on the first game but train valley 2 is just boring

#####

i love the graphics but as a fan of transport tycoon this game feels annoying to play there is too much micro management and its not relaxing to play like many builder games but stressful because of the time limits track building is also very annoying and it rarely does what i expect it to do

there are two things this game has above transport tycoon and that is graphics love the cute lowpoly and the fact that towns factories etc have needs that you need to fulfill

its an ok game but i cannot recommend it

#####

i enjoy the puzzle aspect of trying to coordinate your trains to be the most efficient as possible in order to get the most stars per level though i will admit that i use this game as more of a side activity for instance so far i have been watching the star wars movies while i play it and since you can pause at any time to plan your trains movements i can also watch any movies i have going for however long i want this is a great game to either fill some time or practice your resource management skills as your success relies on your ability to gauge the most efficient use of your time to accomplish your task overall i think this is a pretty great little game though i have a limited amount of hours in game so far you should check it out if you enjoy strategy games and coordination

#####

a train puzzle and logistics game where you try to transport resources around to get manufactured goods to your different cities starts off fun but increasingly becomes more of a pain in the ass puzzle game as it progresses where youre battling against the terrain often times plunking down expensive investments like bridges only to find that your placement is completely useless and now youre out of funds forcing a restart i like the train juggling and the logistics management eventually though battling the terrain became too frustrating for me

#####

great game i get bored of games very quickly and games like farming simulator and this i find myself playing continually ive just completed this and its amazing

#####

great game slightly different art style than train valley 1 but its still cool

#####

really good puzzle game i can say its one of my favorite games i cant seem to put it down 


#####

this is an awesome puzzlegame based on logistics in a railroad theme
really hard to stop playing

#####

did not like it with release because it played so different from train valley 1 after playing the demo of valley world i tried it for a second time an love it right now

#####

love it i loved first game and this one is a bit different and still awesome workshop adds so much and makes the game forever playable

many many hours later i still love this game its amazing and keeps being updated and developers run events and talk with players all the time it has a great community and endless fun thanks to workshop and great people making fun levels

#####

i liked it it was very entertaining
having said that a couple of caveats
  it lacks options the puzzles and way of solving the levels are more or less meant to be one way
  the difficulty or the challenge is in the way you execute it
  some restrictionschallenges are redundant avoiding train crashes is basically the same as to not destroy property when you clean the wreck of a crash it sums a lot in the dont destroy category
  several times your tracks can only have one path and that path is littered with junk you must remove why only one path possible why put an extra cost on the only option i have

overall i enjoyed a lot the first levels but after all those cons i abandoned the game

#####

i found this way better to play than train valley 1 i wanted to like train valley one but ran into control issues i am liking train valley 2

#####

trains are fun puzzles are fun whats not to like i like that most of the levels have multiple ways to solve the puzzles

#####

i love trains so imma be biased but gameplay is so great this is pretty much a strategy and puzzle game and its so fun to play and grind from the different worldslevels all to the achievement chasing there are tons of levels many locomotives to unlock and the graphics are great probably one of my favourite train games that i have played

#####

train valley was a great fun game train valley 2 is so far  early release even better the new gameplay is more fun the challenges are good i am hoping for a lot more tracks this is a game you can play for hours and not even noticing it

#####

train go boom

#####

chugachuga chuga chuga choo choo

fun game way to stingy with how it hands out its stars
however i really just play to see my trains go from one place to another
it makes me relaxed my house is too small to have an actual giant train set  also doubt i would like to spend my money on that
so for a small payment i can have my train set here on the pc nothing but benefits
will continue this one for sure

chugachuga chuga chuga choo choo

#####

i did have a lot of enjoyable time with this game but i stopped playing in frustration towards the end the maps becomes less of an puzzle where you build a smart machine and more squinting at the details hidden by geometry and trying to figure out where the correct path was there is often only one combine that instant fail conditions and you have a game that i feel would be better if it was shorter and more focused than trying to add levels just to have gameplay alternatively do what many free to play games do and allow to skip a level that is frustrating for the time being

#####

great logic puzzle can be challenging on some levels

#####

fun and addictive the puzzles do get harder but going back you can really earn a lot of stars the only downside is that this game would actually do really well with more official levels and ease off it getting harder  the fun is the simple problem solving and repetition which is more relaxing not the really complex or hard levels 
the map builder does however let you make your own levels and can download other user made levels so i think that gets around the issue good fun and well worth a buy

#####

some reviewers are getting hung up on the time goals in this game the pause button is your friend use it this is not a time stress out game its a game about picking what to produce when and how to deliver it in an efficient way cash is very tight usually early so use that pause button ponder your strategy and put your plan into place you can prototype your track builds in pause mode without actually spending any cash im finding that if you come up with a good production and deliver strategy the time goals are very acheiveable and wasting a second here or there is really not a big deal

so dont stress have fun

#####

i played the first train valley quite a bit  i thought it was quite smart and although it had a difficulty curve which sometimes got frustrating i had some fun

tv1 was at its heart a train schedulingpoints switching game  it was a bit twitchy but it also rewarded commonsense planning and could be played off the cuff 

train valley 2 is very different  its a puzzle and a time management game combined  erm  not that well

every level has a build order youll need to figureout as the level unfolds  a layout which will only become obvious as the level progresses and then theres the timemanagement running of that which is basically a watereddown tv1  altogether its just more clutter and less fun

i much preferred tv1s more cavalieropenended approach  even when it got buggy or unfair you got better and better at it wheras every level here is a new learning process

id rather have seen the roughedges and bugs knockedoff tv1 but this is a new and different thing and one i just cannot seem to enjoy

ymmv but this is a big disappointment for me  back to tv1 i guess

#####

i played all the way through the first train valley and loved it this one is definitely a different resourcebased game but i definitely recommend it

#####

simple mechanics that flourish into quite an intricate whole as you progress through each level pretty fun casual yet intensive simulation gameplay

#####

people say that this game gets worse the longer you play it so ill review it now while i still like it playtime 9 hours

im a big fan of mini motorways and for a while ive been looking for a game like that but just slightly more complicated train valley 2 perfectly scratches that itch

i agree with others that as the levels become more difficult the game becomes more tedious  stressful if youre trying to collect all the stars

but so far its a really fun train puzzle game still pretty simple in comparison to other train games

edit yeah the game gets worse the longer you play it i would give it a thumb down now 19 hours

#####

train valley is a thrilling puzzle game that will keep you on the edge of your seat the game challenges you to manage train traffic and build tracks to transport cargo while avoiding collisions the game is so engrossing that i even dreamed about some of the levels that i couldnt beat on my first try ill probably still be telling my grandkids about the two levels that took me hours to beat

the graphics in train valley are welldesigned and add to the games overall charm the puzzles themselves are challenging but not so difficult that they become frustrating the satisfaction of completing a level perfectly is well worth the effort

overall train valley is a game that will keep you hooked for hours on end the combination of addictive gameplay cool graphics and challenging puzzles make it a mustplay for anyone who loves puzzle games

#####

the first one was good this one is better
list
  no anonymous colored goods anymore instead each location produces a specific resource be it human workpower food or building materials
  more strategic goals on each map not just survive a specific amount of time each city demands for an amount of specific goods to be transported there which results in supplying the different locations with those materials needed to create the wanted goods that allows for much more planning ahead of just random trains starting from anywhere
  all of the things i found frustrating in the first one are just gone no money needed to send trains anywhere no monthly costs for your trains no timelimit regarding trains wanting to leave the different locations only you decide when to start trains
  now you are also able to build bridges and tunnels
  there is also a delorean standing on a forgotten track segment 
list
altogether i find this game most relaxing and with the five star rating for each mission 3x time challenge and 2 specific challenges like earning money building specific stuff its still challenging

well done

#####

i think this is a better utilization of the concept than train valley 1  i recommend this game as long as i dont find any game breaking bugs

#####

classic train valley reborn with an excellent sequel with a promise of editor and new game mechanics train valley 2 smashes the fun train based puzzle game fun graphics more complex scenarios than tv1 train valley 1 is very fun and recommend that as well if you dont have it

#####

a straight improvement over the already great first part still train puzzling now with no randomness and more control

#####

let me say this is an early access review and i will keep editing this as time goes by  that being said 

wow  its a different game than tv1  and i will say this tv1 will still be played again and again because i love it so much  

the first one for those that have never played it had stations that were of different colors and as the level progressed more stations would randomly pop  each level never spawned the same stations in the same order every time so it was always varied  the trains had different colors as well and you had to get them to the proper stations each level had three different objectives to meet  i love it becuase there was a level for me that took a month to get perfect and beat playing 35 attempts daily  ive been playing these types of games now since they were on floppy disks not to be confused with todays discs

now back to tv2  this one is more like a simplified transport fever  each station is either a city or a resource generator that requires certain resources and people  you have to look at the level carefully before playing there is not only 2   objectives 1star each other than completing all the stations demands but also a third objective that adds a time managment aspect onto it of gold 3stars silver2stars or bronze1star time objective  this totals 5 stars for the level that you can get  there are 20 levels it is challenging to get all 5 stars and im glad about that 

i like how you can upgrade your trains and buy more as well  ive obviously not finished it but by this time i have mastered with 5 stars the first 4 levels  i wish there were more than 20 levels but i understand you are doing a buildworkshop 

the build part of the game is not yet active im excited for this feature  and for an early access i ran into no bugs at least that i know of i was thoroughly surprised and pleased that i got a 30 off coupon for having tv1 before  what a great way to appreciate those that played your previous game and support you  thank you

room for imporovement

1 im not sure why you guys changed the control behavior but i wish you had not  i mean for example build mode r seems to time out after a bit and doesnt stay

2 the graphics honestly suck ass and are very disappointing but i understand that it is early access  im just putting it on my list of things i dont like i hope you dont rely on a workshop to make your game better in this way that would be lame

i hope this helps and i will continue to keep updating this

#####

a really nice twist on the initial concept of train valley  adding a resource management layer makes you think a little differently while still keeping the same fun of the first one

#####

i loved the simple yet complex puzzlemanagement game that was train valley this sequel is already appearing to top the predecessor by a new variety of level styles and different resources to manage i cant recommend such a cheap and fun game enough the music is also extremely relaxing

#####

this is an early access title and i still have almost nothing negative to say about it its straightforward time and resource management simple clean yet challenging fans of the original will enjoy the increased measure of control while newcomers can appreciate a train valley game without the sometimes frustrating random element of the original

quite literally the only downside to it in its present state i am playing on day1 early access is the graphics style  its using very low poly models which could stand to be improved 

i thouroughly look forward to seeing how the title develops between now and release

#####

this is a fantastic game i love the way it keeps good concepts from the original and adds some more economic detail  graphics are surprisingly nice although i was skeptical of the style  the levels feel a bit unbalanced i struggled getting 5 stars at one of the earliest levels then blazed through the next couple or so  theres some annoyance with track building and the hotkeys are strange but customizable but overall its a great early access game and fairly priced as well

#####

thought i was getting a simple and relaxing tycoon kind of game but it is 90 puzzle so you have to follow the rules and build the game wants you to build and give little to none freedom also it isnt relaxing cause you have to beat a certain time to get more stars for each map i was about 50 done when the frst timer went out on map 2 so you cant chill and build

bmy review to train valley 2b

train valley 2 is a very difficutly train tycoon puzzle game take your railroad company from the days of the industrial revolution and into the future meeting the needs of the valleys cities and industries build railroad networks manage traffic upgrade your locomotives and keep everything on schedule without delays or accidents so far so good but after level 25 is this game is very frustating if you will try to get all 5 stars also quickly becomes monotonous and boring that i find very unfortunate there are no checkpoints or a undo button i have no problem with challenges but with the previous things mentioned this game is no fun for all 93 achievements you need 4 dlcs passenger flow myth and rails editors bulletin the pandeia project

buproub
 very difficult
 93 steamachievements you need all 4 dlcs passenger flow myth and rails editors bulletin the pandeia project

bucontraub
 the track switch is a little bit complicate
 no checkpoints or a undo button 
 some of the levels are very monotonous and boring in length
 unclear instruction what to do
 very frustrating gameplay
 no helpful tutorial

h1i do not recommend this gameh1

#####

disappointing sequel plays nothing like the first game and lacks the feeling of satisfaction from cleverly connecting stations resource management isnt fun so dont buy if you expect something like tv1 its not a bad game but its not what you might be expecting

overview
very simple and efficient time burner with engaging and applying logic and critical thinking if to say so

it is good for any age group but depends on the taste kids should love this

tutorial is awful but knowing the gameplay tips and tricks might loose audience due to extreme simplicity xd
 to beat the timer is required to master the pause button
 to save tiles place the route in between and make use of triangle junctions

received as a bonus game for the humble choice bundle of april 2020

i never write reviews but i just had to because i love everything about this game you can play it casually take your time and allow yourself some mistakes if you dont care about the score or you can try to get 5 stars on each level which can get quite challenging in some cases as far as im aware the only thing youll be missing out on if you dont get all stars is some locomotive skins but thats just enough motivation for me to try to get those 5 stars even though i usually couldnt give less of a crap about scoring systems the requirements for five stars differ per level although they arent unique for each one mostly about completion time but the timer doesnt run when you press pause  the other two stars differ per level as i said 

each level presents unique challenges and feels fresh even after having played quite some this is mostly because of landscape and positioning but also some levels have a unique gameplay mechanic all of that makes it so you cant just maintain one strategy for every level but instead have to think about the right strategy to overcome every new challenge laid before you

i have just reached the final age and i would be sad that ive almost played all levels except theres a pretty large library of workshop levels made by players which are also a lot of fun to play 

the graphics are simple but good and i thought the sound effects would get annoying after 36 hours into gameplay but i still like them
i will definitely be checking out the dlc as well

i dream of railways now
1010

edit when i first wrote this review i had played this game for 36 hours one and a half year later i have sunk over 700 hours into this game still love it as before

#####

good fun great style challenging  try for perfect game

#####

you can drain a pond to reach a machine shop and have tesla trying to kill you with lightning storms

id say it was worth the money

#####

i prefer the first one where im just laying tracks and moving trains tv2 has a puzzle aspect that is quite a grind and loses the free flowing nature of tv1 if youre looking for a puzzle game there are a lot more engaging ones out there

#####

best logickal game for the logic thinkers for the bigger smart
