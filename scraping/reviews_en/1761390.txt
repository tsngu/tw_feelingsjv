my autistic ass played this for 7 hours straight today

#####

i am a disappointment to my parents

#####

hatsune miku may not be able to fix my broken family and get my wife back but at least i can give her cat ears

#####

the world is a cruel and unjust place
sega finally releases project diva for pc
ah miku

#####

she is inside of my computer let her out now

#####

















#####

if hatsune miku has a million number of fans i am one of them if hatsune miku has ten fans i am one of them if hatsune miku has only one fan then that is me if hatsune miku has no fans that means i am no more on the earth if the world is against hatsune miku i am against the world i love #hatsunemiku till my last breath die hard fan of hatsune miku

#####

most of the reviews are terrible meme reviews or written for people already entrenched in the fandom so here is an actual one for those that need it

hatsune miku project mega mix is the latest in a series of rhythm games by sega and crypton future media which uses vocaloid music created by variety of different people if you arent familiar with vocaloid music it is music that uses the vocaloid vocal synthesizer in the hatsune miku games the music spans the range of japanese popular music but most often falls in the range of what one would expect from an idol group

while there is a series you dont need to worry about purchasing previous games as there isnt really a story well nothing you will be spoiled of in this game and including the dlc this game has around 250 tracks which includes basically every track in every previous game so this is the definitive one to get as of the end of 2022

speaking of the dlc if this is something that is up your alley you might as well purchase the vip edition since otherwise purchasing the dlc will cost about as much as the game itself

as mentioned there are about 250 tracks with the dlc with multiple 5 difficulties easy normal hard extreme and extra extreme every song has a hard and extreme almost all have a normal difficulty most have an easy difficulty and a little under half have an extra extreme difficulty the rhythm gameplay consists of timing button presses of the 6 primary buttons and their combinations in time when the button moves over to the corresponding button press while the background plays a music video the actual video part is sometimes distracting and people have different opinions about whether this is part of the fun or an annoyance if you wish to see the video alone without the gameplay you can also do that

overall i recommend this for people who like rhythm games and jpop though there are some headaches that could be avoided with better menu design including things i clarify below 

some things that arent clear that will make your life easier
1 the options menu only has a few things in it mainly the primary videoaudio settings but the customize area actually has some submenus with more options like key configuration and setting the timing to match your audiovideo delay it only goes up to 150 ms which may not be enough for wireless headsets but you can also adjust extra delay for each song by pausing an adjusting individually
2 you can go to practice mode or music video mode by selecting a song and then going leftright before selecting start
3 you can configure the outfit for each song by pressing x when the song is highlighted and then configuring there if you want to go to the recommended one you hit left and right trigger at the same time if you dont change any outfits youll always have the default ones and not the recommended ones

#####

if hatsune miku has a million fans then i am one of them
if hatsune miku has ten fans then i am one of them
if hatsune miku has only one fan then that is me
if hatsune miku has no fans then that means i am no longer on earth
if the world is against hatsune miku then i am against the world

#####

my mother walked into my room while i was playing this game and i will never forget the subtle yet profound look of disappointment on her face
1010 would recommend

#####

im thinkin miku miku oooo ueeeee eooooo

#####

hi

im not here to tell you if this game is good or not but just letting the other few sous with decks know the game boots and works with no apparent issues

now if youll excuse me i have charts to fail and work to ignore

#####



















#####

give me f 2nd cowards

#####

hatun mik

#####

pros
 once your pizza is delivered have some fun with miku

cons
 does not feature scott president of dominos pizza

#####

hatsune miku has taken over my life i used to be a huge metalhead i would play heavy metal on spotify when doing anything now i dont even use spotify yet alone listen to such music hatsune miku has not only singlehandedly destroyed my yearslong metal phase she has also changed my life truly a lifechanging experience i recommend forfeiting all mortal possessions and thoughts to miku you will be happier person once miku becomes your life

#####

i wish miku was real

#####

finally i dont need to resort to modding and piracy to play the game thank you sega i love you

#####

so far solid pc port seems to be using independent flip composition in borderless mode which is great one small issue i can point out is that the game lacks a framerate cap option that supports 30fps for lowend systems or high refresh rates for highend systems or anyone without a freesync monitor it works fine on the steam deck as well it already blows the arcade release running unofficially out of the water please let them know about any issues youre having and please support this release

the fact you can pick future tone visuals instead of megamix is already worth the price of admission

its been 3000 years but we finally have project diva on pc

edit there are some really nasty audio pauses that happen at times alongside audio desyncing afterwards patch those issues and have a proper fps uncap option and this port will be solid

edit 2 make sure to have your audio sample rate in windows set to 16bit 48khz that fixes most of the desyncing issues for me pairing that with special k and a framerate uncap patch to get the latency as low as possible is what id advise doing any minute now until the steam moderators community ban me for this review because i dared to mention a mod that genuinely helps out with a bunch of bad pc game releases as of late

#####

bro its hatsune miku

#####

when you were partying bi studied the mikub

when you were having premarital sex bi mastered the buttonsb

while you wasted your days at the gym in pursuit of vanity bi cultivated many cute outfitsb

and now that the world is on fire and the sound voltex players are at the gate you have the audacity to come to me for help

#####

game itself is fantastic denuvo is not the game experiences frequent lag and stuttering problems which is absolutely 100 not acceptable in a rhythm game downvoting so sega understands that this is gamebreaking and needs immediate attention

#####

thank you jerma for making me buy this

#####

i wish she was real so i could have a friend

#####

miku slapped me across the face when i missed a note she curb stomped me when i didnt perfect a song and she starved me when i couldnt play popipo 39 times in a row thank you miku

#####

my wife left me but hastune miku will stay with me forever 

#####

miku

#####

great way to disappoint your parents

#####

played as joke now have hatsune miku addiction 1010

#####

i will never get my 60 back

#####

i am listening to matsume hiku of course i am mentally stable

#####

finally miku on pc now the playstation is completely useless

#####

popipopipo popi po

#####

it has miku and her gay little dances

#####

who is miku for the blind she is vision for the hungry she is the chef for the thirsty she is water if miku thinks i agree if miku speaks im listening if miku has a million fans i am one of them if miku has ten fans i am one of them if miku has only one fan that is me if miku has no fans i no longer exist if the whole world is against miku i am against the whole world i will love miku until my very last breath

#####

i am a 52 year old father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is now 18 my son recently downloaded hatsune miku project diva mega mix and in less than a week he had already played for over 20 hours this was terrible for me as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on tiktok so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game did the tutorial but i was stuck on what you were supposed to do i asked my son for help and he recommended me a song to play i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought my son and i closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories

#####

immediately after purchasing hatsune miku herself broke down the door to my home and kissed me on the moutgh

#####

h1rinchan now  rinchan now

rinchan rinchan rinchan nowh1

#####

pros

has hatsune miku

cons 



#####

miku miku oo wee oo

#####

jerma made me buy this

#####

this is the best game ive ever played it cured my depression and saved my family from poverty i dont have anyone else to thank but hatsune miku 3

#####

i think the world would be a better place if it belonged to miku

#####

byes finally we have an official hatsune miku project diva game on pcb

since im a rythym game and also anime fan i immediately fell in love with this game i only played with the psp titles in ppsspp with a playstation 4 controller and that was easy compared to this one this one is harder and more complicated which i dont really mind i love challenges you know since i never had a playstation 3 or 4 so ive never played the other games in the series so im just literally experiencing the whole game how it works etc this is going to be an interesting and a very long ride _

i saw a few people complaining about the performance because of denuvo and honestly i did not experienced any of that im rocking a really old pc i73770  16gb ddr3  r9 nano and it holds a stable 60fps at max settings no input lag nothing so i dont really have any issues so far and i hope that this does not change in the future

if youre as crazy as i am youll buy the vip edition instead of the base game

iside note this is the first time that ive ever spent 5999 on a single gamei

#####

i like hitting the buttons when the game tells me to hit the buttons and being graded on it

#####

i dont feel so good why are all my limbs slack why cant i move my eyes why cant i move my mouth is this an eternal dialogue i cant see the end of the horizon hatsune miku

#####

im a 23 year old man and this game just changed my life for ever when my dad saw my monitor i had to silence him

rest in peace dad

h1 remove denuvo h1
denuvo is a practice the game industry needs to drop always online is a practice the game industry needs to stop

get the nintendo switch port instead you can actually play that one without an internet connection stuttering freezes crashes or input issues

#####

yes i do listen to vocaloid how could you tell



























#####

im thinking miku miku oooweeeooo

many years ago i was browsing the psn on my ps3 and saw a rhythm game demo with some anime girl in it  i liked guitar hero and elite beat agents so why not try this  

at first im like what is the high pitched squeaky weeb nonsense  but after replaying the same demo all night long i realized i had to hit the buy button on amazon for my first copy of project diva f  

that started a many year affair with ps3 psp psvita ps4 and switch games soundtracks figures concerts and a trip to hokkaido even  

now finally project diva lands on pc spoiler officially spoiler

the game is capped at 60 fps but i have no issues playing in windowed borderless mode at 1440p on my i7 6700k rtx 2080 build  nothing seems out of line plenty of settings similar to the console releases with a few graphics options sprinkled in  i do not see this as a demanding title performancewise

i am using a wireless xbox one pad and have no issues so far  i am not very good at these games but find no glaring latency issues but ymmv 

i strongly recommend the vip version since it has the most content of any of the releases perhaps save future tone at release for 60  if youre going to go in go big  just realize that the item unlock key is included  for returning fans of the series who want to skip straight to extra hard theyre likely to download this  but for new players who want some progression i recommend disabling it in the games properties within your library such that you can work you way up the difficulties while unlocking outfits 

just one hour in i strongly recommend this game  but be cautious as you might delve down a dark rabbit hole and find yourself buying led glow sticks and nendoroids

i am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single farther to my son who is 14 now my son got this game for christmas in 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game picked a song and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he taught me how to play i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories

i got this game as a gift from my dad

#####

ah i dont feel so good
why are all my limbs slack
why cant i move my eyes
why cant i move my mouth 
is this an internal dialogue
i cant see the end of the horizon
hatsune miku is that you

#####

im thinking miku miku ooo eee ooo

#####

the prequel to dominos app feat hatsune miku finally comes to pc

#####

miku saved my life

#####

important edit update 101 does nothing to fix the random lag spikes that occur during songs so my review will stay as a negative for now
come on sega get it together


i hate that i have to write a negative review but i have to voice my frustration

my pc is well beyond the specs needed to play a game like this my pc has no trouble running witcher 3 at near max settings but this game stutters and lags on nearly every single song to the point where sometimes it causes me to completely fail that song due to the fact the game freezes and makes it so i cant input anything for up to 3 seconds

i have a feeling the culprit is denuvo so until the time the game is patched to fix this issue or even if some saint mods the game to fix this issue i have to give this release a negative review

the game is fantastic dont get me wrong i have been playing project diva since the ps3 era and it is a top tier rhythm game so i really hope sega fixes this

edit after playing for a bit more i have noticed that the lag spikes also occur in the menus themselves and not just during gameplay also the lags i experience in the menus last seemingly the same amount of time and occur at the same regularity as the lags during gameplay

edit 2 seemingly putting my pc into airplane mode removes the lag spikes completely i was able to play issue free for about 2 hours

due to the use of denuvo mega mix has mild stuttering mid song about 1 single second 23 times per song if the game was another genre it would be bearable however this is a rhythm game every second counts and theres no way to get perfect chains or clear hard difficulty songs due to this the workaround of disconnecting the internet can cause scoreprogress loss or sometimes not work fully so i guess maybe ill just get this on the switch instead

why no jerma dlc

#####

kids always get sad knowing that santa doesnt exist but for me it was hatsune miku

#####

my autism really came out when my fingers touched the keyboard it was so good in the middle of playing nyanyanyanyanyan i started crying tears of joy if i could play it 247 i would but unfortunately i need eat stupid food and take care of my dying father overall good game play if have autistic um cuz this brang happy 2 me  game went fast me like me like nothing about gamr

i wish reviews were based on star ratings or a 110 scale rather than recommendednot recommended because it forces you to frame games as being excellent or trash and makes it difficult to grab readers attention when discussing pros and cons id rate this 710 ive played for 250 hours nowand own all of the dlc so i obviously dont hate this game i do however have a massive bone to pick with the devs for not addressing what is evidently a widespread and aggravating issue so im going to start with that  

my issues

1 the stutter i have tried every solution put forward by the community on steam as well as solutions suggested on other forums to absolutely no avail theres minor consistent stutter throughout most tracks and then theres the gamebreaking stutter i can get halfway through a track and the audiovisuals will suddenly slow to a near stop only to jump back up to speed seconds later even if you know the oncoming button combinations and try to push through it wont matter  the stutter also seems to cause the game to fail to register any input whatsoever and given the nature of a rhythm game this often breaks your score ive noticed it happens approximately every 1015 minutes and for clarity this is occurring on a laptop exclusively designed and catered to gaming that runs aaa games on high graphics with 0 issues with no other software running in the background during these instances in other words my device specs and my settings are not likely components in this issue

ive come to the same conclusion many others have and that would be that denuvo the anticheat system is likely responsible denuvo has been implicated in poor game performance for a variety of games from what ive read online and stuttering in games has repeatedly been attributed to it ive been patiently playing through the stuttering issue for months but after having encountered it 4 times in an hour practicing objectively difficult and fast tracks tweaking computer settings to no avail and just generally ending up frustrated instead of relaxing as intended i no longer have the patience for it it becomes less fun and more upsetting when youre about to score a perfect on say bring it on just for it to stutter at a crucial buttonspamming moment 

2 this game isnt disabilityfriendly

i know this aspect is irrelevant to many folks so scroll past to the pros of the game if this isnt relevant to you as someone with a genetic disorder resulting arthritis and audiovisual processing disorders there are accessibility settings regarding everything from fontcolorsymbolsthe actual gameplay some of which double as challenge settings they could offer that are seemingly unavailablewerent considered additionally not all tracks were balanced properly ex mikus voice may come off muted compared to the music or the reverse in some tracks which makes interpreting the track difficult you can injure tendons playing certain tracks looking at you jigsaw puzzle and the button icons on the screen blend into numerous track backgrounds meaning learning the tracks the first time around with any kind of visual impairment is tedious 

at this point ive achieved dozens of perfect scores on tracks like teo gaikotsu gakudan no riria etc on hardextremeex extreme so please dont write this off as get good because im not terrible at rhythm games lol im just pointing out that not everyone plays these competitively and i had to work twice as hard to pass tracks im sure ablebodied players had significantly less trouble with for me the enjoyment is mostly in being able to move my body in a generally safe way in sync to good music if atlus persona dancing series was capable of adding more than 2 dozen modifiers for added accessibility or conversely challenge sega was more than capable of giving such settings consideration when porting this game if their concern was that it would unbalance the playing field they could have factored in negative score modifiers based on the used settings or disabled achievementspresentation on leaderboards



anyway ive gotten my whining out of the way now for

things i like

1 the track selection is honestly quite decent 

games like this sometimes get bloated by subpar music that makes you avoid playing through the tracks  there are certainly a few songs im not a fan of but its not offputting my favorites list is up to 100 songs and this game has encouraged me to purchase several tracksalbums online to listen to im obsessed with reol and wowakas work ill also add that some tracks actually have been retunedclarified from their original releases and were generally more pleasant to listen to 

2 an excellently commitmentfree pastime that offers increasing degrees of challenge a neverending source of entertainment

some rhythm games force you to play through poorly written story modes or minigames in order to unlock tracks difficulty settings or costumes as opposed to just letting you jump into the actual rhythm game it makes you feel like youre working just to play the game for the main purpose you bought it for project diva mega mix doesnt torture you that way you jump right into it following the tutorial and you can walk away from it and come back to it without feeling like youre doing chores in order to enjoy it 

missing accessibility settings aside the first 2 difficulty settings are laughably chill the jump to hard is where they introduce the majority of the button combinations and extreme is where it starts forcing you to mash and alternate between those combinations constantly i personally love the challenge because you can tangibly track your progression as you go from surely thats not possible to ayyy i just did that somehow how do i have fingers still see how it feels to progress on sadistic music factory so whenever i start a new track and encounter a ridiculous wave of combinations i spend unhealthy amounts of time learning them its just pure fun and very satisfying

3 the modules are creative and generally fun to toy around with 

ah yes kaito in a jumpsuit with a tail demonic horns and sunglasses this makes perfect sense while dancing to a love song the pinnacle of gaming truly 

if you cant laugh at the ridiculous things the vocaloids are dancing in whats the point 



tldr 
notorious stutter issue that impacts performance somewhat overwhelms the otherwise decent quality of this game and it has not been addressed formally accessibility features are largely missing and button mapping is somewhat annoying however the available tracks are enjoyable the game doesnt leverage tracks by forcing you to play through a story mode or otherwise do things that arent strictly rhythmgameplay and the range of difficulty settings makes it perfect for people who enjoy continuous challenges

while the adjustments to the game itself switching between mega mix and future tone visual styles etc are worth the price of admission out of the box the game is borderline unplayable my pc is way beyond the recommended requirements but even in mega mix mode there are bizarre stutters and lag that are utterly unacceptable in a rhythm game i spent more than half of the time i was playing messing around with the visual settings hoping to fix the issue but even at the lowest it doesnt make a difference 

for example 39 musics pv lags severely at any setting but only during the shots that are zoomed in on miku 2d dream fever lags slightly throughout the entire song good luck even attempting to play senbonzakura because the lag is so severe its just unplayable its maybe not as noticeable on lower difficulties but playing hard or extreme charts is almost impossible

its frustrating because project diva being on pc is monumental but if its unplayable whats the point

edit due to fixes implemented in special k the game stutters and lag are gone for me im leaving the rating the same because until sega fixes the issues themselves i cant recommend buying this unless youre willing to use another piece of software to run it the lagging stems from segas frame limiter being incorrectly implemented and the stutters are due to the network code im not going to recommend anyone buy a bad port because unfortunately thats what this is right now

#####

remove denuvo its impacting the game heavily and made some songs unplayable my laptop can handle aft just fine with no drop in fps whatsoever

#####

hatsune miku

#####

yet again sega makes me paid a game ive already have

#####

the game is great but the port is not whoever put denuvo in a rhythm game is a fucking moron

#####

i used to have a crush on len when i was 11
now i am wayyyyyyyy older than him now wtf

#####





















#####

thoroughly disappointed to find out that hatsune miku does not in fact say sega when you open the game as suggested by the trailer other than that it is a fun rhythm game

#####

do not be afraid of ex extreme it can sense fear

okay serious part now
take denuvo off your fucking game you are a multibillion dollar company you dont actually care if you have people pirate your game you just hate consumers denuvo adds bloatware and causes the game to stutter i have a 3090 ti graphics card and the game still fucking stutters that is not acceptable in a damn rhythm game

denuvo stuttering legit ruins this game youre better off finding a way to get pdaft

update if you really want to buy this game i recommend installing diva mod manager to get rid of denuvo and other qol improvements of your choosing amazing game but sega sucks

#####

hatsune miku is real and she is your friend

#####

i can watch sonic the hedgehog and peter griffin dance to skeleton orchestra and lillia

tldr for a rhythm game that demands precision i have faced unacceptable stuttering issues that are not present on ps4 and nintendo switch editions of this game possibly due to denuvo drm additionally the game is locked to 60fps i would still suggest giving the game a try just remember to stay under 2 hours in case you need a refund because if the stuttering issues are not present for you project diva is a fantastic game

as a huge fan of vocaloid and the project diva series this title is a huge disappointment due to its technical issues
when playing a game as precise as project diva even the most momentary of stutters can ruin a run in my experience the stuttering of this game is unacceptable considering that the same or nearly the same game runs flawlessly on ps4 and even nintendo switch hardware

lets talk about the good for just a moment project diva is an absolutely wonderful game to play it is accessible to a wide variety of players and offers immense challenge for those who seek out higher difficulty levels i strongly suggest trying the game for yourself and seeing whether or not the stuttering affects you because if it doesnt youre in for a treat
but as a midhighlevel player the stuttering issues make the game entirely unplayable and absolutely demanded a refund 

and its not due to hardware limitations according to task manager i am not even utilizing 30 of my cpu gpu or ram and i should hope im not considering this game exists on nintendo switch and i am playing with a ryzen 7 5800h rtx 3050 ti mobile variant and a whole 32gb of ddr4 ram even on the lowest graphics settings these issues exist and even on a good run with no large stutters the experience is simply nowhere near as smooth as it is on playstation or switch

why its impossible to be sure however two facts are known first this game uses denuvo drm secondly denuvo drm is known among the gaming community to cause massive performance issues to games all across the industry i wont say for certain that its the cause of the problem but you do the math

to top it all off the game appears to be locked to 60 frames per second yes a pc rhythm game where every frame genuinely does count is unable to run faster than 60fps unacceptable

in summary dammit sega i was so excited for a pc port of project diva i snatched it up as soon as it went on sale but the bigger the fan the bigger the disappointment guess ill be sticking to console for now

#####

i hate my wife

#####

kaito in a cat suit

#####

excellent game series absolutely one of the best rhythm games available today

however theres one major flaw with this port and thats the use of denuvo the first night i played this game it was fine and i experienced no lagging every time ive tried to play after that the songs randomly stutter in the middle and go off sync sometimes the game goes so off sync that its close to a second off its absolutely impossible to play this game in its current state due to denuvo causing lag and stuttering issues i am not eligible to return this game anymore but if i was i would absolutely return it because as i said above its impossible to play

#####

i love hatsune miku

im close to 250 hrs playing project diva across pc and my ps4 and i still suck 3

#####

how did hatsune miku herself find my home address 

#####

this game took over my life for a minute not a big fan cant get the time back if i ever cross the 100 hour mark im sorry ive relapsed

#####

for anyone new to the project diva series this game is not a new original entry its more like a big compilation this game is pretty much just a pc port of project diva mega mix on the nintendo switch which itself was also just a port of project diva arcadefuture tone with a toon shader attached aside for some very few exceptions dont expect to see new songs mvs or modules that you havent seen in the previous games so know what youre buying with this

gameplay wise this game plays like the arcade game it has a very steep learning curve and nearly impossible to beat on high difficulties if you dont learn to assign button combinations early while i think the series gameplay peaked during the ps3 games era this type gameplay is still very fun once you get used to it the high skill ceiling also adds more play hours i guess some song charts are better than others but none of them i found to be bad fortunately i didnt encounter any stuttering or lag in my 100 hours of playing

the main selling point this game has is the extensive song list and the option to turn the toon shader off no offense to anyone who likes it but its just too bright and undetailed for my liking but for some reason not every song has the option to turn it off and even worse sometimes it seems like the song is playable without the shader on but then midway it turns back on for some segments like in the song suki kirai its really annoying and i dont see the reason on why they couldnt just turn it off for every song other than pure lazyness

its also important to note that this game doesnt specify in the menu that some mvs are made by fans using edit mode in the early games thats not a bad thing but it must looks somewhat jarring to new players that some videos have the characters do janky movements with stiff camera angles due to limitations the creators had using edit mode although some mvs arent even animated in game just playing the music video taken from the original song again lazy lazy sega

so basically if youre looking for a new fresh next gen project diva entry this aint it but if you just want the convenience of being able to play a massive if you get the vip edition library of vocaloid songs with pretty challenging gameplay i do recommend this game so long as you can look past its inconsistencies

#####

miku

#####

project diva is one of its kind sad thing that sega probably will never develop any new sequels anymore development team said to be disbanded years ago this steam version is also just another port like the one on switch and many others

despite the stutter problem which is said to be a result of the denuvo antipiracy program this version of project diva is still very enjoyable it got highresolution highrefresh rate mod needed and dozens of costumes id say its a good nostalgic and relaxing rhythm game

for where and how to download mods check out the guides eg urlhttpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2857944183 fix the game and other mods url

for those who are new to project diva or rhythm games just keep practicing with your controller 
if youre just to chill watch some music videos or unlock the steam achievements play with whatever keysettings and gestures you like as a reference i got all the achievements after 100 hours and i havent played this game since like 10 years ago 

but if your goal is to get perfect on high difficulty songs look for some guides b4 practicing will save you a lot of effort me as another reference have to practice all over again for those level8 and higher difficulty songs with my left hand and the 4 trigger buttons almost 100 hour wasted

h3 wish everyone can perfect all the songs h3

1010 would break my thumb again for the almighty hatsune miku

#####

please remove denuvo

#####



























#####

i love hatsune miku yippee thumbs_up

#####

runs with no problems on the steam deck but cant say the same for the desktop experience please remove denuvo and take a look at what is causing the stuttering on pc please thank you

#####

i have never felt the touch of a woman

#####

this game is absolutely the definitive project diva experience as long as you mod it mods are super easy to install and theres plenty of cool custom modules and songs you can add into the game along with simple pleasures like making miku sing sega when you open the game again this one is important the game runs well on most hardware but it can have annoying lag spikes at times which is horrible to have in a rhythm game and is generally accessible with and without controller personally i really miss when this series was consistently active with new entries it makes me sad sega puts all their marbles into project sekai when that just doesnt entice me the same way project diva has i think this game has a lot of potential especially if they added an edit mode with steam workshop accessibility but we all know its a pipe dream as project diva is dead outside of rereleasing the same game every few years on different hardware which is saddening to see overall though i genuinely recommend this game to anyone who likes rhythm games and or hatsune mikuvocaloid it has sunken more hours from my life then steam can ever show since ive been playing these games for over a decade now all the way back to the very first one on psp i utterly love this series and i can only pray they decide to show it more love in the future

#####

before playing this game  i was a normal person who love life and people around me always be that one guy who help out other people in need but after playing this game and get to know miku  i became a racist  a homophobic  a weeb a degenerate  a warcrime crimnal  a alcoholicthen i proceed to join miku on her adventure to the middle east where i would unconsciously murdering innocent and gunning down people who i promised i gonna let them freeeverything is fine she said as i continue gunning down unarmed civilian she showed me a innocent smile while womans and kids screaming begging for helpi was too busy drowning in her beautiful smile as long as it make her happy  i would also be happy 
i love miku
miku is love
miku is life

#####

i played this game at the arcade and a small crowd formed so awesome so epic i cant wait to be put on youtube

#####

i like kaito he is my little wittle pookie bear little shmookins little baby booper bompkin dompkin dunkin donuts

#####

its a constant struggle trying to watch hatsune miku do her gay little dances and hit the notes at the same time simply rhythm game perfection

#####

its a pc port of a switch port of an arcade remaster of an already existing arcade release and you already know youre gonna buy it again plus it has tons of modding potential from the wonderful vocaloid community if youre broke however i would only recommend picking it up when it goes on sale

#####

my favourite all time game because no matter what im never bored of it theres about 150 songs without dlc and 256 with i believe so even without your well entertained not to mention the outfits are pretty endless so if you like to design your own for the songs you have a wide selection to keep you busy along with a strong challenge with difficulties ranging 110 easiest being easy normal hard extreme ex extreme which that last one is basically extra extreme mode in case it wasnt already hard enough the graphics are great game runs perfectly for me and for sure lives up to its reviews and both price

#####

she will mikumiku you

#####

started to warm up to this version of miku despite all the cutbacks from future tone but denuvo causes random stutters no matter what which is especially egregious for a rhythm game 

maybe when sega finally removes that shit itll be playable but probably should skip it for now unless you make good use of that steam refund policy

#####

we finally got a project diva game on steam and its excellent

great price for the amount of songs you get especially if you are familiar with the prices future tone on ps4 andor mega mix on switch with their respective dlcs vip edition is a steal
this game is absolutely gorgeous whether you use the future tone visuals or mega mix its just stunning to look at
the rhythm game itself can be very challenging and unforgiving on the harder difficulties which is definitely something i enjoy and the normal difficulty is still very fun despite having a more casual experience when you do well in this game you really feel accomplished because the accuracy rating is fairly strict if you want those perfect scores
also this game is also very easy to mod do what you will with that information

side note
ive seen a few people report desynclagstuttering issues often claimed to be caused by denuvo but im currently gaming on a laptop and i play this game with max graphics in both future tone and mega mix modes and after several hours of actually playing and not just watching the music videos i havent had a single problem with lag or anything ive played on every difficulty so its not like the charts arent intense enough to cause the issues that others have
hopefully the devs fix that issue for those people dealing with it asap


ps i wish they would add back the 4 songs that were cut from this version of the game white dove nekomimi archive ievan polkka saturation im not sure who thought it was a good idea to remove ievan polkka since it feels pretty iconic to the game given that every tutorial in the series seems to use it

#####

hatsune miku kicked me in the jaw and choked me but i got 100 on three songs so far lets see if i can keep it up so she doesnt keep me in the basement

#####

ive always been a huge fan of the project diva series since f 2nd first came out on the ps3 in 2014 and ive played future tone the original console version of the arcade game since it came out i was surprised but excited to see that the game had been suddenly ported to pc and got it once i got the opportunity so it really hurts to say that i cannot recommend the game on pc in the state it is in now

the game for many people including me will stutter freeze and desync randomly and nothing has been done to actually fix this since it is caused by denuvo the unnecessary antitamper sega almost never removes from their pc releases on top of that the game has issues that can make the game permanently delete all of your save data or not be able to launch at all unless you want to reinstall it and lose your save data or somehow even cause broken audio for razer headphones

its incredibly heartbreaking to see so little care put into porting a series i love i still am holding out hope to see these issues be resolved but until then if you really want to try this game out go for the playstation version of the game future tone if you can instead that versions content is divided into more costly dlc compared to this version but it does have almost all of the same content and far fewer issues compared to this version

has kagamine len

#####

this games a great antidepressant once you are good enough to clear a song in normal mode
its also very accessible in my opinion and it even allows for cheat shortcuts that can be used to aid with multiple button inputs
the game can be played with one hand on the easiest difficulty setting if you adjust the slidercontrols to fit so if you happen to have a child  adult friend that is critically handicapped in some way or lost an arm you might attempt to quickly adjust the settings in a way that still allows them to have fun
luckily i am not in such a position myself but i still like to mention accesibility features that exist in a game since theres gonna be people out there who might actually be desperate to find games that are accessible

#####

after 3399 hours i must say this is a very miku game just a miku moment its miku very miku
also kagamine len my precious
10010

#####

temporarily i will give this game a do not recommend tag because after trying out just 3 songs there is constant stuttering on every stage running a ryzen 5950 and geforce 3090 causing inputs to completely miss which cannot happen in a rhythm game

very fun games that i also own on ps4switch but sega needs to patch up some of the stuttering issues to give this game the positive feedback it deserves

edit

game works fine now  looks like the issues are gone and on all my pc the game works great now  at this point game is a high recommendation

#####

remove denuvo the stuttering is so damn annoying  bring back the diva rooms

#####

i only got this game to see kaito in a cat costume worth it

#####

i see miku i buy

#####

rin kagamine my beloved

#####

i already own mega mix and future tone and all their dlc but maybe throwing money at this admittedly pretty solid port will make sega give us a new pd game thats not just future tone for the 4th time i mean it probably wont happen but lmao can you imagine

#####

hoping jermas stream convinced more people to buy this game and try it out has been one of my favorite game series for a while i am glad its on steam get this game

i have seen people saying their game lags and stutters and two people said they have a ryzen cpu this could be the issue so if you have a ryzen make sure you are educated on how to place a refund request through steam

#####

probably the first game to come to mind when you think of a playable drug trip is it a good one absolutely am i good at it no but for some reason its still fun

#####

jerma thank you for showing me how awesome this game is and convincing me to buy it never played a hatsune miku game until now i love me some rhythm games so this game was right up my alley and it was worth every penny

#####

i shun akiyama of the yakuza 4 approve of this game

#####

im thinking miku miku oo ee oo

#####

i havent even booted it up once but my girlfriend gave it to me and i love her so its a good game

#####

ill miku miku you for reals

#####

miku miku ooeeoo

if you only really listen to vocaloid and happen to be mentally ill like me then this game is perfect for you
im going to continue playing now byee

#####

this game is very game makes my brain happy every time 
nice


#####

i would love to wholeheartedly love to recommend this as i adore the project diva series and have dumped many many hours in to playing every entry and its what made me realize that i enjoy rhythm games in general but i cant the performance stutters from the denuvo drm that sega chose to implement in this game kill the enjoyment whenever they occur and there seems to be no way to predict them ive documented some of them myself via streaming and recording the game but even just playing on my own even after closing background applications tweaking settings and trying two separate pcs with different hardware configs i cant get it to perform consistently i bought this game in the hopes of making it easier to record and stream but honestly i was probably better off using my capture card for the ps4 version because that at least runs consistently having a perfect attempt at a song only to have it stutter and desync just doesnt make me want to play if sega can remove the drm id advise giving it a shot but in the current state the game is in id recommend you pick up future tonefuture soundcolorful tone on the ps4ps5 or the original mega mix on the switch if those platforms are available to you

#####

其实看到大家说不值犹豫了蛮久才买但当我拿起deck玩的一刻好像回到了在高中课间捧着psp偷偷摸摸打歌姬计划的时光那时候没有这么多曲子也没有这么多自定义的衣服更没有这些亚种的角色弱音重音亚北曾经幼稚的我把她们的头像花在课本上打开这个游戏有一种圆梦的感觉也许我没有成为世俗意义上成功的大人但我已经过上了曾经的自己我憧憬的生活

#####

i played hatsune on every platform it was ever released but nothing beats playing it on the steam deck its just a perfect collection with 251 songs playing songs on extreme there is a small stutter sometimes during a song making it go out of sync hopefully that will be fixed

#####

miku uoh 

#####

its a really flawed game  hasty port with hastier production ui fuzziness at resolutions above 1080p screentearing freezing skipping obtuse ui but where else am i gonna play miku dressup

#####

                           

#####

this game is hard as balls

#####

denuvo is causing stutters and the dlc songs cost as much as the base game buy the vip edition or pay twice as much later
othrwise great game but even better with mods

#####

hatsune miku project diva mega mix brings the same intense rhythm game experience fans of the series have come to expect whether youre an old fan of mikuvocaloid or completely new this game has a ton of fun catchy songs to play and master it can also serve as a great way to be introduced to some new music and maybe even discover some new favorites in the process featuring song difficulties from easy to oh god i cant feel my thumbs anymore theres something for everyone and a fun and challenging learning curve
this pc release has the added benefit of having a lively modding community with tons of great mods that you can install to add even more songs character modules or restore cut features

overall i highly recommend it for both rhythm game enthusiasts vocaloid fans and also people looking to get into the genre you will be a fan of miku in no time if you arent already

#####

its way better than emulating psp version theres still some issues that make some of songs unplayable on my weak pc mainly the mvs are in 1080p and with cpu being used to play it because my laptops dgpu cannot handle decoding video it stutters making the game unplayable so id love option to use lower quality for them another thing game could add is dimming mv thats in the background so notes stand out bit more

dont forget to remove denuvo after its cracked segaalso consider changing vip edition to a bundle that will adjust price if you already own base game so people that bought only base game first can upgrade to vip edition cheaper

#####

my fingers have gained conscience

#####

jerma

#####

i wasted hours of my life in project diva f and f 2nd im really glad i can waste more of my life in this one now

#####

the game is honestly really great but the drm just ruins the experience completely 

i cant full combo one song without it stuttering and ruining my combo 2 or 3 times in a row
my pc isnt even bad ryzen 5 1600 gtx 1070 and 16gb ddr4 and somehow the game runs like  lmao

until sega patches out denuvo i cannot and will not recommend this to anyone just get future tone on the ps4 lol

#####

my game is holding on by a thread with all the mods i have installed 1010

#####

hoping for project diva x songs

hatsune miku

#####

for those wondering divaller works without issue  d


#####

started to feel the hatsune miku forming inside my bedroom

#####

one of the best rhythm games ive played if youve got your rhythm game done and you need something more challenging what are u waiting for

the difficulty levels are balanced you can also play with the future tone mod i prefer ft mod because mvs are better quality

by purchasing dlc you can unlock costumes and accessories more easily and your fav charas
best part is having kaito in the game 3

#####

insane how you still need to mod the game to make it not stutter

#####

arthritis simulator

#####

miku

#####

its a good game but has an issue that plagues a lot of players which is massive stutters in the middle of songs making it impossible to get perfects if sega had at least attempted to fix the issue id cut it some slack but they barely update this game to begin with and when they do its for bugs the less than 01 of players are experiencing please fix your game sega

#####

this game is pretty good if you are new to the miku games and dont have consoles ps4 ps5 switch etc or if you are like me and buys every game with miku in it d
one of the best rhythm games ive played

all the music is excellent
but
how many songs do i see cheaply done on an uninteresting stage 
instead of putting the song in context
the answer is a ton
ive seen older vocaloid songs done on less advanced consoles with more context to the music and i dont mean to bash the bsongsb in the slightest id like to see vocaloid put in context who wants to see the same fucking claustrophobic stage with pretty lights each time the songs arent bad but the reused stages are cheap in my opinion show some goddamn soul sega show miku falling from the sky sitting in the rain sword fighting in the woods a gorgeous mv something not ooh look another stuffy stage gtfo of here with that boring

#####

if you played any of the previous entries this game will feel like home

last time i played project diva was on psp i played 1  2
theres a new mechanic to me the slide and theres a lot more multi button presses than i remember

otherwise really nice game really nice pc port

ive always wanted to play a project diva game when i was little i couldnt get a copy of the game since i did not own a console that supported project diva

but now the game is released for pc gamers and i couldnt be happier this game is so much fun

pog devs

#####

trust me when you fire this game up your little fuckin nuts are gonna start quakin buddy your little n u t s are gonna be quaking eaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh ehahhhhhhhhh eahhhhh youre gonne shoot cum youre gonna shoot cum youre gonna shoot h o t c u m every where and thats a promise thats a promise folks youre gonna shoot fuckin hot jizz all over your computer all over your mechanical keyboard and your razor mouse i swear to god that you will bust a nut the first time you play clap thats my money back garuntee if you dont bust a nut the first time you play message me

#####

where is gumi 

#####

i love miku this is the best game ever

#####

a lot of the reviews ive seen before buying this game were memes i decided to give the game a try i really like techno and rythm though i dont really listen to vocaloid music i listen to hard bass this game is a lot of fun it reminds me a lot of re rave which i really like

as a word of warning the game does not like screw ups and you dont get much health back its also very visually confusing that said even when im failing its with a smile on my face the game does a lot with charts to make it visually interesting and sometimes even thematic with the song itself

#####

i will never recover from miku bouncing to the beat of my heart erratic and palpitating as i pray for release from the pits of hell in order to covet that elusive perfect on every difficulty for unhappy refrain also rip my thumbs my greatest enemy is now holding a glass of water from mikudonalds

#####

one day i too shall conduct with a leek

#####

 i have done nothing but play mega mix for three days

#####

great game though denuvo is pain in the arse the game can randomly stutter for a second which can ruin your combo and some pvs may lag the game for me it was hand in hand i hope sega will improve the optimisation but probably they wont do much more than releasing dlcs

#####

this game ate

miku miku oooeeeooo

hello i am a longtime and experienced project diva player i come from many years of time in playing future tone especially when mega39s came out for switch i was extremely surprised and happy a game i play so extremely often is on a portable console now and some newer songs were being added into the games finally then i quickly found out well playing on joycons isnt exactly ideal then megamix came out offering both the toonshader and future tone style more achievements that are not possible to get in the playstation version plus the comfort of playing right at my pc

for people who are new to the series i highly recommend playing future tone if possible and if not megamix these games have the highest song count of any game in the series future tone by a few more and graphically the games are beautiful to look at the point of these games were to visually remaster most of the songs in past diva games excluding diva x and for a long time future tone was only available in arcade form gaining popularity it expanded to being able to play the game at home the gameplay to me at least is smoother and easier to combo in when compared to the past diva games and diva x the notes are bigger and say byebye to those stubborn star notes and say hello to sliders future tone has also introduced a new gameplay mode extra extreme in which all songs have sliders in them while imitating the difficulty seen in extreme in these games you are also given the chance to customize your modules even further by being able to combine a hairstyle with an outfit allowing you to personally touch up your songs

as all this seems super fun and great the game has its downsides and i dont mean future tone i purely mean megamix

one of the biggest issues is that the game checks your internet connection throughout gameplay and if you have a weak connection the game will disconnect your controller delay your inputs or even freeze testing this out i unplugged my ethernet cord during play and 50 of songs that i played during this time delayed my inputs and disconnected my controller at the very end of an extreme song with full combo ouch but the game is not unplayable by having a strong connection especially with the help of hardwired internet you will practically never run into this problem

another downside though its small is that you can no longer use pv screenshots as loading screens a seemingly small loss but it does effect gameplay in my eyes i always loved to take screenshots in the playstation version and had thousands of different loading screens

i know i said one of the biggest downsides was the internet connection but actually it gets a little worse the internet connection problem wont be an issue for most players who have strong internet connectivity however this ordeal effects all players in megamix you cannot have more than 2 of the same macro if you do the game will take away that spot from your controller and leave it blank in extreme and extra extreme it is vital to be able to hold quad holds if you want a good score and even a chance high up on the leaderboards in the playstation version this was done by programming your triggers or bumpers in the customization section to be single buttons this way you can hold a note with your left thumb on the dpad right thumb on the button pad left pointer finger on triggerbumper and right pointer finger on triggerbumper by being able to hold multiple notes at a time you score drastically increases especially if the chance comes along to get a hold completion bonus lets say i want to do that in megamix i want to make square my right trigger by doing that it took off the square button from my dpad since this is a tactic used to get good scores in extreme and extra extreme modes leaving a dpad blank like this is a disaster since we use dpad for holds and alternating spam notes as well what you could do about this is you could take advantage of the steam controller layout and hypothetically have three square macros but to me its ridiculous to have the player go out of their way and go in and out of the game just to change buttons for a single song every time when it is so convenient in the playstation version im not sure why the game is like this and i dont recall mega39s doing this but i hope this is something that gets fixed because this impacts all players of extreme modes

well that is my review i know its long and i seem pretty harsh on the negatives but that is only because ive played the game for so long and seeing steps backwards in the game makes me upset but this is nothing that cant be fixed there is always a chance these will get patched though its a small chance do i recommend the game to others of course but with that i recommend future tone way more if the opportunity to get that game instead is the case for others

#####

edit 2082022
 i just learned that nekomimi archive has been added for some reason they didnt put that in the patch notes even though that is pretty major if you ask me hope that going forward they let us know 
 a lot of people seem to complain about stutters since patch 102 but honestly i dont have that issue i only really stutter if i have a heavy other thing in the background like if i am afk in black desert online while i play this 
 there seem to be some sound quality complaints since 102 as well i personally dont have this issue either

edit 28062022 
 i just noticed that playlists automatically pausing when clicking other programs has been fixed so you can now enjoy your favorite music videos while working and such 
 fixed oeideo to ooedo
 made headers bold


yay finally a project diva game on pc ive been waiting for this moment granted i also own future tone on ps4 and megamix on switch

first i will talk about the game itself for newcomers and then i will put some notes and a track comparison for those who are curious

baboutb
for those who have never picked up a rhythym game before the goal is to tap the correct keys at the right time according to the beat  granted that on lower difficulties the notes sometimes must be hit on different timings than you are focussing on because it may follow different instruments and the like but since easy is indeed quite easy i recommend to start with that if you get bored you can always try normal or hard

for those who know about rhythym games it may be nice to know that there are midsong challenges that basically bump it up 1 difficulty step so you can experience what the higher difficulty would be like and i think it does something else like giving you more points but frankly i dont know the only significant difference was with diva x where modules could trigger upon success

all music videos can be watched from the rhythym game menu by pressing left or right when you have opened a songs menu you can also create playlists of all songs in the game favorite songs for easier access and customize the performer even who is performing ie if you want ghost rule with rin as model then you can put her there note that vocal track will only change on a few songs because that depends on if there were extra tracks made for specific characters for specific songs or not

there are at least 250 songs so hours upon hours of fun to be had 

bperformanceb
for me the performance is great the first time i tried it i had some stutters but that was probably because i had too many things open including a stream from a friend on discord when i tried again today everything ran smoothly even with black desert online in my system tray so i would say performance is spoton luckily you can also choose borderless windowed mode among other settings so thats good some games especially ports dont do that after all i do have a gtx 1070 which is a good card although a bit older now if you run a potato i dont know how your performance would be

btracksb
as far as i can tell this is the most complete package but like all project diva games it is not 100 complete with all previous songs

unless i have missed a dlc on ps4 or switch this is the list of new songs added
 bless your breath
 bring it on
 dramaturgy
 greenlights serenade
 kagamine hachihachi flower fight though i remember this was in diva f and one of my rin len favorites

there are 3 songs missing in this version that are in future tone
 ilevan polkka
 nekomimi archive
 white dove

shame about nekomimi archive it is one of my favorites on ft

bmodules outfitsb
as for the modules i did not compare all of those but i do know that the heart hunter module is sadly the ftmegamix version as i expected instead of the diva xf2nd version the difference is night and day the f 2nd figure is right here on my desk as a figurine and it is my favorite module but the one we have here looks like a cheap knockoff i really hope that they will at some point give us the better heart hunter so strange that they still havent despite so many modules having multiple versions

also i dont expect it to be released officially but i would love a module for ooedo julia night her outfit there looks really good and we could use it on other stages i saw a mod of that some time ago and it looked amazing

bplaylistb
i noticed that we cannot rename playlists while that is possible in future tone also i did not understand why there was limited playlist capacity on ps4 but i especially dont get it on pc i hope that playlists will be updated so that we can rename them and so that they get rid of the capacity were not working on a ps1 with a memory card after all

also its a shame that it autopauzes when you run it in borderless windowed on your second monitor and you click literally anything on your first monitor i would love to be able to enjoy my playlists while working or playing other games 

lastly i cant find the keyboard key to go to the pause menu from a playlist start on controller clicking on something in my other screen those work but if i hit enter to pause it no menu comes up and so i cannot exit the playlist with keyboard keys i tried almost all keys so im a bit confused about that

bverdict b
i give it a 910 im a big fan of miku thanks to rolling into it with diva x and im happy that theres finally a pd game on pc yeah i bought it for the 3rd time basically but for me its worth it countless hours of fun i highly recommend it but i do hope my prayers get answered for nekomimi archive diva 2nds heart hunter version and playlist updates the most important playlist update has happened it no longer autopauses

#####

i want to thank god for whatever good karma i racked up to deserve this

#####

i am a 49 year old father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is now 14 my son recently downloaded hatsune miku project diva mega mix and in less than a week he had already played for over 20 hours this was terrible for me as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on tiktok so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game did the tutorial but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought my son and i closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories

#####

do not get me wrong i do love this game ive loved it since it was called future tone i am just so done with what sega has done to this series this is the second time i have bought the exact same game with only the most minor addons just so they could slap a new title or plus onto it the first being for the switch which only took more away than it ever added and i would really like for them to stop doing the project diva series like this put something new in there put more than three new songs in there that dont just become dlc in the next glorified port of this project diva x was not a very good game outside of the rhythm elements yes but the song selection for it was very refreshing and the medleys were super cool too hell if the x exclusive songs get turned into a dlc pack ill even buy it as much as i hate supporting how money hungry theyve gotten with project diva

if you dont really care about this i do recommend it its a very fun game i cant get enough of with many songs to bop to im just so tired of how sega can just blatantly get away with this because vocaloid fans dont really get anything else

#####

works great on steam deck solid 60 fps

very rarely sound would be messed up after coming out of a suspend pausing the game corrects the issue also very rarely a tiny stutter would come in and desync the chart to the song pausing also corrects issue only happened twice in the same session in 7 hours of play so could be the patch at the time for steam deck hasnt happened again recently

oh also good game wish some of the stuff from other games would make the way in i want to play satisfaction again

#####

popipopipopopipo

#####

pdmm is fantastic well it was at launch
just like many other players since the recent 102 update denuvo makes the game stutter at an alarming rate and renders it completely unplayable by creating a delay between the music and the notes even on a good computer
recommendation  avoid this version at all cost the cost here being 400 for a wellknown japanese hybrid console that i wont name and its version of pdmm

#####

thanks miku for changing my life

this game has so much modding potential yet with the 11 patch they completely neutered custom songs pretty much requiring you to get the dlc packs in order to have enough slots for them still loved the rest of the mods and the game in general i can make luka kiss an amogus crewmate 1010 please no more anti mod patches please

its hatsune miku on pc what are you waiting for

#####

yea

#####

jerma reference

#####

if youre already a vocaloid fan this is an easy recommend they finally put project diva on pc if youre not this is a great anime rhythm game with a huge song selection

#####

dont get me wrong i absolutely love this game if you are an avid rhythm game player i heavily recommend getting this one i would be saying that if it wasnt for denuvo without it this would be an easy recommendation unfortunately its there im just trying to play my game that i paid with my money for when suddenly it stutters for one second the one thing you do not want in this type of game its also known to kill your sdd and being a crappy antipiracy software on top of that yeah 

unless you are a hardcore project diva player i wouldnt buy this game a shame too because from all the games ive played future tone megamix this is the best version of those two essentially combining both games into the biggest project diva package to date however if you are an average person just looking for a good time i would wait until this game is on sale or when denuvo is stripped out

#####

i can not feel my hands anymore

#####

great game but why the fuck is denuvo in it

#####

good game wish they could update more tho w newer songs

#####

hatsune miku project diva mega mix has a really fitting graphics for its game style also it has lot of tracks to play which all can give you enough challenge especially on higher difficulty settings not even mentioning the character customization which i think it didnt needed to be this detailed but the devs made it anyway and its pretty cool

however project diva is really just about getting high scores and enjoying the video clips and customization options nothing more also somehow the buttons which you need to press are mirrored comparing to the tutorial until you fix them in the settings not even mentioning that you need to play some to even know how you want to set up the controls because there are some options and gameplay elements which can effect it but you need to experience it in general i also had minor stutters but if you turn of the ssdpsv service in the task manager it should fix it just fine

but one of the most important experience i got from this game is that dont buy everything which is a rhythm game seriously listen to the songs which project diva provides and if you like the style and the sounds of it  then you can definitely give it a shot for this game but otherwise just skip it to be honest i dont like the soundtrack and i found it out from the hard way but im gonna still recommend it because as a rhythm game its insane that the devs put this amount of effort into it it has style and soul for 394 it could be a bit expensive get it maybe around 2025 if you like the style and the soundtrack

quoteh1full review with score httpsyoutubespqyrhtdnsw
written review belowh1quote

the mega popular project diva series has finally made its debut on pc this time as the definitive edition of mega mix a switch release from 2020 cant say i ever expected to see this one on pc so this was definitely a pleasant surprise

bnote trimmed review to fit character limit check video for full versionb

h2gameplayh2
the gameplay consists of you hitting buttons in time with the music as determined by the map and difficulty level lower difficulties will be slower and have less notes to hit whereas higher difficulties will have way more to hit and a bunch of combination inputs and holds

the difficulty here is kinda all over the place you get some really easy ones but then play another song around the same difficulty level and its suddenly way way harder and i dont know if it is just me but i felt like the harder songs liked to backload their difficulty dumping the insane button combinations and patterns towards the end of the song just to spite me

that said practice does make perfect and i quickly found myself progressing through normal maps and then hard maps and then some extreme maps too the variety offered up by these different difficulties and how they are mapped is really where the game shines  there are a lot of maps to play through when you consider that each song has all of these difficulty levels

h2contenth2
the base game has over 170 such songs from all sorts of genres  rock pop electronic everything inbetween it was fun to hop in after not having played a project diva game for so long and see all of these old classics mixed in with some new bops it gets even better if you get the extra dlc on top of that which adds another 72 songs bringing the total to 250  a beefy selection for any modern rhythm game

h2customizationh2
mega mixs customization mode is vast as in it takes forever to scroll through all of the costume options hair styles and accessories available there is a literal mountain of stuff to choose from and even a custom tshirt editor if you want to add your own design honestly a lot of the fun here is setting up custom costumes per track its some good stuff and although it doesnt really serve a purpose outside of aesthetics it is fun to play around with

h2game modesh2
you get the different songs to play a customization mode and thats it while the switch version had mix mode and touch mode the pc version has no other bonus game modes no mini games just the same rhythm gameplay all the way through with the only other real addition being the ability to create playlists

this may not even be a problem for most but i kinda like it when such games throw in a little something extra like djmax respects mission mode or literally any of osus other game modes still this doesnt detract from the base gameplay  which is already absolutely solid  its just something that the game would have benefited from in making longer sessions more viable

h2pc port  steam deckh2
while i did not have any crashes freezing or really any bugs i was a bit disappointed to see the 60 fps lock granted i just as quickly found out that users have already created a high refresh rate mod and it works perfectly without any downsides  at least that i have noticed so after installing that absolutely no issues 4k 144fps no drops stutters anything

controls can be customized on both controller and keyboard and mouse and the game has a handful of different button icons to choose from on top of that there are also some nice bonuses there such as optional bindings for complex combination inputs multipress assist options and even arcade controller support

i also tested the game on the steam deck and had no issues there  its definitely one ill probably end up spending more time playing on the deck than on my desktop

h2overallh2
hatsune miku project diva mega mix is an easy recommendation for both vocaloid and rhythm game fans alike solid gameplay tons of content and customization options toptier vocaloid music  its easily the best rhythm game to come out in a while and i can definitely see it becoming a regular play for me especially on the steam deck

love miku not sega
sega sucks

#####

hatsune miku

#####

hatsune miku is a deity wrought by man but not of man she brought forth a voice to give musicians she asks naught but an ear and a few moments of your time

#####

this game has denuvo anticheat which for some people me included causes frequent stuttering in a rhythm game where a consistent frame rate is crucial this makes the game kind of miserable to play i was excited for the pc release and the new songs but in its current state this port really isnt going to be a good option for a lot of people apparently there arent as many issues when running the game on linux systems though
perhaps someday ill pick this back up if they remove denuvo haha as if but until then ill just stick with the console versions

#####

as much as i love this game i just dont think its worth the money whatsoever 

the game has major stuttering issues and audio desync it happens so unpredictably but its too frequent to ignore it wouldnt be that bad if this game were any other genre but for a rhythm game it makes getting perfects near to impossible

until this is somehow patched or a strong enough solution is found i cant recommend this game to anyone unfortunately  if you have a switch i would say get the game on switch instead obviously it has far less songs but its worth it if you want a game thats actually playable

also side note ive been into project diva for a very long time now but im only just realising now why do all the models lack teeth lmao

#####

i love luka

#####

top of the line rhythm game

the base game has 175 songs with all sorts of other unlockables five different difficulties and other bells  whistles to change up your game

i havent had any issues with the port nor have i faced any input lag
the amount of content the game offers easily justifies the price

#####

1 safe lol lmao someone kill me

#####

an interesting rhythm game with great music and fun customization options

my main complaint with the game is that the easier charts have you pressing one key for most of the song so when you move up to the harder charts you dont have practice with switching keys and you end up pressing the wrong ones when youre expected to do different patterns

#####

as a person who is into rhythm games vocaloid and doesnt have a playstation i do not regret buying mega mix the gameplay is surprisingly workable on keyboard but better on a controller it lets you toggle between the toon style and the original arcade style which is great for game aesthetics and the mv viewing pleasure however it does not have mix mode switch port and is not as customizable  ui and loading screen as the playstation port despite that the song selection is incredible and the gameplay is fun the song selection is majority vocaloid classics and older songs there are more recent songs that are in the dlcs but the base game has a large amount of classics too it does have performance issues with lag but thats just me not having the best hardware

#####

its hatsune miku

#####

b  enter me the absolute champion of gaming catastrophes a fervent simp for the virtual enchantress hatsune miku
 dreamed of frolicking in her digital wonderland and lo and behold project diva descended upon steam like a pixelated meteor shower 
 upon launching my eyeballs were serenaded by a symphony of colors like a harajuku fashion show collided with a cosmic supernovapeak modern japan 
 features galore greeted me promising a gaming odyssey more epic than traversing through a labyrinthine anime multiverse 
 naturally i opted for the suicide mission known as ghost rule thinking i could dance through its virtual storm spoiler i stumbled like a clumsy ninja in a ninja academy 
 ghost rule more like masochist rule it hit me like a thunderbolt from a digital demigod on a quest for rhythmical domination  
 failed miserably even on toddlerwithacontroller mode this games difficulty is like trying to decipher the inner workings of a tsunderes heartits a mystery wrapped in an enigma 
 gameplay felt like osu on intergalactic steroids pushing me to activate no fail mode just to avoid transforming into a pixelated pancake 
 yup im officially the tragic hero of gaming the living embodiment of an otaku attempting a triple backflip off a diving board made of pure chaos 
 despite the glorious beatdown i found myself falling in love with the game like trying to impress senpaiits a quest filled with surprises at every turn 
 cant wait to waltz through more miku melodies hoping to dodge future beatdowns like a ninja dodges shurikens 
 seriously this game is f magical a must for miku maniacs and those who dream of a world where waifus reign supreme and rhythm rules 
 miku is our digital empress a celestial beacon of joy and whimsy we stan and simp with the fervor of a thousand kawaii kittens 
 mega shoutout to sega for unleashing this kaleidoscopic fever dream on steam more miku madness pleaselets turn the gaming world into a virtual utopia  b

whoever decided to add stutter inducing antipiracy spyware to a rhythm game should be barred from interacting with society as a whole

#####

its the most complete release of arcadefuture tone to this day and highly moddable so might as well go for this one although at the price of denuvo completely fucking over your framerate sometimes as expected
it also took me 73 hours of rhythm game gameplay to get the achievement for playing it for 39 hours for some reason

#####

open the game
cute hatsune miku
popipopi in the tracklist
great game


now i go to bed
dreaming about her
touching my hair while telling me everything its going alright
that the voices will go away one day
everything will be alright
popi popi po


#####

a good rhythm game that gets bogged down by an overall bad port

the framerate limiter causes improper framepacing and stutters making the game feel less fluid while also causing you to possibly break your combo additionally theres no option for high refresh rate despite sprites existing for it in the game

the game suffers from random game freezes yes even on 103 that will cause you to drop your combo despite attempts from many people theres still no way to solve this issue

they also managed to make macros worse by limiting every note to 2 binds each with the exception of sliders which get 4 longtime players will know how essential these macros are and the fact that people now have to resort to steams controller configuration for a feature that used to exist is not a good thing

the only thing that i can recommend this game for is if you want to mod it theres plenty of mods available for this game


if you already own future tone on ps4 or mega mix on switch i heavily recommend against getting this as its the same exact game compared to ps4 two songs have been cut ievan polkka and white dove although the pc port and switch version via dlc does gain kagamine hachihachi flower fight

#####

good miku
bad denuvo

#####

the switch version of this game has 178 songs this one has 250 and it supports 4k works on linux to boot for the same price no brainer can i refund the switch version sega

#####

aw mani cant believe i just bought this series again
before graduating high school with my old psv and psp 
mani feel old

#####

meiko

































#####

its very miku

#####

i literally got this game at full price because jerma played it once then got super into it and i love vocaloid anyways so yeah steamhappy

#####

i hate it here

#####












































#####

so heres the thing back in the day i had absolutely no idea what hatsune miku was nor was i any particular fan of rhythm games

several years ago after purchasing my first ps3 ive started browsing the psn checking out various games and demos one of them was a rhythm game  hatsune miku project diva f i thought to myself oh look a weeb game for nolifes about underage anime lolitas this must be dumb and childish and certainly cannot actually be fun in any real way right 
but ive downloaded the demo anyway out of curiosity and about an hour later i was playing the full version 
i cannot even say exactly what was it that hooked me on i sucked hard at the rhythm game at first and the japanese music was really weird but it was something new something unique each music video was special in its own way kind of beautiful the anime characters were like actors and the rhythm game itself was often cleverly integrated into the background scenes themselves

it took me a while to realize that i was playing the game with an honest smile on my face

to put it simply i had fun fun i didnt expect to have but fun that was present with every other hatsune miku game that i bought and played

and i bought pretty much all of them some of them multiple times to be honest ive became obsessed in a way someone may say that im crazy or call me one of those japananime weaboos that sleeps with their weird character pillows or whatever but thats not really the case honest the pure simple fact is that hatsune miku and her rhythm game series makes me happy happy to play the game to listen to the varied music to watch the original and unique music videos and im not ashamed to admit that regardless of what people might say hatsune miku as a character as well as her other vocaloid friends are all cheerful colorful funny kind of giving this positive optimistic vibe and with video games being a form of escapism for me hatsune miku project diva is almost perfect in that role

what about project diva mega mix itself i may have not played it much yet but ive already played future tone ps4 ver and mega mix switch ver for countless hours and i can happily say that the pc version is a pretty much a perfect mix of both versions although its based on the switch one a definitive edition it runs very well looks great and allows for two different visual styles and various button prompts the only downside for me personally is that you can only bind two different buttons for the main notes whereas in the console versions you could bind the gamepad buttons freely without restrictions but thats a minor thing and im already trying out different options for a change

im just happy that the game finally came out on pc my platform of choice and i have no regrets buying and playing it literally for the fourth time

i honestly love this game for one reason or another strong recommendation especially if you want something colorful and positive for a change even if youre not a huge fan of rhythm games

#####

blue hair blue tie she lives in my wifi

#####

with the current huge discount offer now is a great time to support miku and the rest of the gang

#####

edit after about 15 hours of playtime the game lags hard for quick patterns of 3 notes it 
does not picking it up the inputs at all and sometimes the game will just freeze for half a second i will rebuy and change the review if they removed denuvo at first it was fine but as i got back to 89 star maps it was super noticeable there also seems to be an audio sync even after setting up a lag config that many other users are having myself included 

it is the same thing as the ps4 minus a few songs my friend and i went through every song doing a direct comparison between the pc and ps4 version with all dlc for the ps4 and pc version and there are 3 missing songs that the pc version does not have 
1 ievan polkka
2 nekomimi archive
3 white dove

#####

fun game havent run into any issues with denuvo still would prefer its gone but oh well if you buy the bundle and want to earn all the outfits remember to disable the item unlock dlc before first launch though this really doesnt matter much points are awarded quite generously a single standard clear on hard will get you 1k points while most outfits cost 5001k only bugs ive encounter have been very minor the game likes to forget which monitor to launch on if you have multiple and for some reason if you set the graphics style to future tone the outfit select still displays the characters in the mega mix style

#####

while the game is nice since i play from the playstation vita i can hardly recommend it at all the worst sin for this game is the stuttering

the games needs urgent patch some gamers mentioned changed your frequency to 48000 hz will fix the problem but this a problem sega must address the stuttering breaks combo mess with timing and can ruin a perfect score

do not buy this until they fix the game period

#####

















#####

a cool game where you can spend a couple of minutes on

#####

this game is healing to my inner child cringe culture is dead

#####

the real question is why iwouldnti you buy it

#####

i own the game on switch but being able to play on keyboard is worth buying the game again

#####

denuvo

#####

thank you for facilitating my relapse into vocaloid addiction sega

#####

b attention laptop users b
you might get performance issues by default make sure this game is using your dedicated graphics card performance was pretty bad for me even on the lowest settings and so i checked the nvidia control panel and sure enough it was using integrated graphics by default after switching over to the dedicated gpu it ran smoothly even on max settings make sure you check this

anyways if you like miku or vocaloid in general youll love this game of course it helps a lot if you like rhythm games as well cause then youll love love this game the vast selection of songs is fantastic and so are the accompanying music videos you can also switch the visual style between the ps4arcade and switch versions of the game which is a nice bonus i personally havent experienced any input lag either otherwise i wouldnt be recommending this at all

#####

redoing review edit

honestly if you have anything else like aft or even modded f2nd it gets hard to justify paying 60 on this
in other words its only worth buying it if you are new to project diva

plagued w denuvo that means depends on your luck the performance on this sucks sometimes extremely powerful pcs have some stutters sometimes sometimes weak pcs are gonna be fine with it

a total of 0 new songs from mega mix on switch and even then the musics released from switch are generic pvs or straight up mvs from the original song

tho the quality of this franchise is going down since x sega is doing the bare minimum to this port or the entire franchise since x

the only thing that even keeps this franchise alive is probably modding seriously ppl are really passionate on this

finish later lol

#####

my goal in life is to be able to lay on the comfort of my sheets and feel the warmth of hatsune mikus body on me not only lusting for my body but lusting for my inner person my soul the depth of who i am i wish to not only take her womanhood but rather to make her into a woman and to unleash her true potential for love is a curious sort of deal we are born in two halves until we find the one that we love and upon finding that lover we unlock things we never knew about each other before sometimes the things found arent the happiest and pain comes from it but my bond with hatsune miku shall bring nothing but happiness and success for this is not simply a petty marriage this is true love

#####

watching walter white from breaking bad dance to howd it get to be like this cured my mental illness 3910

#####

cantan bonito

#####

that came out of nowhere but its a very welcome surprise
i love you sega

ps

not quite sure why people complain about shutters and denuvo cant see anything game plays perfectly fine for me 13h and havent got any shutter or even framerate drop update drivers try cleaning your pc or finally reinstall ur windows after 10 years i guess

#####

sorry but a rhythm game should not have denuvo i have lost so many perfect combos due to the stuttering and crashing and its been more than a year since the game came out just remove it

#####

if hatsune miku has million numbers of person taking screenshots of her panties i am one of them  if hatsune miku has ten person taking screenshots of her panties i am one of them if hatsune miku have only one people taking screenshot of her panty and that is me  if hatsune miku has no person taking screenshots of her panty that means i am no more on the earth  if world against the taking screenshot of hatsune mikus panties i am against the world

#####

i havent logged too much time into this game yet but let me reassure you this game owns my soul the music is incredible and the gameplay is like crack this is the kind of game you can find at an arcade and play for hours hell i played this game until 5 am at a convention i was sort of into vocaloid music from the little i had heard through taiko no tatsujin but now that ive heard it here i can say that its among some of my favorite music to listen to during my freetime my only gripe with the game is the price definitely get it on sale unless youre like a rhythm game connoisseur and have the money to spare

balso a quick note for steam deck users as usual this game works totally fineb takes up a decent amount of space but the performance and the controls are very nice having this game on the go is powerful

#####

ive got the same stutter issue as everyone else and as someone who has hundreds of hours in this series its hard to recommend people buy this version of megamix unless they fix the problem

#####

it is recommended to install the fps unlock mod for a better gaming experience if you are a ps4 player

#####

great documentary about the creator of minecraft

#####



#####

lower the fucking price sega

#####

miku cures sadness

#####

miku 

do i need to add more  nah i dont think so

#####

i modded this game to make miku and all her friends naked
