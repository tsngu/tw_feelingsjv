tldr a single tiktok managed to set expectations for this game in such a misdirection that everyone came in expecting a successor to green hell or whatever else came to their mind this game is nothing like that i doubt that was the only reason for the game being hyped up but it was at least for the initial hype paired with the performance issues at launch thats the main reason why people reviewed it negatively most never played the whole thing because they werent able to at launch but you are now its just a 3 hour long storybased game about a dude trying to escape an island just try it out its free no harm in doing so just give it a chance dont ignore it because of the reviews but thats just my opinion

if youre reading the comments deciding whether or not to get this game because of its negative reviews ill give my honest opinion on the game here but let me tell you something first this game is a really good example of how tiktok can completely fuck people over 

the main reason for the massively negative response is the fact that 15 as of this review being made million people saw a video on tiktok about the game and like i decided to wishlist for what the tiktoker said taking their word for what this game would be looking back this game is nothing like that review and my only guess as for why is because the tiktoker saw the explore solve fight tag and assumed that it would be like green hell or sons of the forest it didnt help that it also had online coop as a tag which the tiktoker spun into  playing with friends his entire account is just lazy he does that with every game releasing that theres no info on it probably took him 30 seconds to read the steam page and then another minute to spin that into something that would get him views he mentioned so much stuff that was undoubtedly enough to hype people up for the game this set people up with the hope that it would be this and that have survival elements be coop basically so much more than what the dev had really put on his steam page a single steam page thats not even enough to base what a game is like on and yet all these people assumed that it would be whatever they thought it would be 

this game is nothing like what that guy said on tiktok and thats okay honestly its an amazing free game i was running it on max settings and it ran fine the areas looked gorgeous enemies looked terrifying and the people looked realistic its a short game only took me 3 hours to beat but for a free game youre getting a lot the story is almost like a cod campaign where you can replay missions and its entirely story centered you play as jeremy a teen who is along for the ride investigating an island his group gets separated and picked off and jeremy must escape from the island the story has a few twists and the ending is pretty shocking and overall the story is decent felt a little bit too twisty in my opinion but i dont think its unbearable the puzzles are interesting and actually make you think some of them i understood in seconds but other people had to ask on the community page which i see as a good thing if its able to get people thinking and the community helping each other

sure the performance wasnt amazing but definitely better than expected i just want to close this review out by saying please be kind supportive and give feedback to the dev even if negative just remember the fact that he created all of this alone put his own time into it and possibly his own money what did he get in return a game that was drowned in negative reviews by people who played expecting what some random dude on the internet said and a game that would be perfect at launch think about how it feels to him negative reviews are fine but be more constructive than the guy on tiktok lied steamsad because this dev isnt even affiliated with him

#####

the reviews here show whats wrong with the gaming community these days people watch a tiktok video of some random gaming channel that promises them something without proof then people come here grab a free  game and start complaining that it isnt what was promised to them maybe join the devs discord find out that its a single  person who developed all of this not a big team  one person over several months who wrote a story created and managed all the assets coded everything in unreal engine and gave it to the gaming community for free to get some feedback and learn for future projects and all the gaming community gives back are negative and sometimes seemingly funny oneliners after playing 01 hours not even 10 minutes of this game

so let me tell you what youll get their land is a story adventure where you arrive on a seemingly uninhabited island only to discover that that is not the case you solve puzzles such as finding door levers or finding combinations for locks you engage hostile creatures and try to escape from the island
all of this is embedded in a story with a rich environment i enjoyed the three hours of gameplay

are there downsides yes of course the performance could be better sometimes but you dont need to steal a computer from nasa as some of the wittier fellows around here stated some of the puzzles are repetitive to some degree and the voice acting could be improved but again this is the work of a single developer and the voices are of his friends and family

be kind be supportive give feedback where feedback is due even if its negative and try to assume someone elses perspective first please think of the skills it takes to create all of this alone the work and dedication it took and the time spent only to be drowned in negative reviews from people who tried the game for just a few minutes i bet you wouldnt like that too if it was your game

#####

the story of how one tiktoker with one video destroyed great work of one person

#####

given its free to play and made by one dev it doesnt deserve the amount of negative reviews its receiving keep up the work thomas  youre doing a good job 

the graphicsanimationsvoices are fine for a student project this is not a aaa game at least it wasnt priced unlike gollum 

#####

the only thing holding this game back is the performance and some bugs otherwise it a solid experience
its an free indie game for chris sake dont hate on a game just because some random tiktok spread misinformation

great job thomas keep updating it looking forward to some performance improvements

#####

from the bit that ive played so far the game is not bad i dont understand why people are review bombing because their pc specs cant handle the game im using a gtx1080ti with and i5 6600k 16 gigs of ram im not really having any problems im not even going to comment on the but tiktok guy said reviews its a solid story solid gameplay fun shooting mechanics i like it so far will be finishing this later this week keep your head up solo dev this is a good attempt keep pushing forward

#####

the main complaint i have been seeing is that most people cant even run the game due to its performance issues on lower end computers before the most recent update v122 i to fell victim to this issue i have an i712800hx 16 gb ram and a rtx 3070 gaming laptop before this update i couldnt even run the game on the worst quality settings without it crashing now after the 122 update i can run it on the best setting and still get consistent 60 fps maxing out at 74 fps if youve made it this far into the review and have had the same problems before i implore you to try it out again 

another complaint i see is that people seem to think that the game was advertised to have a story coop mode which is false there is however a survival game mode where you fight through waves of enemies which you can play with your friends i have yet to try this game mode out so i have no knowledge of how it works 

also just to make sure everyone is aware this game was made over the span of several years by one person with a budget so low that you could take you and your best friend to go watch a single movies at the theaters and maybe be able to buy a medium popcorn 

anyway with all that aside heres what i think of the game after completing the story when being able to have the graphics turned up the game is beautiful vibrant and yet has that little sense of spook and mystery game play is simple easy fun and usually pretty smooth puzzles arent hard in any way but finding some of the solutions is pretty interesting story isnt necessarily bad nothing to gawk at but i wouldnt say the story is a negative voice acting isnt the best but again with such a low budget you really cant expect the voice acting isnt so bad that it ruins the experience of the game though and yeah thats really all i think think of right now obviously i could go more in depth start talking about the enemies and characters but i really think you should try and see that stuff for yourself 


#####

this game is getting a lot of flak thanks to some clickbait tiktoker who misled people on what its actually like which goes to show that shortform video is a cancer and needs to die but i digress rather than posting another mean spirited zoomerass review like bro the guy on tiktok lied bruh  i decided to actually play the game and judge it on its own merits

honestly for a oneman passion project this is really impressive its pretty cinematic and has some decent suspense and atmosphere from what i played so far cool monster designs decent models and interesting environments that definitely piqued my interest theres a bit of jank with the animations and mechanics but considering the dev worked on this while still in university i can give it a pass that said  performance and graphics are unfortunately a big problem here the textures feel a bit blurry and muddy but the game still runs at a max of 30 fps if that on low settings and dips closer to 20 quite a bit for combat or monster chases this can make it almost unplayable at some points which is a shame since what ive played so far wasnt half bad im hoping the performance gets fixed later down the line since i think theres a lot of potential here

#####

very fun but the negative review bombing makes it seam bad but it is really good 



this is for you developer
most game developers lose interest thanks for sticking to this game stay strong and dont let the wolves get you

#####

i honestly cant imagine what some of these people are whining about

first the bad 
optimization is pretty awful but just turn down your settings a bit and youre golden
the game is very obviously indie and you can feel it from the start  so things like dialogue voice acting pacing and those small types of things have a rough feel to them

now the good 
the game reminds me a lot of the old xboxps2 days especially the old king kong gem on the xbox back in the day the story so far has been unfolding nicely and it gets you curious where its going the creatures and scenery are very creative the graphics are actually pretty impressive i wasnt expecting to be able to see every strand of hair every eyelash and all the details of the human face going into this the mechanics are straight forward and all in all its fun

i really hope the dev continues and id love to see what it becomes when its all fleshed out



#####

dont listen to the bad reviews i came from the tiktok hype as well i was disappointed initially that this game wasnt a greenhell or forest however i played the whole story and i loved it the graphics are great and the story line is short and sweet took me 6 hours to beat i thoroughly enjoyed the story to this game people need to stop thumbs downing this game for something that wasnt its fault incorrect tiktok hype this is a single dev that made an awesome game i highly recommend

#####

looked into the tiktok review bomb drama and can safely say that while this game could be improved in a few ways at the end of the day its a pretty fun play through especially for free
my biggest complaint would have to be the gun combat and one or two of the puzzles are a bit cryptic
definitely doesnt deserve the super negative response
for a video covering the story gameplay review and review bomb drama

#####

to all the haters out there
if you complain about an ai bot who talked something about a game on tiktok and its wrong your fault for believing
is the performance great no
is it the best story no



but lets be reminded its a f2p single developed game from a random dude 
for that its pretty solid
mechanics are not the most basic and boring there are some puzzles to solve etc 

so dont complain if u dont like itjust leave it be

good game for your portfolio and cv great work  hopefully you will find good company work in game is alright for one dev nothing good inside the game tho graphics of 20102012 played for 21 min couldnt play more there is lots of games like this this game as others those type game are missing soul in game and love as i said this game was just made to show the author skill to promote his career and nothing bad in that but still for a single dev this is massive work and unbelievable work

#####

remember that this game is freetheir land stands as a remarkable testament to the dedication and passion of a solo developer as you embark on this journey it becomes increasingly apparent that every pixel every line of code and every detail is a labor of love crafted by one individual

the games charm lies in its personal touch theres an unmistakable sense of intimacy that permeates through every aspect of their land from the handcrafted environments to the meticulously designed gameplay mechanics youre constantly reminded of the dedication and effort poured into its creation

what their land might lack in scale compared to larger productions it more than compensates for in heart the gameplay experience while not as expansive offers a unique and personal perspective as you traverse the landscapes and encounter the intricacies of the game theres a subtle reminder that youre navigating a world shaped by a single creators vision

while some elements might not reach the heights of aaa titles in terms of polish or scale the beauty of their land lies in its authenticity it encourages players to appreciate the intricacies and imperfections that come with a solodeveloped game fostering a sense of connection between the player and the creators journey

playing their land is akin to exploring a world through the eyes and creativity of a lone developer its a testament to the possibilities that one passionate individual can achieve creating an experience that invites players to appreciate the personal touch and individuality that sets it apart

in essence their land is a reminder of the incredible potential and dedication of indie game development while it may not have the resources of a larger team it carries an undeniable charm and authenticity that leaves a lasting impression showcasing the power of a singular vision in the realm of gaming

#####

ignore most of the negative reviews  anyone who uses or affiliates with tiktok is not one bit credible and probably should be lobotomised

with that said this game isnt perfect but 1 its free and 2 a single person made this thats amazing

now i like shitting on games as much as the next guy but this game  everything az was done by this one guy just think what he could do as part of a team 

the game is obviously longer than 2 hours i didnt finish it and for a b free b game thats really good it 100 reminds me of the old king kong game from back in the day i suspect this game is heavily influenced by it 

i was actually really enjoying it until i reached a part where i had to swim through a swamp infested with crocodiles who i was unable to attack whilst submerged and subsequently died to then i was like meh i cant be bothered mostly due to the worsening frame rate  which seemed to worsen over time 

the stuttering was really bad  from maybe 50  60 fps to 15 fps on an i7gtx 1060 maybe my hardware is just showing its old age but i dont think so since the game was fairly stable for the most part but it just grew worse and worse the longer i played not many games make my pc blow out hot air either 

its not perfect but its free and id say definitely worth checking out and giving some feedback on this occasion i dont think the reviews are very fair or accurate as to the actual experience

#####

people believing a tik tok  that the dev didnt even put out  and then judging a free game one guy made is ridiculous

#####

the guy on tiktok lied bruh

#####

atleast you tried man that damn tiktoker ruined your reviews

#####

ignore the other reviews because this game is beyond awesome

#####

was told the story about what happened from a game dev stream i downloaded the game to try it and leave a review that hopefully the developer will find useful

first ignore the early reviews from june to august the game optimisation appears fine even though my setup is a bit on the older side

the good the game makes great use of the unreal engine to create a tense atmosphere and the developer has a clear knack for cinematography this is where the shines the most the set pieces are imaginative and well thought out and kept me guessing through the playthrough however a few times i found myself reliant on the game hinting at me on the next course of action while it might not scratch the itch of the twitchshooter crowd the gunplay fits the tone of the game the bolt action rifles slow and cumbersome handling in the grips of an inexperienced young man adds to the tension of a fight and requires the player to think and use the environment to their advantage its a powerful tool but its not some weightless automatic problem solver while you bunnyhop around other than that the graphics appear on point for what the game needs and the resources available to the developer there was never a point where i felt a texture was too low resolution

special mention to the character animations which i felt didnt quite hit the mark but are nonetheless impressive for a oneman teambuilt game the lipsyncing doesnt quite fit but the attention to expressions is admirable and the head movements while jeremy is talking help break him out of the uncanny valley ingame the model never breaks and all the movements feel natural also impressive is the incorporation of fullbody animations in a first person shooter no legless protagonists here

what needed work while good voice acting is inevitably hit or miss with indie games its the dialogue more than anything that brings you out of the experience in the game its stilted in many places and some parts are baffling like when jeremy says ethan preserved when he meant persevered and when asked why jeremy isnt allowed a rifle ethan says why would we need guns despite that everyone had already saw reason to bring one the quality of the voicework fluctuates a little as if the voice work had a lot of doovers which leads me to think thats why the lipsyncing feels off aside from that while the feedback from shooting is fine its hard to tell when a melee attack is connecting until after what im stabbing stops moving especially with the knife you start the game with ive never died from not knowing but its not exactly helpful when things get frantic as a side note i would have preferred for the lighter to be a little stronger

as the games free i cant see a reason not to recommend the game as a show for what one man can do with the unreal engine there are plenty of rough patches but when the game gets into the right tense atmosphere your only concern is counting your dwindling supply of bullets

#####

although i must admit to only have downloaded the game because of its negative reviews to see what is was all about there is absolutely no reason for 90 percent of the given reviews with the majority of negative reviews having 01 or 02 hrs of play time 

apart from the game not running well  its a shame that people open the game dont get 60 fps and immediately disregard everything else it has to offer
everything is now playable at 30 fps with the minimum requirements which is not great but will do just fine

in short 
if there was a mixed review button this game would earn it its release came to early and it shows in every aspect the core concept is there but the execution makes it a less than desirable experience if you value having some fun for a few hours trying some random indie title than this is fine if youd expect a wellthough out polished title look elsewhere 

to make a long story longer since not many people are able to write a useful review contains potential spoilers 

graphics  710  

 _positive_ it is not the best looking game there is but saying it has ps2 graphics would be pushing it a lot following other reviews there is a lot of detail when you look for it and there has been a lot of effort being put into the lighting impressive it is honestly a very pleasant sight coming out of a dark cave and seeing the beautiful sun rays spread its reflections everywhere possible 
 _negative_ there is a noticeable correction needed with the chosen textures you can have a great looking detailed wall up ahead while some mushroom not more than 20 meters from you will look very out of place because of the low qualityresolution there are some problems with textures popping in and out of existence while loading a scene although it is of short duration and not too jarring 

audio 710

 _positive_ it is a decent auditory experience the sound is directional and is able to followmimic distanceobjects pretty well 
 _negative_ the voice acting is horrible but it does not take away from the experience it gets a complementary at least they tried  

gameplay 510 

 _positive_ there are some interesting choices of play mechanics mainly the handling of the gun was interesting to try out the subtle drop off in difficulty after dying is a good idea it translates well into making the game a right kind of hard while not being impossible the puzzles are a nice addition but could maybe benefit from a choice of difficulty mainly hard and harder could be added for sure  
 _negative_ can be described as limiting there is a lot to improve in this area you get stuck on a lot of things and clipping seems to be the name of the game jumping and sprinting feels unnatural the finding a plank stick and opening wooden fence repetition got boring fast it would be nice to see some more variation or a larger allowance for alternative smart ways to advance throughout the levels    

story 510

 _positive_ for the short duration of the game the fact that there even is a compelling story is good enough the cutscenes are available in just the right durationquantity the end has a nice little cliffhanger which was enjoyable to watch the little notes alongside hidden items are chaotic yet amusing to read  
 _negative_ a back story would have been nice why are we actually on this island hopefully this will one day be added or be revised for a part two of their island it feels like missed potential cutscenes are not skippable when dying or replaying a certain level adding this would save a lot of frustration  time  

maps 610 

 _positive_ the layouts are welldesigned the variation between places creates a good illusion regarding the overall size of the island  
 _negative_ it would be great if the maps could be opened up just a fraction more only a fraction to not impact the overall feeling of being stuck in the middle of nowhere there is simply too much vegetation in correlation to this games ability to clip on everything obstacles holes and plants that look climbableenterable arent the scalesizing of certain items could be changed for the bigger to feel more realistic  

npcsenemy ai 410 

 _positive_ there are enough creative and different enemies that can keep you busy for a while the differentiation between the enemy types is well defined by both the exterior look and abilities of said described enemies 
 _negative_ they get stuck everywhere or are buggy enough to have to restart for example the big monsters on the open swamp field got stuck in front of the stone barrier and the deaf monster somehow teleports through obstacles in which you get annihilated   

conclusion 
its free there is time give the game a try after the developer has had some weeksmonths to improve the most pressing matters regarding the performance and gameplay its rough around the edges but not enough to not recommend 


will replay in a couple of months time best of luck with your future endeavors thomas

#####

the game doesnt look bad at all story looks good and graphics  but i have a high end pc and the game has trouble maintaining a reasonable fps its lagging terribly because it drops  to 30  in some locations google says this need only a nvidia gtx 1060 so it really need fix 

this game got bad reviews because of a guy on tiktok who presented it as a coop game but is not bad only  i hope he updates this game and improves the performance so i can play the whole thing 
this game only has wavebased coop mode

i still recommend it because it was done by single developer and its a great job  it gives free

#####

i saw the negative reviews decided to give it a shot and im glad i did i have not had any issues with frame drops or lag and the game is exactly as shown in the screenshots and trailers the guy that made the tiktok video straight up lied about what the game was going to be and i hope more people will find and actually appreciate this game

#####

their land is a fun and interesting game with minor puzzle aspects some first person shooter aspects little bit of stealth aspects and a lot of monsters 

the mechanics of the game are not the cleanest but they work well my biggest issue was getting stuck on terrain and finding invisible walls being the cause of most of my deaths granted i would jump off every cliff just to see if there was a unique animation there was not 

the performance of the game was without issue the game is problem free aside from the times getting stuck on terrain or surviving a fall into a space with no escape there is no jumping fortunately you can restart at checkpoints to escape these predicaments 

the voice acting music and sound effects are decent i did find that surround sound was not beneficial as the audio seems to not implement directional aspects

their land is recommended as a fun and well made short game the single player aspect is enjoyable in itself the multiplayercoop monster waves seems interesting and i will probably fiddle with it as more people join in the game

#####

not that bad game but it really runs poorly in some areas and insanely bad in elephant area needs some polishing tho but i am going to put here good review because the guy was working on this alone for solo developer pretty nicely done environment looks good

#####

okay then first things first  ignore the damn videos someone clearly got ahead of themselves trying to make viral content  tldr at bottom

a solo dev at university making this as a passion project in their spare time  bloody brilliant things like this will take you far in life keep doing this well done

the story you have made here is interesting  and this game feels a lot like the king kong video game honestly

now the game itself is a little clunky obviously its a free game made by a single uni student the combat can be a little unforgiving as a veteran gamer i managed it alright the sort of shooting realism was a nice touch many people may dislike the fights but its doable certainly 

the logic puzzles are reasonable  perhaps a more free camera movement during those may help people i didnt have to look up any answers but you do need to engage your brain just a little bit

the main thing for me that was a bit of a sticking point was the voice acting  now i looked at the credits i know that this was done most likely by family and friends for filler voices no problem at all honestly they get the point across i just happen to be a professionally trained british voice actor so i pay a lot of attention to these things read on for more on that

the main character being a dutch english speaker with the vocal pattern and translation felt very authentic i honestly assumed while playing that it was mainly the dev themselves voicing the game and they did a reasonable job credits reveal it was perhaps their brother regardless it felt pretty real true to character whether intentional or not could have benefited from a bit more of an acting element but overall was the best voice in the whole thing

a few of the other voices felt quite similar to people trying to do accents  fell a bit flat not entirely consistent but you could tell what the accent was meant to be at least i felt so not trying to single any one performer out but my main gripe was brian probably because i am a british voice actor listening to a british voice  it did honestly feel a bit like someone reading off a page  brians last two lines though felt way different not 100 where i would want them to be emotionally but definitely much closer than the other lines in the game 3

again  please please dont take this as an awful criticism i imagine since this is a free game with solo dev that many voices are friends or free actors in training etc you cannot expect to get triplea quality from it what is there works okay it gets the points across and happy days what i want to say without causing anyone emotional harm is that it could be better even with the same performers  i would even be happy to help with that if you so wished  this game exists and people will play it and form opinions so if anyone is hoping to build any career portfolio for acting off these performances well i wouldnt want it to be what shoots them in the foot i am allowing comments if you want to contact me about that whether for some voicing myself or just some directing for existing performers to help get that immersion settled in nicely no pressure just an offer 3

noone has to take this opinion of mine personally  feel free to ignore me too  i just see a thing that could be improved with the right nudge and would sleep better knowing i offered my help or at least gave my feedback for you all to do with what you will

many thanks if you made it this far in the review 

tldr  game is free and solo dev great work feels a lot like an older classic game i played some clunky play to be expected decent little adventure couple of hours to finish fully voiced but not a triplea titles professional acting dont be mean to the dev  they have worked harder on this in their spare time than most people do at their day job and that deserves recognition all the love keep doing what you are doing  3

#####

i dont care if thomas wins i need tiktok to lose

#####

fun game i have a ryzen 5 cpu and geforce gtx 1650 gpu and 16gb ram had no problem playing this

#####

stop hating on the guy how many of you have spent 2 years alone making a game that is even free

#####

ive not finished the game but im not sure why this got so much hate for an indie title this is fairly impressive now im not trying to over sell it this isnt going to blow your mind but its fairly well put together and interesting for a free title its not even a little bad i have paid for far far worse games than this 

it doesnt carry the survival tag but when you come in the game there is indications that perhaps it once did or perhaps someone somewhere reviewed it or showcased it as such anyone that got more than 10 min in and still thought this was a survival game is kind of an idiot i dont even play survival games and i can tell this is not even remotely close to one this shares more dna with an adventure game than anything else if there was a tag i thought it deserves that it does have id say its horror if not horror then suspense 

i didnt finish it i may come back to it later or i may not but its not a bad game i think one could almost fairly call it a walking simulator i say almost because this is actively a game its not just an experience and dont take what im about to say wrong i dont think free games are above criticism even harsh criticism but i do think they should have a different threshold and scale me personally im not going to negatively a free game unless it was just egregious in either how bad it was how poorly it performed how hamfisted it was with the wrong messaging if its not just utterly broken or disgustingly offensive to me im probably going to just not review it if i dont like it 

this game was none of those things not for the portion i played anyway

#####

it sounds like somebody promoted this on tiktok in some inaccurate way and did it a disservice considering this is a free game its a great thing to pick up it does run pretty rough at times but its pretty interesting and a free thing to try out how people can hate on something free so aggressively bewilders me

#####

dont listen to tiktok timmys this game is actually pretty good and its free it kinda has shades of the old king kong game on the ps2

#####

i dont see the reason why everyone rates this game as bad when the game is absolutely excellent and beautiful

#####

i completed the main game and i can see why many people say its a bad game but to be honest its  really great game for the developers first game the storys great the combat is good the enemys designs and the actual enemys are really good for this kind of game all it needs is some performance changes especially near the end because the frame rate got progressively worse as the game went on other than that the game was fantastic people just need to give the game a chance as well as some time to get better because this game was made by one single person to end i want to say thomas your first game that i know of is a really great game dont listen to the people who say its a bad game like i said it needs some time to fix some issues

#####

people are expecting to much of f2p who is developed by a single person

pros 
 reminds me of the king kong game from 2005 i love it
 the playstyle is good
 it runs smooth no bugs so faratleast for me

cons
 coop isnt what i expected the tiktok guy lied btw
 voice acting was a bit meh

if you liked the old king kong game from the official movie 2005 give it a try
overall for a f2p game focused on singleplayer its not that bad

#####

game was fun for a free game 1010

#####

so the game at first isnt so bad but one thing i find an eyesore is the fonts and the npcs movement to me it just doesnt fit in with the theme of the game but i think with enough time money and skill the creator can turn this into the next forest situation from nothing to the defintion of survival games

#####

as one of the few who actually finished the game i can say its got potencial but its not there yet like hear me out the cutscenes are great and the story is too but its just not polished in some parts of the game mainly the begining i had no problems with fps on high settings but further into the game i had to run it on the lowest setting just to maintain a solid framerate and i dont have a potato pc it has alot of bugs too not game breaking but it def ruins the immersion apart from that i like to see that the developer is still working on the game and improving it i think everyone should def try it and submit their own opinion to sum it up  good game but needs alot of work to be a great game maybe the dev should have just released this as an early access and then the fixed and polished version as the full game 3

#####

after i play this gamefor me the storyline was very good and i like this game rating for this game 1010

#####

on my humble 2060 fps rate is fine i dont understand why so many negative reviews this is a proof that you should never be guided by someone elses opinion but you should try everything yourself bread and wine to taste lips with lips sky with your destiny good luck to everyone

#####

honestly i am positvly surprised after seeing the reviews might be because i dont know the tiktok video which was apparently not made by the dev or because i actually played the game for more than just a few minutes

still after playing the game for a little over an hour i have to agree with some of the negativ feedback the game has received there are some performance issues i cannot quite pinpoint the reason for those because none of my systems was close to being maxed out they are there but that should be a fixable issue however the game is still playable with a decent framerate on a somewhat up to date pc there are some other mionr issues here and there but they are not gamebreaking in any way
the graphics are nice the weapon controls are quite interesting at the beginning but honestly give the game a unique touch the puzzles are nice even though there arent many variations of them they are combined neatly to keep it entertaining i also really like the minimalistic ui and i dont feel like i am missing any information on the screen

overall considering that this game was done by a single person it is awsome the harsh and overwhelmingly nonconstructive feedback is simply not justifiable the amount of time and effort that went into this game has to be appreciated even though it definitely is no aaa game speaking of aaa games even those tend to have performance issues on release 
and lets not forget their land is free to play you literally dont lose anything by giving it a try and supporting a indie dev 

#####

an excellent first effort that didnt get a fair chance because people on tiktok got mad that it isnt a completely different game 

thomas really put a lot of work into this and i cant wait to see the next game he makes

#####

good game nice balls tiktok guy should take all this bad review not u

#####

i watched my friend kill a crocodile

#####

its playable it has fun parts and it doesnt deserve the hate its gotten so far its clearly cpu limited so a good graphics card wont give you many frames per second ive played it at somewhere around 15 fps its very impressive for a single dev i love that when im lost it has helpful hints that point you in the right direction

edit after finishing the story mode i gotta say that it was quite enjoyable the fps problems got better 3040 when i restarted the game and the bugs were ok with how frequent the checkpoints were this dev knows what they are doing even if a bit more polish could help the game good job

#####

good job nice graphs and story fighting was a bit  could be better otherwise no problem

#####

not sure why everyone is dumping on this it runs perfect on my pc with everything on max
well done to the dev few little bugs here and there but its a work in progress
keep up the go work

#####

this game does not deserve negative reviews and the game never made any false claims if people would read the first sentence and not listen to a tiktok the game is not optimized very well but its still playable and when i got past the tutorial i got like an extra 20 fps boost level design is cool too i liked the elephant one i would get the negative reviews if this game was supposed to be a polished 30 dollar title but its a literal free game developed by one singular guy in college with hours of content and its actually pretty fun

#####

tiktok is garbage

#####

how is this game hated so much its pretty cool graphics are dated but i am very impressed how this was made by one person damn good job for solo development

#####

the game is great especially considering the fact that it was made by a single person and it is free 
the story is catching visuals are nice puzzles make you actually think 
if u came to try this game after a tiktok video i would recommend to actually read a description for the game and then decide if its the type of a game u would enjoy playing or not

#####

the game works fine unless you have a garbage pc still can just turn down the graphics and see if that helps but other than that the game is fine
looks great
works great
tiktok is for idiots 
the story is fun
game is single player with a multiplayer wave based mode not a story mode
anyone who gets their information from tiktok shouldnt have rights
the game is made by one person who is in university give the man a break
plus its free
overall 810

#####

worst powerpoint ive ever started on my pc how can something be this unoptimized

#####

bugs stuck in texture

#####

nice game  never played it 

#####

i didnt come from tiktok nor even knew this game was just a few days old people are hating it too much the graphics are good the story telling is awesome i ran into no bugs or glitches only frame drops here and there i liked the puzzles very much overall great game im impressed that this was a solo dev made game 8510

#####

yes it was like that and jeremy was right 
while the game needed a lot more work with optimisation considering that the game was made by one developer it was good the concept was quite good though the ending might make you feel divided i was with jeremy puzzles were actually quite well done too

in any case if youre expecting a aaa quality experience from a game that was developed by one person this aint for you although if you want a decent experience with a decent enough story this is it also you can admire the effort put into making this game

its just what the game implies  some things are better left undiscovered both for your sake and for someone elses sake

#####

free but not amazing story or writing spelling mistakes in the subtitles the wolves are annoying in that they only chase after you and not your ai friends so there can be a team of you and they only go after you the sucker without a gun

the puzzles arent hard

#####

lets just say that my pc nearly blew up

#####

its an alright game with interesting puzzles freaking laggy though got through it with lots  of patience man the laggy fights are to be remembered tons of ragdolls flying around which was hilarious 
last of all ricola tasona

#####

after reading these reviews im certain tiktok makes you stupid

not sure why everyone complains about how this runs ran fine for me im looking forward to see what the developer does in the future

#####

if you are looking for a free adventure check this out its pretty tough to run though this game was made by a single developer still studying in university and i think everyone should get off tiktok for a bit its evidently killing your brain cells the visuals are really good in most areas the atmosphere is tense and this game can be a bit of a challenge cut the developer some slack and give some better feedback than trash brain dead monkeys

#####

game made by one person this is just amazing and i dont get the hate it has some issues but just think about it a game made by one person and free to play this is like a lifetime achievement why ruin it for him he actually tried to do something amazing ppl really dont apreciate things anymore they rather pay 90 bucks for a triple a game that has ps2 graphics no story and just decorations u pay with real money hate on the companies that ruin gaming not on someone that gives us this game for free

#####

good game haters gonna hate he one dev but its like hs many he the goat

#####

the guy on tiktok definitely lied unoptimised af kinda gets boring after a while still going to beat it tho

#####

disgusting game after playing it for 30 min  ty

#####

its a great game people should get some professional help

sure its laggy but i think its a great product for a solo dev

and remember you gddamn fools its a free game and if you mfcking guys dont know what it means
ill explain it to you you dont pay
jus to make it clear

now go f yourself especially you tora

#####

h3 reasons why i recommend it h3
list
    the game is free
    i think its fun to see other people failed projects
    debug camera using the  key you get to fly around and see world design
    the visuals look pretty damn good between the lighting and the atmosphere
    the game has a lot of potential to be a lot bigger than it is it has coop survival an integrated speedrun mode and collectibles and skins
list

h3 reasons why i shouldnt recommend it h3
list
    the way the game does disposition to introduce the story is way too drawn out i get the reasoning to contrast between the ending and the beginning but it didnt need to be so long
    the animations for the voices is horrible maybe its a localization issue but none of the mouth movements matched the words being spoken animations overall were pretty bad actually
    the mechanic for using your gun is weird you need to hold down the space bar in order to shoot otherwise you will only do a melee attack
    the ending makes absolutely no sense spoiler the player is hardly given time to feel sorrow for our love interest dying and nothing is ever pointing towards our character having thoughts of colonizers  bad the entire time his thoughts are just i need to find my friends and get off this island spoiler you know what i take it back the ending makes sense the game just wasnt developed enough to give it a real plot that would support the endings goals
    every level is pretty much the same run around kill monstersbig animals solve puzzles and get to your destination
    this game feels like a king kong fan made a king kong game without king kong theres miniature wolves giant centipedes normal crocodiles and weird made up handforaface creatures that attack you during this
    some of the audio used adds reverb to the voices in the middle of a forest theres no reason to add reverb it just sounds off the dialog needs to be remastered to match the environment of the scene its in
list

overall i recommend this because its free and its fun to see a highly produced dumpster fire of a game especially when you have access to the debug camera with no extra steps that you can find simply on accident who knows maybe theyll add more plot to make it more interesting of a game

#####

for a free game the story mode is pretty decent and the graphics are ok from time to time the only downside is the fact that i was averaging 2025 fps during the game and at the very end i was playing with 9 fps rtx 2060 so other than the framerate problem and the amount of enemies on the final level that i had to face was just crazy i like how your allies can actually kill the enemies and i also like the fact that the amount of damage that you do depends on were you hit your enemy again for a free game its really nice

#####

tldr 
i came to the game expecting its going to be ok despite the reviews its actually way better than that please give it a try if you can and leave a review if you want the game deserves it also  tiktok

genre 
this game is a story action adventure not a survival resource gathering game which is a good thing better than expected story straight out of a 1900s exploration novel with explorers set their feet on a beatiful uncharted island to find themsleves in a jungle hell thrope i would say its executed well and with its own really good twist on it

gameplay and story 
the controls are intentionally a little different to give you the feeling a of a kid way over his head rather that that of an action hero this is not the only way in which this game reminds me of the peter jackson king kong game an underrated and misunderstood game in its own right

there are some exploration puzzles i enjoyed all of them there are also optional interactions with objects and artefacts kinda in the last tomb raider trilogy style but of course the object details are nowhere near that but what makes it interesting is that interactions with these objects give you some extra naration providing glimpses to the main characters past i strongly suggest that you try to find all or most of them as it will make the ending a lot more interesting

where this game shines are cool and unexpected moments there is one moment in particular that i loved and i would recommend this game even if it was for this moment alone youll see when you get there but i would say that this moment must put a smile on the face of jungle book fans and lion king fans alike 

quality 
production qualities are not perfect but really fine for a free game the amateur voice acting is actualy decent the graphics are dated but the game puts you in some amazing sceneries pretty often most of the places have a lot of atmosphere and more variety than i expected i would say the game took me 45 hours to finish i have no idea why steam says i have under 3 hours on the record 

performance 
i had trouble with framerate only once and this was fixed by restarting the game after that i had no performance issues at all also the game didnt crash or bug out a single time which is quite an achievment for such a project

de
ich möchte mich virtuell verneigen
indiegames finde ich immer sehr interessant da eine solche liebe zum detail und auch eigen anspruch ein sauberes spiel herauszubringen heutzutage leider immer seltener bei aaatiteln zu finden ist
das spiel mag an der einen oder anderen stelle nicht 100ig technisch einwandfrei umgesetzt sein
gelegentlich droppen frames die story sowie die charaktere sind ausbaufähig und auch die deutsche synchro gewinnt auch keinen preis

aber das spiel wurde von dir ich erlaube mir hier kurz dich thomas persönlich anzusprechen als ein einmannprojekt mit wenig unterstützung auf die beine gestellt
dafür ist es ein verdammt sauberes spiel

einen absturz dreimal frame drops auf 6fps aber bei einem dschungel kein wunder dass da manchmal was mehr performance zieht als eigentlich gewollt
die kleine story hätte an manchen ecken etwas runder sein können aber auch das ist gerade was die abwechslung der lvl angeht ein meckern auf sehr hohem niveau

ps da kann sich so manches gamestudio in sachen wie release ich ein spiel noch was abschauen 
pps ich hätte bock bei deinem nächsten titel eine synchro für einen sidekick zu machen

en
i would like to take a virtual bow
i have always liked indie games because of their attention to detail and their claim to produce a clean game unfortunately this is becoming increasingly rare in aaa titles these days
the game may not be 100 technically flawless at one point or another
there are occasional frame drops the story and characters can be expanded upon and the german dubbing is not the best either

but the game was made by you i take the liberty of addressing you personally thomas as a oneman project with little support
it is a very good game

one crash three times the frame rate drops to 6fps the little story could have been a little more rounded in some places but even that especially in view of the diversity of the lvl is a complaint at a very high level

ps some game studios could learn a thing or two about how to release a game


#####

nice with great price also something to do for one evening at least

 i checked negative reviews and they mostly were from prinssinakki cs players who have not single finished game in collection you should not give very much weight for those

 oh this does not work with my little brothers 386 turbo  voodoo 2  like cs do

 you should picture google prinssinakki if you want to know what i mean

ps

 and it have absolutely incredible stupidity detectorit have revealed lots of tiktok idiots

#####

does this game have its flaws yes is it sometimes a little buggy also yes but did i have fun while playing absolutely yes especially for a free game this is a winner i was sweating screaming and forced to use my brain as i figured out puzzles and combat overall i had a great time and the dev did such a good job 810

#####

i dont do reviews very often but i think this game has had a lot of undeserved hate

i like it especially for a free game

it gives me a lot of percy jacksons king kong vibes which i personally really like

i had a few frame rate issues with the game but after switching to dx11 it ran decently well

#####

if you come here from the tiktok video some comments talk about then forget the video the person lied about it being a survival game and they are not affiliated with this game still give this game a shot as a different experience

a lovely free indie game by a single developer with little help of others it has bugs sometimes lag with too many creatures loaded but its genuinely a good looking solid game with an engaging story and neat perspectives it can entertain you for about 2  3 hours

bugs
there are bugs of course there are but i only encountered one that stopped me from advancing in the story and it was easily fixed by reloading the last checkpoint a really neat feature it has less bugs than a lot of games i paided money for

performance 
except for a few scenes with a lot happening i got no lagging or performance issues so either these issues of the comments were already fixed or people have to get off their high horses and play the game on settings their pc can handle 

graphics
even on middle settings beautiful world and amazing creature designs the expressions are extremely well made and immersive for an indie game

all together i had a lot of fun with this game its a free experience and definitely worth the time

#####

guys give him some time it just come out maybe be nice and help solve problems instead of being rude

#####

ive just finished the game
the game is free so all its costing you is your time right it has its quirks within the entire playthrough i had the game crash twice frame drop here and there but barely noticable
the game is fun lighting is great dark places are dark movement scripting for enemies movement can be a bit funny and dont run to far away from taiesha you need her to activate checkpoints

eng
preface
a nice short game from a single developer which is really good except for the fps drop towards the end
bim really amazed what a single developer can come up with these days and im also disappointed how fakenews can be spread about a game by tiktok which degenerated into an extreme negative review bomb that must be so painful when you put years of work into a game and you get it criticized by some random people who dont even know the game and claim something that doesnt even exist in the gameb

about the game
the story is okay the gameplay reminds me a lot of peter jacksons king kong from 2005 which is also a really good game in my opinion the animations are really strong for a single developer there are developer studios that sell games for 40 and it looks nowhere near as strong the story is about 2 12  3 hours long which i think is absolutely fine
the optimization is unfortunately not that strong especially at the end it made my rtx 2060 sweat even on lowest settings
bugs i actually had almost none which had pleased me very much however there are passages especially before the swamp come you can skip the miniboss entirely by not looking for the board but you can get to the other side by dodging

for a free game i can definitely recommend this you wont go wrong with it trust me

ger
vorwort
ein schönes kurzes spiel von einem einzigen entwickler was bis auf die fps drops gegen ende echt gut ist
bich bin wirklich erstaunt was ein einzelner entwickler heutzutage auf die beine stellen kann und leider bin ich auch enttäuscht wie sehr durch ein einziges tiktok fake news über ein spiel verbreitet werden können was zu einer extremen negativen review bombe ausgeartet ist das muss so schmerzhaft sein wenn man jahrelange arbeit in ein spiel steckt und durch irgendwelche leute die das spiel nicht mal kennen und irgendwas behaupten was nicht mal im spiel vorkommtb

zum spiel
die story ist okay das gameplay erinnert mich ziemlich an peter jacksons king kong aus dem jahre 2005 was meiner meinung nach auch ein echt gutes spiel ist die animationen sind für einen einzelnen entwickler sau stark da gibt es entwicklerstudios  die spiele für 40 verkaufen und es bei weitem nicht so stark aussieht die story ist ungefähr 2 12  3 stunden lang was ich absolut in ordnung finde
die optimierung ist leider nicht ganz so stark gerade am ende hats meine rtx 2060 selbst auf niedrigsten einstellungen zum schwitzen gebracht
bugs hatte ich tatsächlich so gut wie keine was mich sehr gefreut hatte allerdings gibt es passagen vor allem bevor der sumpf komm wo man den miniboss ganz skippen kann indem man einfach durch das ausweichen auf die andere seite gelangen kann

für ein kostenloses spiel kann ich das auf jeden fall empfehlen man macht nichts falsch damit

#####

definitely not my kind of game but i could really see someone else enjoying it this is quite a beautiful game considering the size of the team that made it if i had to say anything bad that wasnt completely subjective i would say the voice acting wasnt the best and the story isnt anything to write home about though it was interesting enough to keep me going for a bit after i started running out of energy to play it combat was a little clunky but it worked to its advantage à la resident evil where it makes the combat nervewracking and leaves you wanting to avoid it if possible which is perfect for the horror aspect it seems to somewhat focus on might come back to it in a few years and see if i really just cant get into it or if im just not getting it yet
all in all definitely worth giving a shot if nothing else

#####

this game doesnt deserve such a bad rating i havent gotten too far into the game yet but from what ive seen the games not too bad good even considering that its free the only problem ive had is low frame rate people in other reviews say the same thing and have comments on their reviews saying get a better computer but i have a 4090 gaming trio and a ryzen 9 7950x3d this should be able to run ten of these games at the same time and still be silky smooth but i was averaging around 26 fps on this game

#####

stumbled on this game purely by accident heard about the tiktok crap and decided to download it and check out how it looks and performs

performancewise it runs pretty good on my pc 5900x rtx2060 32gb ram with some framedrops on default settings i will prolly tweak the settings later to see what it takes to make it run smoother

gameplaywise it looks like a wellbuild game the voice acting sounds good and you can see thomas took the time and effort into making areas of the game look good

dear thomas keep it up dont let the sheep kill your ambitions


ps 
i will share the games page in my community discord and ask people to give your game a look and an honest review based on their own experiences

#####

hehehehehe

#####


the game looks good but sadly my pc sucks

#####

sad to see so many people who cant read  dont know that tiktok isnt a reliable source of information do your own research this game has so much potential  is now going to be removed due to people with a lack of brain cells not being able to read the page before they download  hating on the dev unreal some of yall make me ashamed to be part of the gaming community this is a brand new game made by 1 person  its free on top of that the potential this game has is amazing for how new it is i cant wait to see where this game goes in the future  i highly recommend joining the discord if you want to continue playing after its removed

#####

see some of the other longer reviews for a better explanation of how unjustified the reviewing bombing of this game is many of the negative reviews are cruel misinformed and entitled

their land is a solodev project and ifreei optimization and performance issues notwithstanding the game has many nice details gunplay feels good and is a great first venture for a new dev

#####

i completed the story in one 3 hour session and it was good fun the puzzles were easy yet still fun to solve i think they could be a few more an lot harder but thats ok for a game created by a single developer or even a handful of them it was really well made and did not deserve the hated launch had some good jumpscares and chase scenes and i found only one particular level to be frustrating the story was not that deep yet it was interesting till the end 
despite all the good comments the game was quite heavy for my pc and with every setting on bad i still had very low fps and fps drops especially when multiple npcs where nearby in the beginning i also had some trouble with the installment but that was resolved almost immediately

#####

only played for 15 minutes enough to make me stop

#####

good game for your portfolio and cv great work  hopefully you will find good company work in game is alright for one dev nothing good inside the game tho graphics of 20102012

#####

tldr its a fantastic proof of concept and story experience for a single person developer while rough around the edges its core is there and the developer is actively trying to fix issues with their game definitely worth checking out for an hour or two it reminds me a bit of the uncharted series in that the game has cutscenes which lead into exploratory sections artefact finding and eventually some combat or a firefight puzzles are a plus too 


i think a lot of players probably came here from tiktok and got the wrong impression initially while i didnt finish the game i think the concept is there its relatively solid in what its trying to accomplish and with the most recent patches the developer has pushed through i think a lot of stability issues were probably caught there the only part that really killed anything for me was with the spoilerelephant stampedespoiler causing my fps to drop to 20 it kind of gave me a headache and i needed to stop shortly after that i almost wonder if it had something to do with objects on screen or the visual effect or camera shake dev note maybe see if you can unload entities when you get through that part and load into the next area

last minor thing to mention is that there are some word choices in english that may not be optimal i noticed things like preserved instead of maybe a better word choice like persevered not a big deal but maybe language could be ironed out a little later down the development line

#####

the game doesnt have the best performance but considering its one guy working on it and its free its not that bad the start was really laggy while the rest of the game is still kinda bad but bearable enough to play dunno why people are going out of their way to review bomb it seems like it could have some huge potential once its ironed out

#####

i dont usually leave reviews but with the terrible reviews this game has been getting because of some tik toker i decided to give this game a try and have my own opinions about it and it turns out this game is actually pretty good it has some great jump scares and the sound makes this game pretty immersive yes im playing on a toaster and the frames drop every now and then making combat harder  and yes green hell and the forest did it better but keep in mind this is made by one developer and its free overall im enjoying the game and i plan on coming back to it to finish it dont be a sheep and think for yourselves pick it up and give it a try dont listen to the haters
dev keep up the good work and dont let these 12 year old trolls get to you youre pretty talented and i cant wait to see whats next

#####

unoptimisedlag like s h i t with an i9 12900kf 42ghz 32go ddr5 and rtx3080 ftw3lol

#####

210
the start of the game had the og king kong vibe and a similar introduction 
after the cave section the frames are just awful even after changing settings the frames were giving me a headache unplayable the controls are quite bad too

#####

i played this game for about 5 minutes  and i must say i never have felt anything closer to a cab tort than this game  espacially the part where i have to keep holding down the space bar was the best  thanks

#####

a great game with an engaging story and stunning graphics

i recently had the opportunity to play this game and i must say it was a fantastic experience the game offers a captivating story that kept me engaged from start to finish the characters were welldeveloped and their journeys were filled with twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat

one aspect that truly stood out to me was the games graphics the visuals were absolutely stunning with detailed environments and lifelike character designs it truly felt like i was immersed in a vibrant and dynamic world

however i did notice that the translation into german could have been better there were some instances where the text felt a bit awkward or didnt fully capture the nuances of the original language while it didnt significantly impact my overall enjoyment of the game i believe that improving the translation would enhance the experience for germanspeaking players

overall this game is a mustplay for any gaming enthusiast its engaging story breathtaking graphics and immersive gameplay make it a standout title with some improvements in the german translation it has the potential to reach an even wider audience i highly recommend giving it a try


#####

ive decided to rewrite my review after what i believe was the end of the game it crashed and closed afterwards due to a bug but do not think that makes this game bad and that you shouldnt atleast give it a try

h2 after playing what i believe is everything did my opinion change before it was mixed now it is yes h2

in my last review i mentioned i quit two times this was within an hour of gameplay it has around 2 to 3 hours of gameplay depending if you got stuck at certain points like me else it probably is around 2 hours long

i couldnt let this game just sit in my library unfinished because the story had me hooked its not something amazing top tier level its just a bit different i wont deny the game has some rough edges however if you look past that then you got something fun and interesting to play 
the world design in an off itself was well made it looked stunning at certain points the view was just amazing which at the start doesnt give you that much after maybe 13 to 12 of this game is where i was fully hooked

honestly there is a lot in this game that i could tell you is awesome or looks amazing but instead i will just say go play it and see for yourself just push a bit through when you think of quiting i believe it is worth it

is the gameplay well designed its decent it could be improved the gun doesnt feel good to use the enemies are sometimes pretty fast which is not always a bad thing sometimes enemies just come and come which is a bit to long this is mainly a specific part towards the end it eventually stops

does the story always makes sense no which is actually what gives it some charm
is the voice acting good nope its definitely mediocre does that effect the game not really i personally enjoyed it made it a bit silly at times

the sound design and music track are just beautiful not sure who made that but is was a great choice this is one of the better aspects of the game it really helped set the mood and create the atmosphere

h3 the rest of the review is specifically written for the developer h3

i had some graphic issues where settings didnt do anything for some reason but that eventually fixed itself after a restart although some textures are still pixelated where others are not on very high settings some textures could be improved a bit with this i dont mean make it more realistic but right now it looks a bit muddy or washed out

the level design itself could have some finishing touches there are spots that are blocked by invisible walls which breaks the immersion of the game a bit there are places that look like you can just get past it 

and fighting enemies andor the area where you fight them could be a bit improved

there is a moment where rocks come up or maybe fall down this is the second gate at the 3 lever level i had huge fps drops also at the end of the game i have some fps drops

the constant wave of monsters at the end which eventually stops is a bit too long i found myself getting bored and annoyed by it that would be a quit moment if i died there again and again fortunately i managed to get through the first time but the fighting and constant waves were not enjoyable i would make it a bit shorter

h2 my review in short h2

their island is a beautiful looking game with a great atmosphere that has a pretty good and interesting story it has it rough edges however as it is free id recommend that you give it a try its around 2 to 3 hours long and was very enjoyable

b i give this game a 710 b

#####

good gaem rekommend

#####

good game good graphic


#####

solid 20 fps the whole game recommend

#####

i havnt played the full game but i love it people who are complaining abount bad fps just have bad pc

#####

at this price there is nothing to dislike here this is not gow but still has a story line some bugs here and there but there is action and adventure and interaction thanks

#####

came from the hate stayed because its a pretty cool little game  
cons driver crashed at the first few cut screen and then fps dropped to 14 around the crocs and stayed there

#####

nice game nice graphics the animals are too annoying and agressive tho xd

#####

im going to preface this by acknowledging that i dont have a ton of playtime with the game yet the game downloaded and i played it a little bit after work before going to bed

while the game could use some polish i dont have anything warranting a negative review i see some complaints about poor optimization while i did experience some frame drops here and there on high settings it wasnt anything that made me want to quit playing

to everyone calling it horrible i hope you realize this is from a university student and its free its not like hideo kojima walked out with an 80 million budget and made you pay 60 cut the guy some slack

to thomas foerg if you plan to go work for a aaa studio after graduating id suggest polishing this game and then using it as part of your resume its not as bad as people are saying it just needs a few updates

also good job adding controller support with on screen button prompts

ill probably update this review later

#####

w game with engaging progression system 3 maps on launch and full voice acting most games released these days cannot compare haters begone

#####

its a free game but the graphic and performance hit is just insane some textures are not even showing
edit other than that its a decent game so far

#####

after the updates the game runs way better and is pretty fun i recommend playing this game

#####

this game is truly phenomenal for not only being a small team but free i played it as it just became available and the bugs were so minor i was still able to enjoy the game there are plenty of tense and exciting moments so im amazed that this is free big round of applause to the creator and i cannot wait to see what else that have to offer

#####

interesting

#####

this is a fine game for free id recommend giving it a chance sadly not coop for the main game but still a cool game

#####

i do love 10fps gaming yes

i had fun

#####

seeing as this game was made by one dev its pretty good sure its clunky and the combat is not the most smooth thing youll ever play but just get past that the game is simple and the puzzles are easy the maximum amount of time i got stuck was less than 5 minutes the true challenge comes through combat there are a few fights that require you to move dodge shoot a singular shot and reload this provides a challenge as you want to make your shots count as you dont get plenty of ammo the enemies will start very simple with a small encounter and move on to a full swarm coming at you 

the story is a quick but interesting one the island holds more than it may seem and the character development only happens for the main character everyone elsewell they are just kinda there for their own stories you dont see much of but it all does come together the voice acting is strange on one guy but the rest are pretty decent 

my favorite part of this game has to be the lighting youre forced to a small and unreliable lighter unless you find other light sources 

overall 510
combat 410
story 610
dialogue 410
graphics 710
replay no

#####

this game was really good the sound graphics and story were amazing and the ending blew me away although you cant say its the best nor the worst but hey for a free game with a single developer that works it alone is worth the time to play it

#####

im only at the start had one crash had all settings maxed out caused stuttering so tried all settings to very bad game looked horrible so i put post processing and textures to very good and also put dlls to performance game looks good sitting at 60fps so far no stuttering so if you get stuttering try this it is a solo developer cut them some slack the game is free to be fair

#####

the game is fun for me personaly it is very laggy sometimes and fps drop low for no reason idk if thats a me thing but a friend of mine had the same experience i played the whole thing and i can say i liked it there are surely bugfixes and improvements to be made but overall its fun without the fps problems im sure it would be much better the puzzles are easy but interesting

#####

guys stop been harsh to the devs he is single dude doing something u cant do u lazy l  so the game is good have some minor issue it can be fix and srsly interesting game i play for 1hr but it can be shape so after couple of month i will play it give the dude a chance 

thank you for your hard work dev dont mind this kids review

#####

honestly the game is not that bad i enjoyed it yes the game has performance issues but overall its pretty fun

#####

just like the tik tok review most of yall lying about your pc specs  it doesnt run near as bad as anyone is making it out to be  for one guy to do this  i compliment your effort and time  half of yall on here saying youre running a 4090 and cant get above 5 fps lol  yall aint gotta lie to kick it here on steam  playing at 1440p and getting well over 70 fps on this game  that makes it completely playable  who cares about the voice over its one guy developing this game  oh did i not mention its free  if this was aaa release we would be having a whole other convo but its not  so keep up the work with the game

#####

very short game 2hrs into it being brand new to the game terrible ending and not a game i would play again one time run through and your pretty much done with it theres only 1 gun available in the game and its hella slow and reloading if you do play this game in spawn waves try and find a high up level to cheese the on coming waves of attacks and just melee to save ammo

#####

it was really good and there should be another one


#####

i just finished it and it really doesnt deserved all the hate it got
yes there are major optimizing issues performances gradually degrade and require a restart and a couple of ai softlock occured but overall the game its a pretty mature product and being a single developer its even more impressive

kudos to thomas for the great game he gave us and completely for free i wouldnt mind if it was a couple of bucks too he defintely deserved for all the work it took

looking forward for any new project he have in mind

#####

i cant understand why people are mad at this this game is good for free game if you dont like it its your problem that you trust a tik tok video with out even trying it it might need a better computer but that doesnt mean that this game is bad for a first game its very good

#####

good game dont hate on it it is one developer working on it

#####

i never leave reviews but i felt the need to leave one for this game as i feel just because of a silly tiktok peoples expectations were high when the tiktok was misleading from the start i also fell victim to the misinformation however its really sad that people have left negative reviews when it was not the developer that made those claims about the game

i couldnt play the game before the optimisation updates but noticed updates coming through and decided to try it again and it runs so much smoother than before being free id say its a great game and i hope this experience hasnt dissuaded the developer into making future projects because honestly theres lots of potential

#####

game runs and seems fine to me shame people let their opinions be made by someone else for them 
thomas i think you did a fine job and i applaud you mate

#####

i was invested in the game and believe it can be a awesome game however as of right now i do not recommend this game too many bugs i got stuck in the map multiple times and when i need to pick items up the game would not let me additionally my computer is a mid level rig and even running the game on bad settings i still received screen tearing throughout my gameplay 

needs improvement

#####

not a bad game worth at least firing up and taking a loot at lacks a lot of polish in the models va work is very rough it feels like a high effort source game mod

#####

the game is bad yes i like the concept it needs a little work i saw it on tik tok as well but lets be true here i see a lot of ppl say its from 1 dude made my opinion give it some time and the graphics and all that will be fixed in no time dont give hate on this game cause of tik tok i dont belive its fair

#####

for being a project by a single developer still in school its pretty good
i noticed the game was automatically at a higher resolution on launch making it run super poorly but after i put it down to 1080p which is my monitors resolution it runs more smoothly changed a few settings to medium as well so the game runs well if you bother to do so as well

#####

i went in expecting the tiktok video likely same as most of you however the game was well done story was short but both combat and puzzles were well done and challenging game itself had good voice acting and pretty good graphics as well reminded me of black ops 2 a bit 

overall i give it an 810 its not a aaa developer and its free so dont expect5 it to be like that guy on tiktok said

to the devs if you read these by pressing  you can access what seems like a dev mode not sureif that was left in by accident or not

#####

gameplay is very catchy but the performance issue is really bad

#####

its free so i cant complain too much unlike many reviewers here yes its clunky yes the voice acting is terrible but it does not deserve such a terrible rating because of some stupid tik tok video with further development i can see it can become a fairly decent game

#####

first off seems like the whole one developer that made this did a great job on the game so far yes it needs some optimization and some glitched spots fixed but other than that its a great project there is bigger games out there that have a lot of people making the game and it runs just as well as this one so good on thomas keep up the good work man 

the game is free so what do you have to lose really

#####

tldr good game needs polishing looking forward to more
does this game have performance issues sure is this game a little heavy handed in its storytelling yeah a bit is the combat unintuitive and clunky yes 
despite all of this i still enjoyed the experience i particularly liked the puzzle involving the hanging pieces even though i have seen that specific concept before i do appreciate the anticolonization message that is focused on even though that felt shoehorned in at the last moment i would have liked to seen more about the monsters and how they came to be and some answers about the multitrunked elephants would have been nice too
overall i liked this game i appreciate the time and effort that obviously was poured into this passion project and the price point was completely agreeable for me i am unsure what tiktok influencer that the negative comments are referring to as i stumbled across this game by chance but i think that people should lighten up and not be so critical over a free game developed by an incredibly small team great job i look forward to seeing more from this team in the future

#####

an unpolished diamond of a game short enough story to finish in a sitting or two but intense the whole time i know that the creator doesnt want to label it a survival horror but if you want to feel the tension of being hunted feeling like you are underprepared to fight for your life highly recommended credit to music for amplifying the tone

#####

this game has taken me back to a simpler time when games were linear and there was just the story to enjoy and how the story developed really was amazing

#####

tldr i recommend this game if you have 16gb of ram a ryzen 7 cpu or an intel equivalent and a nvidia geforce 20 series or later gpu with at least 8gb of vram or an amd equivalent

after seeing the sheer number of reviews saying that the game was unplayable 1080p and would just crash i figured id give this a shot and see just how poorly optimized it is

first up my rig specs
amd ryzen 7 5800x3d 
asus rog crosshair viii hero wifi motherboard
32 gb 4x8gb gskill trident z neo ddr43800 cl14161636  3600 mhz
pny geforce rtx 3090 24gb xlr8 gaming uprising epicx rgb triple fan edition
wd sn850 black 2tb pcie 40 nvme ssd

next the graphics settings that i used for the game
resolution  1920x1080
full screen  ticked
view distance  very good
antialiasing  very good
post processing  very good
shadow  very good
textures  very good
vegetation quality  very good
max frame rate  120 hz i use 90 fps frame cap for my 98hz 4k gsync monitor
nvidia dlss  off

lets review the games performance first whenever i changed the settings i would close and restart the game to clear the vram buffer

as you can see this isnt a lowend or budget gaming rig considering that ive pushed most games up to the 90 fps cap 1080p on ultra settings at all times you can imagine my incredulity that this game averaged only 78 fps 1080p over 30 minutes of playing the game with 1 of 43 fps most of the time it was constantly hitting my fps cap but during the most intense sequences it dipped down to around 63 fps thats a shockingly poor performance of the game the moment something starts happening however even with everything set to the highest setting the game only used 6366mb of vram  so it shouldnt be crashing on 8gb desktop gpus like the geforce 10701080 2070208030503060 or 4060 due to vram limits

after changing all the settings to good the game managed an average of 88 fps with a 1 of 58 fps but there were still dips below 70 during the most intense scenes but it was much smoother overall my guess is that if you are getting over 60 fps you should just set the max frame rate to 60hz additionally the vram usage by the game still topped out at 5920 mb so i still only recommend that you play this without dlss and even with dlss set to quality on gpus with 8gb or more of vram

also i noticed that just under 16gb of system ram was being used during both runs youll definitely want at least 16gb of ram to play this game if the game is crashing then its likely the fact that this is dx12 title and your gpu doesnt fully support dx12 ultimate or not enough ram my guess is that the dx12 ultimate backwards compatibility layer is missing from the game engine

now to actually review the game

graphics 35
the graphics are very last gen that is to say the xbox 360ps3 era mixed in with modern era graphics mainly there are a lot of current gen effects in the postprocessing like the rain effects the way the light and shadows play out etc but the textures and foliage look extremely outdated rocks look really awful while the wood textures are pretty bad and the skin textures look plastic

sound 45
great sound directionality for voices for the most part at least with headphones but sometimes while the mc was talking to himself the audio would sound from only one ear if i was looking away from what he was talking about the sound of rain and wind was fine though the wind noises were exaggerated considering there was no onscreen visual cue for them additionally the creaking sound of wood was very generic and seemed to be at head level rather sounding like it was beneath you

controls 25
the controls did not want to remap as someone who has arthritis this is very important to me i had to do the process of remapping the dodge and crouch to my mouse thumb buttons multiple times before they stayed listed in the controls menu and even then they didnt work in the game hit detection with the knife was a bit janky but otherwise the game controls fine just dont expect to be able to change any of the controls in game youll need to use 3rd party mousekeyboard software to do it

overall 45
this is a free game which adds 1 point to the score and raises it from a 35 to a 45 if it cost even 5usd id be less impressed but considering its free give this game a try

#####

this game has made alot of progress the lighting bugs have been fixed and has been optimised to all heck its a free game just try it

#####

this is a solo creators previewprequel to another project their working on stop all the hating on it
im on a prebuilt alienware and this game runs and looks fine if your pc is trash just say so i ran into a bug or 2 but just reloading to last checkpoint fixed it gameplay and ui could use work voiceacting is finnish  tictok creators did lie about and hype up the multiplayer and thats what i was looking forward to but no biggie free game with a decent story that wasnt just thrown together good game in my book cant wait to see his other work

#####

i have really made an effort really the many negative reviews on the work of a single developer

i work in the gaming industry and i often see how work is not valued so i bought the game and thought to myself it cant be that bad

unfortunately it is visually unfortunately not appealing which you can see in the first few minutes because here wet  shiny even clothes are shiny

the look is okay but much too dark the controller cant be deactivated no i dont want to unplug it every time you only win the fights if you take advantage of the ais stupidity or if the opponent gets stuck and much more

the problem is the game has potential the developer shows potential

i hope he doesnt get discouraged and stays on it

i say thumbs up cause its free

#####

im back and forth on the game like i give them credit for the idea but the games tasks are extremely repetitive

#####

npc move too slow eats gpu like crazy maybe i will wait for later updates

#####

ngl this game isnt as bad as these reviews make it seem at the start of the game my fps was at like 40 max in the first scene but soon after it gradually got to 100 sadly this game is getting removed

#####

this game definitely has its flaws and the graphicsperformance can be 110 better but there is kind of a charm to this it would definitely has to work its kinks out and need a ton of updates to make it better still it is suspenseful and keeps you up on your toes i may have not played through it much and the voice acting put the concept of not jumping kinda suck but its alright nothing like the tiktok video i saw of this game but its alright keep up the good work thomas foerg

#####

scary hand people

#####

considering its a free game overall good game a little janky at times not a fan of having to hold spacebar to keep your gun out but otherwise playable game looks good in some scenes especially with the sun shining through the trees about 3 hours long give or take

#####

ok so i really like these kinds of games its really nice gameplay the story isnt long but its good very nice the characters the way they look is very weird but its fine the graphics man its very nice indeed at first i wasnt to sure of this game but when i got the gun in the game man no one could stop me i was like a one man army haha anyhow in my opinion dont care about the negative reviews there all cringy people if i can say that ha this game i will give it 1010 i would love if more people played this game the survival rounds are fun

ps i think i found a cheat spot in the game in a way qqq poll

#####

first and foremost i like to pointed out that this is a free to play title from an indie developer so dont set your expectations high is the game buggyglitchy yes it is but does it make it unplayableunenjoyable not as much 

the game is a first person action adventure game with some puzzles to solve along the way the story is pretty decent i have seen worst even in paid games and it takes around 3 hours to complete visually and graphically the game left me with a lot of mixed feelings one one hand the scenarios are not bad lots of vegetation and decent lightning details but on the other hand the character models are pretty basic and even glitchy especially the girl that you come to meet she is glitchy as hell additionally the controls seem to be a bit unresponsive and a bit clumsy 
but as i said despite some bugs and glitchs just like that ones that i mentioned the game is enjoyable and being free so why not try it as i did 

honestly i did enjoyed it so give it a go too and support the developer

#####

its a great game for a single developer it has nice puzzles it got a good story line and beautiful graphics the gameplay is very intuitive and quite easy to understand the atmosphere is always setting the right mood with great sound effects and music
i dont understand why everybody rages against the performance it works just fine with the new update

#####

great game fun to play but still need more work

#####

almost every negative review has less than an hour on this game definitely needs some touch ups but for it being both a free title and having a single dev this game runs at least for me better than many aaa titles was super immersive i normally hate games that take your hud but this game did and pulled it off to where it felt how it should have and above all this game actually felt unique which is in very short supply anxious to see what else youll put out in the future man keep it up

also never let brians va voice anyone ever again lmao

#####

awesome game realistic gameplay it could be coop wow the only thing i didnt get is why the character cant jump butok 

#####

there are a couple of thing i dont like but its a good game
i would add an attack animation to enemies because sometimes it feels like they walk past me and i take damage
but overall good game d

#####

first and foremost
this game is free anyone who does not realize that video games cost a lot of money and the difference between aaa titles and free indie games are extreme should not post reviews stating that the game just sucks this is a labor of love by one person 

the idea and overall vision of this game is very promising i know exactly what game this was inspired by and i am sure anyone who played this game when they were younger knows exactly what game i am talking about 

does this game run decently
not quite not getting the best frame rates and settings dont change much however i wouldnt just let this game go because it has some major issues that are gonna get ironed out by the developer assuming however it has very nice scenery and the audio and setting is decent 

overall this is a game i would wait for the bugs to get ironed out i am giving it a thumbs up because of its potential i was also tricked by the stupid tiktok video but this is a work in progress after all and in my personal opinion id give it a second chance after the developer has had some time to optimize and fix mistakes in the game it is a free game after all i will look forward to this games development

#####

the game is bad trailer is good when it takes off that game and when it starts playing you doesnt even look like a trailer

#####

its free and quite fun its a little rough around the edges but the concept is very cool and i like the difficulty ive experienced no major bugs and me and one of my friends have had a blast the past hour

#####

im giving a positive review despite this game being less than stellar its got potential the graphics and performance arent nearly as bad as many of the reviews make them out to be the gameplay is clean enough what stopped me was a game breaking bug where an object needed for a puzzle wasnt interactable

stick needed to open gate early in when avoiding two creatures i figured this out by watching a video of someone else playing the game i didnt get an option to interact with the stick to pick it up and couldnt proceed

#####

no y axis inversion this for me makes the game unplayable other than that from what little i have played so far it seems pretty good for a free game hopefully the devs are working on this and release an update soon

#####

very good quality  very interesting story
i was running the game on a 3060 tuf and in some scenes i got like 25 fps so look out for that
but in general i would recommend this game atleast a try

#####

nice atmosphere and visuals thank you for making this game

#####

i am enjoying the game so far the game doesnt look terrible and there are some performance issues that have been improved but there are still some the game has its fair share of bugs but tbh im having more fun with this game than cod the game is made by 1 person and i think that this is really well done by one guy and we shouldnt be so harsh on it i mean you didnt have to even pay for it heshe could have made you pay like a 1 but they chose not to the game has some really cool looking monsters and some nice details such as jeremys hands shake while he holds the gun the game was promoted falsely and maybe in the future heshe could add a coop bc i think thatll make the game have better reviews and be more fun when people dont have any cash to buy a new game

#####

1010 uninstall works great

#####

seen this game as a ad on youtube it was pretty good first off i gotta say rip my boy ethan winters they doing my boy dirty and my guy got attacked my his barber in this game rip his haircut too i give jeremy props my dude stood ten toes on this island mans became farcry protagonist the ending exactly caught me off guard it was wild wont say too much on that put for as the campaign goes it was nice far as the other modes didnt get into them and just too though this in i really liked the arm animation it just showed how scared he was everytime he shot cause them monsters are wild it made me think the game took place in skull island overall 810

#####

amazing game for free jump scares and dark cave exploring i am enjoying it so far

#####

just normal free game with own story and interesting creatures thx

#####

awesome game would recommend to everyone everyone needs to try this game story is full of depth and very interesting

#####

this is fun and free so quit your damn whining a solo dev drops a cool new game on steam for free and yall shit on it this is why we cant have nice things

#####

shit graphics u need nasa computer to run on good settings cant turn of monitor blur

#####

the game is pretty decent for being made by 1 single dev then offering peeps to play it for free its very neat being that it was created by 1 person

#####

the graphics are so bad and you basically need a nasa computer to run the game in good graphics i have a good computer and cant even run it at medium settings and the game doesnt even look good the animations for the game are straight trash and when the characters talk it doesnt even match up with what there saying this game is for monkeys and the zoo should use this as a learning possibility for silverback gorillas just joking

#####

yo this game is straight garbonzo why do u have to hold space to bring out the weapon like i aint trying to hold space all game just to shoot worst game ever

#####



#####

i cant get further than the welcome sign 



#####

trash

#####

hella mid even roblox has better graphics than this game lmao

#####

my pc lighted on fire but didnt explode nice


#####

this gameahhh
you need a nasa computer to run it and from the cinematics that i saw it looked good but in the real game itsmeh
buy sons of the forest or green hell instead sorry but this is a real letdown 


#####

the best settings are the same as the worst settings keep practicing and actually make the settings change

#####

the controls need some help and the coop isnt really coop its literally just waves and this game needs a chill pill on the graphics mhmm mayonnaise

#####

its fun how bad the game is the trailer is comeplete clickbait dont even try it just a waste of time

#####

the game is running so bad that even on the lowest settings i have max twenty fps and i should have a good enough pc for the game

#####

i think the level design was good but the performance issue and horrible story didnt make up for it the voice acting was horrible it was the same puzzles and the combat was boring  it had potential but clearly didnt live up to  it i hope the dev learns from his mistakes in this game and does better on his next props for the higher graphics displayed especially by a solo dev

#####

idk why everyone is upset but i thought this game was great and challenging yes there might be a small graphic issue here and there but my goodness did people miss the details the freckles on the skin texture it took my breath away i think the only thing i was confused on when i was reading the story about the hide and seek took me a second to realize i was hoping between the past and present other then that a great game made by a solo dev cant wait to see more

#####

really bad game  frame drops not optimised

#####

what did i play

#####

pure shite

#####

it sucks i tryed to play with my friend but it lagged to much and there were to many monsters at the start

#####

this game is pretty boring

#####

i understand its f2p game but wow its unplayable even on lowest graphics game is lagging like crazy

#####

this game is made by one guy which is respectable while the performance is poor and a lot of the acting has issues its still an impressive looking game i think this is a great start for the dev and i hope he finds a great job 

other than that fix the poor performance and ill happily change my review to recommended

#####

dont bother playing coop is only wave based instead of playing the actual game coop with friends lol also runs horribly

#####

i cannot recommend this game to anyone this game  is 20 years behind nothing innovative old mechanics bad graphics and very poorly coop is only wave survival based fake coop the only pro is that its free but i guess charging anything for this game would be quite sad

#####

the besterest game ever graphic so good like realism

#####

this has to be one of the worst if not the worst optimised games i got around 5060 frames playing on high settings i paused the game and was busy for around 30 minutes but when i came back i was stuck on 1618 fps i tried switching to the lowest possible graphics but it did nothing the story is extremely boring and repetitive you find an area that you have to cross search for a plank fight enemies get the plank cross the area repeat the aiming can also be improved most of the times i found it easier and more accurate to use my rifles stabbing feature than to actually shoot the thing this looked like a promising and fun game but i dont think i will be finishing it

#####

没有中文差评
建模丑的一批还穿模了
游戏流畅度也不高真心不建议入坑不如森林

#####

try harder    tiktok guy lied

#####

can confirm that tiktok guy lied

#####

nah

#####

preety boring game

#####

its alr i guess only problem is the lack of content you just beat the story mode and then you cant do much other than survival thing

#####

so underrated

#####

the game poorly optimizing well maybe because is 14 person made this i can have 60 fps but when all setting low

#####

their land is definitely a labour of love but its a labour that does not fruit something sweet to play a somewhat unpolished game which cannot be helped considering this game was entirely by one developer their land lacks direction and at times leads to the player being utterly confused not as to what to do or how to do it but rather in questioning if its even possible to do what the game asks the path to continue the story is obscured in such a way that it feels more like the path to an easter egg and not the intended direction more than once i ended up waiting until a ping on screen would direct me the right way cause finding the right path was something that required too much effort for a linear action game

i believe their land offers a lot of interesting design ideas and borrows mechanics not seen since the official game of peter jacksons king kong but that alone does not make it a game that is enjoyable

and yes it runs sluggish no matter what the graphic settings optimisation is not great the dev has attempted to fix these issues but it feels as though even with its improvements to v141 it still runs sluggish and needs to perhaps be taken back to the base level to optimise it fully

#####

look this game only has one developer and from that standpoint the game is impressive i can tell this took a lot of work to make something like this regardless of how terrible the optimization is and cheesy the voice lines are  i feel bad for the dude simply because a tiktok video went viral with coverage of this game claiming it was open world adventure survival which led a lot of folks  to expect this game to deliver on that despite the tiktoker intentionally spreading misinformation 

regardless of these facts i played the entire game on youtube so you dont have too 

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv8zvwb1erto

#####

15 min played i would like a refund of my time 


#####

runs just fine on my pc at max settings 1010

#####

tiktok guy lied to me also game runs at 13fps max 144p textures

#####

who let bro be the manger of the tiktok account

#####

this game got to be one of the worst games ive ever player pure shit false marketing graphics is poop

#####

ass

#####

dog

#####

i get it is free is low budget but  bro you need a freaking nasa pc to run this like te game is so laggy and the checkpoints are so far from each other also the mechanics are very bad

#####

this game is very good but i got cancer when i started it and it is optimized like i made it

#####

i wanted to like this game so much after all these reviews but i just cant i dont have any problems with the optimization i mean yea it uses a lot of my gpu but i highly doubt anyone would put this much effort into a crypto miner plus the crypto market just crashed i just simply hate the fact that at the start every npc has a gun while you can get gangbanged by the wolfs because you only have a knife which takes like 3 hits to kill 1 damn wolf while 4 more bites the crap out of you

i hope in the future the game will be more enjoyable

#####

for a new game release its bad

#####

this game is ass

#####

total garbage man
graphics from 2009 
gameplay feels even worse than agony 
this is agony
uninstall  remove from account
yeah its a real turd that one

#####

i couldnt see the sun

#####

i know its an early access game and all but it doesnt even resemble the fucking trailers the game is an obvious bitcoin miner as my computer which is decently good specced couldnt run this game at a higher frame rate than fucking 14 fps story is extremely boring cutscenes lag for some whatever reason character voices disappear after changing a setting in the middle of a cutscene the coop is literally just a shit survival mode in which wave 1 throw 50 million enemies at you when you dont even know how to pull out the fucking gun so you just get fucked over in 5 seconds

#####

it is a fun game



#####

short onrails limited actions annoying puzzles bad ending

#####

this game is soooo bad dont download it

#####

tiktok man lie this game sucks

#####

the introduction of the early plot is not bad but it is very stuck the frame drop is serious do a good job of optimization otherwise it is really difficult to have a reason to play

#####

if there was a game id tell you to stay away from itd be this i dont even know what the story is even supposed to be about or why youre on the island it just drops you in and they expect you to be fully interested but it tells you zero fairly repetitive as well as it keeps telling you over and over to find logs to cross gaps that you can clearly jump as it gives you a dash ability but not for jump theres these artifacts that you find but its just basic stuff like bowls and cups but they have a paragraph of history for it and its like why why should i be interested in little artifacts if my objective is to escape the island the performance is terrible always hovering between 20  40 fps with an i9 11900k and rtx 3070 using dlss as well and most textures looking decent while others look completely muddy gun play and combat is atrocious melee does absolutely nothing to refrain from you getting attacked as 100 of the time you indeed do get attacked before you can actually attack and you cant actually shoot your rifle unless you hold the god damn space bar the only positive is probably the creatures designs honestly oh and get ready to see an abundance of loading screens for literally no reason you can be in one area and then enter a next and then itll fade to black and then pop you out into an entirely new area i may try and finish this and if i do i doubt this review will change much at all

#####

great game the graphics are amazing
for one developer this games amazing great job

#####

can see that the game is not entirely ready can not handle smooth 2k 100 fps on my 3070ti 
with that said the game still have potential allowing 4 players the story line is interesting and indeed i just need some substitute for son of forest and green hell
hope this can get better with later updates of later versions

#####

20 fps

#####

just wait until its fixed it moves like 1 frame per second

#####

buggy as hell and glitches needs ton of work but is free

#####

your games optimization is a piece of shit

#####

this game sucks just download forest

#####

huge disappointment

#####

after playing for an hour i wouldnt really recommend this if they dont fix the performance issues i had the same 2014 fps even on the highest settings and on the lowest settings i physically feel ill because the framerate was too low i wouldnt make a super big deal out of it if you didnt have so much combat other than that i love the gun shaking and how you check ammo count and the way it sways around its otherwise really cool and hope you continue making games

#####

game is hot trash and the voice acting is terrible 100

#####

tiktok dude lied

my pc nearly blew up

#####

doesnt even load me in lmao

#####

this game was horrible i thought it was going to be coop so i could play with friends but its literally a horrible story mode that is so buggy and laggy its almost unplayable i turned down the graphics to the lowest setting and it was still horrible the game consists of finding the lever and doing basic puzzle solving i was so disappointing it looks nothing like the pictures and trailers the game was the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life i wont be getting back find the lever  find the lever find the lever  oh your getting attacked by a giant monster go ahead and find three levers this time ps if you loving shooting while having to hold space bar this game is for you

pss the only reason i have 2 hours is because i thought i was playing a prologue then like a multiplayer would unlock but i was dead wrong but ended up playing the whole story mode
gots to see it through my boy gots to see it through

were nice game 10010

#####

i know it just came out an its free but its so copy and paste of other freeto play survival games nothing really stands out about it game is pretty bad

#####

thomas youre awesome dude dont pay attention to the idiots that have been putting down this game
ive always wanted to work in game development but ended up never getting the chance to do so you have singlehandedly created a great game and shared it for free
please do not get discouraged this is an awesome project and it was really fun and challenging to play yes there are many things to be improved but its absolutely amazing you did this all by yourself kudos my friend and please keep them coming cheers

#####

shit garbagio stayed up for a late ass release only way to play with friends is bunk ass survive mode story weak 1010 would not reccomend

#####

free or not this games trash dont waste your time

#####

dis is game so dogshit i finished the game and man while i was going trough the game my fps  just dropped lower also story was bad horrible my head startted hurting from playing dis game in the future dis probbably will be a torture in the future

#####

optimize the game thomasbecause is so laggy and most of us cant play because its not optimized
try to make it multiplayer and try to find a team to work on the game

#####

cant even shoot lmao terrible game

#####

as my experience this is a awesome game with realistic graphics and movie like story i got a vibe in gameplay like watching king kong whatever i had a good experience from this game i appreciate the indie dev nice work
i dont know why most people have a negative review maybe bcoz at the first time this game is buggy or anything but literally as my experience i never faced any bug in this game and my gpu is rx 6500 xt still i can play this in high graphics now its a well optimised game but i dont even completed yet

#####

it was actually decent and not worth a negative review

#####

i have to say considering such a small team this game is very good  love the story line i ran this game with asus 2080ti oc edion att 144 fps at highest settings without issue

#####

hoping youll do better in your future games

#####

as much as i really wanted to like this game its just way laggy it really needs to be optimized more if you have a highend pc then this is the game for you very well made excited for whats to come

#####

i played on the lowest graphics of the game and i still enjoyed how it looked plus the story was really fun to play and complete if your board and looking for a free game give this a shot

#####

terrible dont listen to the tiktok guy its so shit

#####

shit game some cutscenes are skipable others are not

shit performance prob a bitcoinminer

dont get this game

#####

very repetitive boring no multiplayer false advertisement

#####

this game has some pretty good graphics for a free game but the game play is what is really lacking have the time your in the game youll be waiting for the snps to catch up and there is so many dialogue things u cant skip the game overall is a 110 i would download it and play it if u really want a boring experience but this game does have potential and i can see it going somewhere but far cry primal does its job better

#####

dont even bother

#####

bro wtf i got a good pc and its still unstable asf lmaoooo stop releasing pieces of shit and finish it to a polished turd

thx

#####

one of the best games i have tryed the story is okey but playing with freinds on wipe is fun recemended

#####

is not good

#####

boring asf

#####

quite a decent game for a solo developer but i cant recommend it 

the graphics seem close to games from maybe 2010ish which is no problem because it kind of looks like an art style

the performance though on max settings with dlss on quality is horrendous with a 3070ti and 32gb ram the start was kind of ok getting around 7090 with occasional drops to 2030 and then back to 7090 but after getting into the jungle areas it starts to go very downhill at the crocodile area the frames were at 1821 i would understand if the game had a hell of a lot going on and amazing graphics but it doesnt and i also didnt notice any fps gain between performancequality dlss im not really sure why dlss is even a feature though

i dont know if there was any real story or not as i stopped playing shortly after the crocodile part as it just wasnt enjoyable for me

im not sure why there is a speedrun or a hordewave mode featured i tried the horde mode but it was not at all fun and just felt like i was playing the story mode again but with waves of enemies

i dunno what the thought process was for making the gun aim button space bar it was very off putting for me the knife was also very very useless and so was the lighter

in saying all of that though i am curious to see what you will do next

#####

nah this game is that not good 


#####

just a not so good story with fine graphics horable invisible walls and extremely repetitive gameplay would not recommend

#####

mechanics are bad

#####

this should not be free

#####

the game unfortunately fell victim to a foolish tiktok propaganda xd

#####

decided to give this game a chance after seeing all the negativity from which a tiktok user had created false information with this game its not n my top 10 nor my top 100 however i would probably play this game again when im bored and have nothing else better to do

considering 1 man created this it is very advanced but i do need to make aware that the graphics do need updating to the 21st century resource pack other than that its an alright game

#####

best game i have ever played great job thomas

#####

this is a beautiful game with an amazing concept strikehowever im struggling to recommend it in the state that its in and it would pain me to put not recommendedstrike

striketo start off i really wanted to enjoy this game but the more i played the more lag i experienced reopening the game was a temporary fix but i feel that shouldnt be necessary as it happens pretty quickly strike edit performance issues mostly fixed strikeonly small stuttering but strikehuge improvements to performance

i enjoyed the experience so much i was willing to play through the game until my fps was at a struggling 1213fps i even enjoyed the zombieslike wave based survival game mode its a concept that really complements the game fps issues fixed and performance steady now 11923

overall its a well made game i hope will be successful in the future strikebut i need more very easy optimization updates in order to truly recommend the gamestrike same as edit above

complements to the single dev working on this cant wait to see more dont let the tiktokers ruin this game

edit 62523 performance issues hugely fixed only few stuttering issues

#####

this game is crazy good for a solo developer after release he released 3 updates in a few days to address the poor optimization and it runs much better im hoping he can overturn the ridiculous negative reviews on his free game

#####

bad


#####

trash game bad graphics and lagging af

#####

too lag inside the game

#####

runs completely fine on the following specs rtx 2060 ryzen 5 3600 32gb 3200hz the graphics really are not that bad at all yes you can tell its not a polished game but for a single developer this game plays and runs amazingly i only get fps issues during loading and some cuts scenes other than that this game is completely enjoyable single player in some ways im getting the look and feel of the plague game series props too the developer i will hopefully be posting gameplay and real info about the game to tiktok highguysofficial

#####

the good way to start the review is to mention after all the critics that the game is free but i support to say that it is a big lie in the promotion of the game having extremely bad graphics the game being extremely poorly made i support the fact that the game has so many negative reviews because of the lies in the trailer and promotion i recommend giving 1020 euros and getting the forest or the sons of the forest the game is extremely weak from the graphics to the movement to the interactions in the game

#####

no

#####

damn ass graphic my computer run with 7 fps wtf

#####

crashing

#####

single player optimization  0
multiplayer optimization  8
game play  410
voice over  310
story  410

to be honest i didnt know about the hype the game was getting from tiktok  after playing the single player campaign i was astonished that my computer didnt crash during the big fight towards the end  i see the love that is in this game but i also see where some stuff needs more work  after my original review i decided to go back in with a refreshed mindset and boy did i forget to mention that i absolutely hate hyped games with lies spread all around it  my friend had shown me a few of the hype videos and this one httpswwwtiktokcomcallthecafevideo7240922456473603370_r1_t8haq4budqlx
was by far the worst  i am sure the game can grab an audience if it keeps getting more improvements  not the worst game out there  it has some impressive moments but the optimization really got bad after half way through the story  the voice overs exist but the quality of sound changes per person and sometimes it feels out of place  if this game existed back in 2006  2008 i can see it having a fan base  i like to collect achievements so i will play it more to get them all  hopefully i can see this game turn into something even bigger  keep up the work  i cant recommend the game entirely but it is something to look to look at

#####

on release was pretty laggy but i dont regret finishing this voice acting is a little off but for a single developer this is pretty good

#####

game is badgame has very bad quality and is very delayeddo not play this game

#####

game is bad dont waste ur time on it plus cant even change ur keybinds makes it worse have to use spacebar to pull out your weapon its very laggy 

#####

i beat the game with literally 5 fps to spare the best thing about this game is the low polly demogorgons and the 4 trunk elephants were amazing the fight with cthulhu was something to write home about i cant wait to never play this game again i give it a 110 just because the graphics are good when you see the rain on the gun

#####

trash game i can t even check the privacy note to play this piece of garbage

#####

laggy game bots would join my lobby  had a terrible experience was not able to last 10 min in it
