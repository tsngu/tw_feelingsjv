i wanted to wait until i had 100 hours into this game to give it a review i wanted to have plenty of time put into it with it being an early access title ive played mainly solo most games like this i do just a personal preference until i have beat the game this game is an early access the only bug i have ran into is an item tooltip describing what the item is the game feels completed even though it is not you cant say that for a lot of early access games now a days

lets start off with the building aspect this game offers the terraforming can take a little to get used to you cant just dig with a pickaxe underneath the layer above you must take it all the way down with you not being able to dig a cave you must dig the whole area out and build in the area if you wanted to build an underground dungeon for example you unlock building items as you progress through the game i like this aspect i suggest waiting until the final tier if you plan to build fancy while building you must add support just like in the real world cool concept you must be within a certain distance of a workbench forge or stonecutter while building certain building aspects require a different crafting table

now lets talk about combat combat in this game can be very challenging if you are under geared you cant go from the tier 1 zone and expect to survive in combat in the tier 3 zone there are creatures that can 1 shot you if you are not prepared eat the right food for more health and have the right gear for the zone on the boss fights i enjoyed in this game what more can you ask fighting a deer with chains hanging off his antlers while metal music starts playing mobs from one biome will fight others from another it seems skeletons will fight any mob even if they are from the same biome it can be a sight to roll up on some greydwarves trying to fight the skeletons it can take time to acquire the materials to craft gear sense you cant use a teleport with ore this means you either walk or travel by boat

traveling by boat can bring a lot of great views watching a storm while in the middle of the ocean a lightning bolt dancing across the sky shortly after being able to watch the clouds dissipating the stars shining with a purple hue in the sky can be mesmerizing some people may not enjoy the graphics of the game say it looks too old its the perfect art style for this game in my opinion the physics in this game are amazing you chop a tree down and it factors in slop chopping direction and wind into its fall direction theres rain and snow fall in the game which can cause you to become wet and freezing 
crafting in this game is well done for the most part in my opinion there is a few recipes that need to be tweaked you shouldnt need 20 of iron bars but only a small amount of wood to craft a bow for example drop rates for crafting mats seem well placed except of ancient wood my opinion it needs to be lowered to same levels as the other special woods you can plant a garden plant trees tame animals to have quick access to furs and meat

after many hours of crafting combat building and exploring a game that is 1gb yes 1gb has brought me a ton of fun reminds me of the first times playing minecraft or terraria ive been looking for a game to bring that feeling back
all in all i highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys these style of games as i do please if you enjoyed reading this or found it inciteful upgrade this review

ill see you in valheim


i just want to say thanks for all the awesome feedback of my review sorry i live in texas and have been without power for 3 12 days you guys are awesome thank you so much for reading

its criminal that a team of 5 people can build such an amazing game like this and sell it for 20

i continue to be amazed at the thought that went into this game and all the little details from the changing weather the waves in the ocean the ebb and flow of the water along shorelines the smoke from the campfire as it fills the room the ease and simplicity when it comes to building the way the trees fall the music that feels seamless and relaxing and so on

i truly appreciate that they didnt make an open world simulation that simulates things for no other reason than to simulate them made a mistake while building that house no worries just remove it and get all your materials back ran out of food while busy building or crafting no worries youre not going to die from hunger broke your axe no worries just repair it troll smashed your cart full of ore no worries just put down a workbench and rebuild the cart and put everything back in the cart

#####

it got a craftingboss progression similar to terraria
it has dark soulslike combat and punishment for death
it got worldbiome generation similar to minecraft
it got textures like a ps1 game
it got lighting like a 2020 aaa game

it sounds weird but its absolutely fantastic

#####

im a 63 year old gamer  been playing since 1977 when the atari 2600 came out with pong as the big thing i have primarily enjoyed openworld exploration games like oblivion skyrim and fallout4 which i have played many hours on   i have already done 555 hours on valheim which has some the most amazingly beautiful realistic not to mention dangerous biomes i have ever seen despite the low detail  the different climate effects mixed with the lightling and weather are superb  and the sound effects are so realistic especially the lightning and thunder storms  the crafting and settlement building along with you picking where youre going to settle is so great definitely one of the best games i have ever played

#####

for us 50 year olds who are just learning to game on a computer this is a great game my sister and i have played some farming type games on a switch but were ready for a bit more we are having fun with this one

#####

i dont know how these devs did it but i havent felt like this playing a game in a really long time its a true adventure 
so much depth created in a 500mb game buy it

#####

in a span of 2 months i have put 230 hours into valheim solo i would highly recommend this game to anyone reading this review to play alone or with up to 9 friends i have not encountered a single bug and while this is an early access game this is a full experience some key features that drew me in and resulted in my slight addiction are below

soundtrack and graphics  the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and chill af there were times i found myself working on my laptop with valheim running in the background just so i could listen to the calming melodies of the soundtrack and the soft crackle of the fireplace in my base the lighting and atmosphere are really top notch the low resolution style was almost a turnoff for me when researching this game and watching videos however once inside the valheim world i saw it is truly beautiful and worth experiencing 

discovery  the second thing that really drew me into valheim was this feature where once you pick up a new inventory item for the first time you will then discover crafting recipes associated to that item this as opposed to being awarded items for leveling up felt very enticing it made me want to explore to find new items and to push into more unforgiving lands for the rewards the items there may have this left me feeling like there was always something more out there to discover there are items in the game which currently have no function leaving some excitement to see what they are used for once that becomes available even after defeating the 5 current bosses and thinking i had complete the game there were 2 biomes i had never even seen and more items to discover 

development  the devs have a roadmap that is widely accessible and clear on their plans for the future of the game personally i have no social media accounts but even through steam they post development blogs to keep the community in the loop with their plans  to the prior point on discovery  after seeing what valheim has to offer now it is constantly changing even in the short 2 months i have had my hands on the game they have introduced a new enemy new armor set several qol updates they have nearfuture plans to add caves in the mountains and updates for the mistlands biome with farfuture plans for the ashlands and possibly others 

difficulty  the game is just hard enough like darksouls once you die there is a marker left at the location of your death where you must return to get your items however this didnt feel too punishing as you can have unlimited death markers with no time limit to recover them there were some times my items were stuck in a location that i couldnt immediately run there to recover them and knowing they werent lost forever was enough to keep me from getting overly frustrated by death furthermore the amount of resources obtained from a source vs the resources used in crafting felt very encouraging to building for one tree you get 10 wood which is enough to build 5 walls 


11 resource return  when dismantling a structure the game returns the full resources used to build it this means assuming you had room in your inventory you can demolish a base and rebuild it somewhere else without any additional grind similar games i have played in this genre typically give only a partial return with valheim i felt much more free to try things and then just delete them if they didnt look right or work how i expected 

building   lastly after spending 200 hours in this world defeating every boss discovering and crafting every item and upgrading all current items to their highest tier i still spend time in this game because the building is fun and satisfying and easy chop one tree and you can build 5 walls clipping is easy and forgiving even round walls and roofs look great once constructed and spoiler alert the devs make it very easy to cheat and enable debug mode this allows the user to fly which makes gathering resources for building awesome structures much easier they even permit using this in official building competitions 

all in all great experience highly recommend 


#####

has more game play less bugs and is polished better than most aaa games while still being in early access i would pay 40 for this game keep up the good work devs my life is consumed by this game i dont remember the last time a game kept me up late couldnt fall asleep because i was thinking what i would do the next day and get all my irl s done for the day so i have plenty of time to play later on i wish i could hug you and thank you in person for giving me back my love of video games which has been gone for some time

#####

i never thought id see the day where 6 viking warriors resurrected to fight for odins honor would all die from a single mosquito we had to sit around the campfire and come up with a strategy for literal bugs

1010 would lose dignity again

side note please dont look up guides on this game its so much more enjoyable exploring and learning on your own have fun

h1 odin wont let me go outside anymore and i have stockholm syndrome h1


early in the year 2021 i heard about this game a decent amount of people were talking about valheim

it appeared to be some sort of survival craft  sandbox title taking place in a norse mythology setting and since i love both i thought to myself hey lets give this a try

several months later im unable to tell if that grunt i just heard came from some creature in the game or my own stomach because of the pasta i ate raw in order to minimize the time spent on something else than building slaying monsters and gathering materials
social interactions are a distant memory time is irrelevant and i could swear the other day my cat attempted to speak norwegian while sporting a fake beard in order to try and get my attention

now allow me to at least try to explain to you why you should drop everything and make valheim your new and only religion


b the games not good its u amazing u b

at the time im writing this i valheim i is still in early access this is something i genuinely have to regularly remind myself because so far it actually feels like a finished product

in my 900 hours of play time  strike shut up strike  i could count on a single hands digits the times ive run into bugs and all of them were minor things that a simple log out log back in immediately fixed with no consequence whatsoever

from gameplay to graphics every aspect of the game is so polished that when you take into consideration the fact that this is a work in progress made by a small team of indie developpers its enough to put some of the biggest names in the industry through such amounts of shame that theyd wish they were activision blizzard right now


b ok but what is this game about b

basically i valheim i is some sort of cross between survival craft adventure and sandbox set in an open world

the pretty huge map is comprised of several different biomes youll have to explore in order to find crafting and building materials fight monsters and eventually face bosses it is procedurally generated at world creation which means that no two maps will look the same thus contributing to a unique experience

progression is based on the improvement of your gear through crafting which requires materials youll get from various sources in the world some of which youll only have access to after defeating bosses
recipes are unlocked either by putting said materials into your inventory or interacting with crafting stations for the first time this means that if you join a world in which the other players have already defeated bosses and stored materials breaking into their homes and rummaging through the crap theyve been hoarding like a real viking should allow you to catch up on their progression without having to do the exploring and fighting yourself and possibly ruin your experience in the process as well as earning yourself the title of lazy bastard

to help you achieve your goals you have a system of skills which are improved through pure practice for example the more you sprint the higher your sprinting skill value gets which progressively allows you to sprint for longer while using less stamina
in other words practice leads to efficiency


b sounds nice but whats so special about it b

if youve played other open world survival craft games before like i ark survival evolved i or i conan exiles i which are pretty damn good in their own right you might notice some similarities with valheim in terms of mechanics and gameplay
what i valheim i does that others dont in that regard is either improving on or getting rid of these elements that happen to mostly cause rectal discomfort in other games from the genre

ever spent four hours farming the stone required to build the three missing walls from your crappy shack in hope of preventing your untimely death from pneumonia caused by a sudden summer breeze only to be on your way home and suddenly die of dehydration because more than three minutes have passed since the last time you drank
and then you spent two more hours just running to your corpse on the other side of the continent dying 475 more times in the process because some local flock of seagulls have deemed you the perfect sacrifice to their dark god
but when you finally managed to reach the location of your body you only found undisturbed dust and sand as even the scorching sun seemed to laugh at your absolute despair

no such tragedy in i valheim i

although you can and will die in the welcoming embrace of your friendly neighborhood wildlife the game is designed in such a way that most of the frustration youll experience could only be blamed on your own lack of foresight

examples of this would be the following

 u you cannot die of hunger or thirst although eating is necessary to increase your health and stamina in order to survive encounters with monsters or sudden falls from steep cliffs u

 u the amounts of materials required for crafting and building can be gathered without necessiting to quit your job and survive on potatoes bought on the internet with healthcare money u

 u weather only affects your health and stamina regeneration rate except if you plan on climbing snowcovered mountains in your birthday suit but im no one to judge weve all tried this irl at least once u

 u player corpses have no time limit and will never disappear even after a server restart u

 u as long as theres four walls and a roof around them beds can be placed anywhere and the last one you interacted with will act as your next respawn location until you manually disable it u

now dont get me wrong the game absolutely does not lack anything in terms of challenge and at times you may potentially suffer flashbacks from that time you tried i dark souls i while drunk with your neighbors newborn baby howling like a tasmanyan devil in the background


b have you considered seeing a therapist b

dont need to dont want to

plus i dont have to do anything you tell me to since youre not even my real mom


b sounds a bit too perfect there must be at least some downsides b

there are but as surprising or dubious as it may seem there arent many in my humble opinion

 u technical optimisation isnt the best as of yet im more specifically thinking about the fact that being in an area with several playermade structures can cause severe framerate drops even on decent computers this can go to the point of unplayable on lowerend computers as it happened to one of my chums who eventually stopped playing for now because of it
hopefully it will be fixed with an upcoming update u

 u the damage dealt to structures by some highertier creatures just feels like the equivalent of card castles in a room full of chimps with adhd u

 strike used to rant about autopickup here turns out im just blind strike

keep in mind however that the game is still in early access at the time im posting this review


b final words b

somewhere inbetween thrilling and relaxing i valheim i is a very wellbalanced game made with love and passion and it really shows
the ability to alter the terrain by digging  flattening  raising the ground is pretty dope

regardless of what you think about the retroish style of the graphics this game is u gorgeous u youll know what i mean

from the very first time i got ganged up on by a group of monsters while peacefully picking berries to when i took a sip of mead as i watched the horizon from the top of my fortress decorated with the heads of their brethren i enjoyed every second of this journey im still far from being done with

if you are tempted just buy the game i promise you wont regret it

this is hardly a game although it provides massive pleasure  it is more of an experience one that is as highly addictive as  it is fun to play   beware that you can spend hundreds even thousands of very satisfying hours playing the game  theres lots to learn yet no book of rules no specific  pathways to take etc etc   

at my fine old age of 72 i have been playing pc games for longer than most of you have been alive   the first pc adventurestyle games consisted entirely of words on a  screen and a choice of a few actions   this game is at the extreme in terms of being virtually boundless   only your creativity or lack of it will hold you back   

for me  valheim is the perfect blend of exploration building skill development resource development survival and fps   



#####

i am very impressed with this game  its worth far more than 20

it fills the following niches

 open world  my god its huuuuuuuuuuuuuge
 crafting  huge crafting tree with tiers of upgrades
 building you can build some very impressive homes castles towns etc
 survival oh yes  food health temperature shelter
 loregameplay  significant effort put into crafting a unique yet familiar worl
 social gameplay  up to 10 fellow gamers  open locked and public worlds


 log into any world you want to at any time with any of your characters and carry stuff between worlds
 use a world as a home base while hunting gathering fight in in other worlds
 up to 10 friends can coop play with you  you can join their worlds they yours  carry stuff between

i was hooked almost from the beginning  your clumsy character makes you think the game is clumsy no you are just a noob and need to train up  get to work make an axe and then hunt down everything in sight

you can make a world and keep it just to live on and even lock yourself in the center of a castle and when you want to play the game go into any world you want to or make a new one gather stuff there complete your store there and use your home world as a storehouse and life raft  you can logout at any time and what you do in one world can be carried to the next both as items and as experience

its been a long time since i was impressed enough to say the following about a game

youd be a fool to pass this game up

buy it now

#####

im an older gentlemen with kids who watch those kids play minecraft and think why i play wow pubg call of duty i usually have a bare minimum to my visual graphicsaestheticsart styles

i bought valheim for both myself and my wife off the recommendation from a coworker one i wouldnt typically take gaming advice from normally id watch it played on twitch or watch some kind of gameplay video i never buy a game blind i dont know what possessed me to do that with valheim but i did 

we loaded up character select and i went to create a character and i saw the visuals of my avatar i looked at my wife and said lets start that 2 hour timer cause steam wont refund if youve played longer than 2 hours

our first session was 12 hours and we played most of the next day as well were pushing 450500 hours played bought it for both our kids and have a world that we play with them separate from our main one i lose entire days to building projects 

eventually youll feel like youve run out of stuff to do especially if you race to the finish of the bosses im anxiously awaiting the first big update 

gotten 10x my moneys worth yes its a bit grindy but other than the farming it doesnt feel like chores i like that everything you need is crafted youre not held back by the rng of creature drops you know what you need and you go get it

#####

valheim provides an excellent creative outlet you get to explore craft build and play your way in a visually pleasing environment in addition it is an excellent platform for playing with a group of friends i cant think of any other game that accomplishes all of these things so harmoniously it does this while occupying less than 2 gigs of storage space on your computer

i will add that the pace of development has been dreadfully slow a little slow compared to the typical development speed of similar games and catastrophically slow compared to the developers original ambitions

all told i have to recommend this game given all of the entertainment it provided me there are a couple caveats to my recommendation the first is that you should wait to play it the development is slow and i think most people will be done playing the game before they ever see meaningful new content the second is that you should definitely play with a group of friends it is a big lonely world if you are the only viking on the map thank you to whoever reads my review and happy gaming

edit 

id like to conclude that i no longer think you should wait to play valheim in its current state there is enough content to make this game worth every penny

#####

this game is great if you go in blind do not read the wiki do not ask anyone how to do something play and discover as you go i cannot stress it enough just play

#####

valheim is currently extremely popular for a reason while i dont think its perfect it does a lot of things right that other survival games dont its surprisingly well thoughtthrough with many elaborate systems in place which make a lot of sense in the context of a survival setting valheim is a single or online multiplayer coop survival game that combines elements from minecraft rust souls like games and even elder scrolls and adds a lot on top of it to round out everything into one game which makes it feel whole and well designed it constantly makes you think about how you want to approach each of the games aspects whether its building combat or exploration

your main progression goal is to defeat the games forsaken bosses which in turn not only give you new items to progress with but also grant you their power these powers come in form of an unlimited use but long cooldown aoebuffs unlike many other survival games youre not only progressing through your equipment but also directly with your character as almost all ingame actions correspond to a skill that you can level up by simply doing it a lot you need to be careful though as deaths become increasingly punishing because they will set you back a percentage of your skill progression and drop all your items in the place you died in this skill system feels really good in my opinion because it offers room for everyone ranging from generalist to specialist and anything in between you might want to be the sword and shield wielding heavy armor type of player or you might want to be the sneaky backstabber or even the swift archer all of these playstyles work but neither of them will be ideal for all the situations the game will throw you into whichever you choose so far ive never felt like i had chosen the wrong way to play where progression seems completely impossible without putting more time into leveling up some other skill furthermore youre never required to reach a certain skill level to do a specific thing youre only ever getting better at doing it by leveling up your skills

the base or home building game is another aspect of the game that i think the game does really well while the game offers you the ability to build strictly grid based you can build nearly anything however you like should the grid as well as the half size options not fit your needs the game also actively rewards you for a lot of the furniture and decorations you can build by increasing the comfortlevel of your housing basically higher comfort will give you a longer lasting buff when you rest inside as you gather more materials you will unlock more crafting recipes which will make sure youre never overwhelmed with too many options all at once when building a house youll find that youll have to keep a lot of things in mind first of all structural integrity is not a given hover over your building pieces with your building hammer to see how stable your structure is if it goes too far into the red it will break unless you build additional pillars or walls for support other stuff to worry about include the rain putting out your fires and the smoke of fires hurting you if you let it build up in your home so plan your house to keep stuff like this in mind as you learn more if youre the type who would rather shape your surroundings to your likings instead of adjusting your buildings according to them the game also offers terraforming options for that so digging a moat or raising your foundation high above everything else is an option

exploration in the game feels great there are a lot of biomes to see and the landscapes are beautiful there is never a shortage of new things to see although some biomes are by design harder to survive in than others so dont wander into new territory carelessly the game will usually intuitively let you know where you should look for progress next either through item naming for instance if you get a swamp key that means you can go look for a swamp or through the tutorial bird who always shows up when you discover something new that isnt self explanatory be aware though that building a base in a more dangerous area than the starting one will definitely require you to defend it against foes either through fighting or through clever base design

lastly the combat in this game its mostly inspired by souls like games with stamina blocking and dodging all playing an important part what i like here is that this plays very well together with the skill system in the game as you will find that certain types of enemies take increased damage from certain types of damage ie blunt weapons slashing weapons piercing weapons so leveling up your sword and spear skill could potentially help you in some areas while leveling up only one will result in the maximum damage from that type of weapon some enemies will be easier to block while for others youll want to dodge their attacks and some are just better dealt with at range generally id say the combat in the game is fun although sometimes it gets frustrating to run out of stamina frequently

generally the game felt the best to me when i saw how well the different aspects of the game work together crafting building gathering fighting exploring looting they all go hand in hand with each other for instance when youre crafting your armor youll find that you can upgrade it with additional material but it also requires a higher level workbench which youll get if you built your home with one or more of the workbench improvements near the workbench you want to gather a lot of wood or stone you might want to make a cart to drag it behind you and carry a lot more but first youll probably also want to have a path so that the cart doesnt get stuck on every rock or bush theres a river in the way build a bridge but make sure its stable enough and while youre at it maybe give it a roof as well so its safe from the rain later you might want to come back and build a better bridge from stone and make a paved road for what might now be an important travel route for you and transporting stuff will always stay relevant even if you get better methods of transportation a little into the game so planning for some means of moving stuff around will definitely pay off

heres a couple things i didnt like about the game firstly the stamina system generally works really well and the higher you level your skills the less stamina your actions will drain however there are a ton of ways the game can make you regain stamina more slowly though debuffs like cold at night or wet during the rain and sometimes it feels slow and frustrating to have very limited actions available simply because of circumstances that you could technically work around but more often than not simply end up having to accept also in multiplayer when youll want to equip like 46 people with the latest and upgraded equipment it can take a long time to acquire enough materials especially if youre just playing casually or if you dont plan properly personally ive run into some bugs that ended up costing me a fair amount of progress however from what i can tell that bug has been fixed since you should still expect to run into bugs every now and then and the game server can be laggy sometimes some enemies are also hard to deal with without proper precautions and knowledge which i personally think is okay but i know it will cause frustration to some

if you like survival games in general and have a couple friends to play with definitely give valheim a try if you liked rust but disliked how easily you can lose all your progress to pvp valheim got you covered if you feel like a mix between minecraft and elder scrolls could be fun thats also a strong indication youll probably like the game at about 20 bucks id say the game is definitely worth the asking price


#####

imagine if rust and runescape had a baby without the pvp 

you wouldnt think its early access we had zero bugs there was about 6 of us and we havent had this much fun in a game together in years the depth of the crafting building and the world itself is unreal 

i dont often review but this game is outstanding  truly worth your money 

edit i really didnt expect this to blow up like this thanks for all your kind words and awards this is the first time anything like this has happened  

to answer a few queries 

1 no i didnt get paid sorry i havent reviewed every product on my account  i took the time to review this because i genuinely had so much fun and it filled a gaming need ive had for the longest time 

it gave me a feeling of old school runescape plus the building and crafting sense of progression of rust 

the reason why i reviewed is because its an early access game i want the developers and community to know that personally enjoyed it and show a token of support 

2 i am aware there is pvp but what i meant was that the progress on the game wasnt geared towards pvp  which is a love hate relationship i had with rust

#####

it feels like playing minecraft again for the first time

#####

been playing for a while now restarted from scratch 3 x and  worked upto and beat 5th boss each time best game i have ever played in my 62 years  ive built some interesting structures in my time playing the game  theres tons to keep you busy  its been great fun  i am now trying my best to venture into and conquer mistlands  its tough but fun i have only ever played solo and had no problems whith advancing in the game alone  so far  i totally recommend this game and am surprised it costs so little compared to other games out 
there plus they keep adding to it 

#####

cant quite put my finger on why this game is so captivating it has the mesmerising  graphics of among trees a brilliant soundtrack you dont get bored with and a nice easy progression to some really brutal combat they just seem to have found that magic combination sure it is a little clunky in places but its really early access and im sure in time the devs will sort everthing out and we will have a new half life on our hands i love the building and crafting the devs have really got this bit nailed by the way im 62 and my wife is 67 and we are both hooked my battle maiden has her own copy well done iron gate keep the quality coming

#####

very good game but certainly not for everyone

valheim is a survival rpg with a primary focus on crafting elements   

to say it has a lot of grind is an understatement  you will be spending most of your time gathering resources even if you make your base a minimalist design   not everyone will like this  some will hate it and some will love it

the enemies in more dangerous areas are very punishing and you will find yourself spending days preparing to face them and the loss of your equipment if you die will result in you grinding more to be able to recover it  fortunately you can recover it

this however has an effect that when get to the point you can easily defeat enemies you had to run cowardly from before you feel a real sense of achievement 

the sailing system is rather well done although the ships do behave like triangle sail ships not square sail ships  still that is a choice of style over accuracy   a triangle sale ship wouldnt look right for the era but a triangle sale ships behavior is better for gameplay

as of the technical aspects the game is still under heavy development and it is clearly not fully optimized  it is feature complete now as of having full gameplay and a good number of bosses implemented

performance isnt the best but most people can run maximum view distance so long as they dont max out the other settings  max quality lighting seems to hit hard on even high performance hardware

#####

valheim really nails a lot of things that the survival genre sometimes struggles with

the sandbox gameplay that never rushes you is balanced with a meaningful progression system that keeps you fixed on certain goals and milestones

acquiring and consuming better food makes you more capable in combat and exploration but you will never simply drop dead due to hunger making sustenance feel more like a reward than a nagging requirement

the building system is rewarding  your shelters must be constructed with adequate support and ventilation of smoke in mind and interior comforts increase the amount of rest you gain incentivizing you to not just build a house but a nice house

you can construct paired portals to fast travel across the map but certain raw materials cannot be carried through them which creates interesting logistical choices between shipping materials over long distances by cart or by boat and building outposts to process and craft your materials closer to where they are mined  additionally certain crops can only grow in certain biomes which further incentivizes setting up multiple bases  thankfully the rewarding nature of the building system makes the prospect of building a new base an opportunity rather than a burden

like most games in this genre a good amount of time is spent gathering resources but the amount you need never seems onerous  it can be time consuming but this is often because you will get interrupted by monsters drawn to the sound of mining ore and chopping trees which breaks up what could otherwise be a monotonous task

and lastly the games unique graphical style is gorgeous  low polygon counts and simple textures free up resources that are spent on beautiful lighting atmospherics and color composition

this type of openworld survivalbuilding game isnt for everyone  its heavy on atmosphere but light on story and there are some routine repetitive tasks involved  but if youve ever enjoyed another game in this genre or are curious and looking for one to start on valheim strikes an amazing balance that accentuates the genres strengths while minimizing its inherent flaws

h1valheimh1
is an openworld crafting survival game sent by odin to the world of valheim you must survive by gathering resources building a shelter training your skills and crafting equipment to fight the forsaken

h1 ugame description  mechanicsu h1
as with most crafting survival everything you eat wear or build is made of various materials and using various tools made from those materials you start by gathering branches and rocks from the ground crafting your first axe hammer and weapon which in turn will allow you to gather better stronger and more varied material found in areas of increasing difficulty with each material you find for the first time new recipes are revealed from your character remembering their mortal life

progress is unlocked through defeating bosses for instance spoilerdefeating eikthyr will give you hard antlers from which to craft your first pickaxe which in turns will allow you to start gathering your first metal orespoiler the game is also separated in areas known as biomes and it is implied that you avoid biomes beyond your level you start in meadows where you will find the first boss after which you can go in black forests where you will find the second boss and so forth there is no physical barrier to those biomes beyond the difficulty of the creatures found within and you should have maxed out your equipment made from material available in your current biome before exploring the next more difficult biomes

your stats consists of health and stamina which have no permanent increase the food you eat will increase those base stats temporarily increase which will steadily decline over time you are limited to eating three things at any given time which must be different you may eat raspberries mushrooms and cooked meat but not three cooked meats you will eventually unlock potion crafting made from fermented mead giving buffs to poison or cold resistance or filling your health or stamina

h1 uwhat i enjoyedu h1
i must say this game can be pretty laid back ive read that it incorporates all the strengths of crafting survival games but none of the weaknesses and it is pretty much the case if you dont eat your health and stamina will be pretty low you wont regenerate your health and will only slowly regain stamina but you wont die of hunger if you want to spend days gathering wood and rocks and building your dream longhouse then you may ignore eating completely the same applies to sleeping being dry or staying warm except for the freezing temperature of mountain biomes that is your stamina wont regenerate as fast but you can otherwise ignore it if youre not heading into danger

but the game is still punishing where it needs to be if youre cutting down trees and stick around when the trunk is falling towards you youll die if youre climbing on very high rooftops to finish your chimney and fall youll die if you explore swamps without poisonresistance potions or mountains without coldresistance potions youll die and have no one but yourself to blame and when you do die your skills are decreased by 5 and you lose all your inventory and equipment until you can go back to that location to recover it

screenshots wont do it justice the game uses lighting fog and weather effects in a superb manner one morning youll be welcomed to a gorgeous sunrise the next will surround the area in a fog so thick you can barely see an arms length in front of you and the next will have windy showers and thunderstorms it is quite effective at setting the mood but it will also affect your playthrough when it rains youre wet you dont recover stamina as fast when its windy your boat will get damaged from crashing into high waves

h1 uwhat bothered meu h1
while it seems like a good idea to have your crafting progress determined by the bosses the implications regarding difficulty goes beyond that there are events of increasing frequency where your location or base gets attacked and the difficulty of those events is determined by which boss youve defeated regardless of how safe is the biome youve settled in having boars and necks attack your wooden walls is barely a bother at first but when multiple trolls are smashing through your stone walls while you just wanted peace and quiet to create a new architectural monument it gets annoying

visuals are pretty but polygons and resolutions are oldgen looking reminiscent of late ps1early ps2 graphics if console gamers want something to compare of course this is an early access title so a stable game with solid and fun gameplay is more important at this stage but i sure hope this gets taken into consideration further down the development line

another thing the game lacks is a high quantity of craftable items decorations are few so constructing a believable mead hall or village is difficult within the confines of the available pieces the hearth and home update recently delayed further to later this year cannot come soon enough

h1bmy early access verdictb   iwhy wait any longerih1

ivalheimi deserves the highest rating i can give an early access game i had a lot of fun playing it especially when a friend established a server for a few of us to hop in and out at our own pace building and exploring together since release its been patched to a very stable and bugfree experience more updates are on their way slowed down by the extremely high quantity of players giving feedback yet the included content is already enough to have plenty of fun theres no need to wait for it to come out of early access you can go right ahead and get this one

i really like valheim i have ran a server and played with my adult children for hours  months  we have built entire villages castles and ports we have waited for so long for the mist lands updates and sadly moved on to different games

#####

accidentally played for 12 hours straight going to make some dinner now its good

#####

start as a viking end up as bob the builder
great game

#####

i just finished beating the first boss these are my initial thoughts and the mechanics used in the game  

valheim is like a minecraft version of dark souls with fallout buildingsurvival 

mechanics

you gather resources and use a work bench to craft shelter weapons and armor

the tools weapons and armor wear down with use but can be repaired at the work bench 

the building of structures snaps together pretty well but sometimes the piece disappears until its in the right spot 

you attack run sneak block and dodge with a stamina meter 

you sleep in a bed to set your respawn point sleeping turns night into day and you get a temporary bonus for sleeping 

you cook food at a fire when you eat you regenerate health rainy and cold weather debuffs you these survival aspects makes you think a little more but is not a chore

there are no experience points but there are skill levels you get higher skill levels by doing those actions eg run skill goes up when you run 

when you die you leave behind a tombstone with all your gear you have to go back to the place where you died to reclaim your gear once i died and looted all but one thing i then died again a second tomb stone was made i was still able to go back and loot that one thing from the first tombstone 

thoughts  play experience  tips

as soon as i landed i was attacked by four different types of enemies in sequential order while i was naked and bare handed that let me know what i was in for 

the trees are out to get you when you chop them down run away you have been warned 

watch your cooking food just like you would in real life 

mark all the shelter you come across on the map in case of bad weather 

the first boss fight was done well 

i played using the keyboard and mouse but im thinking my xbox controller may be the way to go 

the viking flavor of the game is subtle in some aspects praise the tree

#####

day 1 odin says im not allowed into valhalla until i kill his enemies in this limborealm on yggdrasil his big tiddy goth waifu crowwoman valkyrie carries me here but neglects to give me any weapons or clothes she left its raining i am unhappy

let me say this right off the bat if you enjoy buildingsurvival games just buy it if you have friends who enjoy it buy the game and purchase a server also take a few days off work you wont regret it ok lets talk about it now

graphics believe me they are better than you think they just are dont look at screens dont mind low poly textures but enjoy a meager 1gb download for the game dont worry about anything the game is gorgeous

now that we talked about it should i tell you about how awesome and immersive the feeling of exploration and adventure is like how you look around trying to see in the dark and take out a torch or how you see a troll notsodistant in the fog and freak out

or like the game being low fantasy so requiring good effort and how you start an expedition not knowing what youll face and where set up a camp run from enemies or challenge them find new loot mark resources

maybe we should talk about the joy of settling down in a village building with the just enough amount of realism working together on tasks building up resources

or we can just talk about cool viking stuff all the weapons you can forge enemies you can kill ships you build and sail with

whatever i tell you it wont do the game justice even after its fresh release in ea valheim is one of the best games of its type for me its terrariauo7dtd in the best way possible for you it may be something else 

play it then let me know what you think in a comment

edit im at 120 hours right now after a week and ive only loved the game more for anyone commentingreading comments here are a few remarks

graphics yes the graphics are low poly but its stylized similar to world of warcraft more importantly unlike wow it has really good effects so if you want to see a detailed face you arent getting it but when you look at nature the sun rising how a storm feels how the light plays out under rain etc its incredibly beatiful i didnt say the graphics were cutting edge i said its gorgeous and i stand by it ill upload some screenshots after this edit feel free to check them out but again  screens dont do it justice because the organic feeling can only be felt when the trees are moving the waves are rising the rain pours etc

server as clarified you do not need a server what i meant was that we took such an instant liking to a game we wanted to play it under best circumstances i also need to add that i play with 3 friends and in total we are spread to 3 cities in 2 countries plus dedicated server allows anyone to connect to the game world at any time they want this is the same with games like terraria etc not a requirement just a big convenience
for terraria i had used gameservers but i couldnt find it there maybe they added since so i used gportal as also promoted by devs

uo it does mean ultima online going out to nature mining cutting lumber coming back to smelt and craft and being sandbox is what makes me think of it obviously there are many games like it nowadays but i encountered this stuff first time in uo personally

#####

i was the worlds bravest and strongest warrior until some mosquito kicked my ass

#####

great game but if you die an hour via boat away from a spawn point be ready for the most tilting experience of your life

#####

let me start out by saying 
if youre intimidated by early access dont be in this case this game puts aaa studios to shame seriously

im 25 last night my two friends and i also 25 stayed up until 7am playing this game we all have jobs and two of us are in school and have homework due today that we havent started we are normally very responsible this game is f god tier 

i havent even begun to scratch the surface on the amount of things you can do and i have 50 hours into this game theres literally too much to tell you about it the best description ive heard is if terraria skyrim and dark souls had a baby itd be this game 

thats basically it except i like to say its more similar to minecraft 

theres literally endless possibilities for you as a solo player or a crew while roleplaying is not required its inherent to the game and the atmosphere and youll come across all sorts of people who are enjoying themselves and would like to rest by your hearth to gain some buffs before continuing their adventure 

let me try and tell you some of the reasons i love this game  know ill never be done explaining  and i dont even know it all myself

 procedural map no same experience
 ocean exploration new continentsislands and biomes being found constantly the more youre willing to venture into the sea be wary there may or may not be monsters waiting to swallow your little raft
 extremely intuitive building ever played rust its like that except 10x better building snapping works really well pieces can be clipping and instead of the game screaming at you it understands and allows you to make seamless additions
 manipulation of the very land you stand on you can level ground raise ground pickaxe into the dirt and make holes to hide things pickaxe into the mountains cant tunnel yet though make paths etc 
 did i say the ocean its beautiful its scary youre a f viking there are parts of the game dungeons you need to clear to progress at a certain point the starter continent on multiplayer worlds will have had their dungeons cleared already this things do not respawn forcing you to venture into the deep blue sea and find your wealth elsewhere 
 monsters monsters based on biomes monsters you wouldnt even think of 

side note
as im sitting here writing this review we got a special event where two trolls decided to come rail us in the dark crevice and destroy our walls and attack our base 


guys im leaving so much out im just saying this game is so worth the money and you seriously will not regret purchasing it

#####

this game is great really great the first 4 days that i started playing my sleep schedule got completely twisted
it looks good the combat is fun even though its an early access it feels pretty complete and i havent encountered a single glitch not even minor
but the problem is after defeating all the bosses the game suddenly starts to feel empty everywhere you go looks pretty much the same its like the whole environment is just to supply you with the materials you need for the gear required to defeat the boss its like the world isnt there to explore and find new things
the ocean is boring the only thing that will make you keep an eye on the screen is the direction of the windevery dungeon has the same loot and enemies so does every crypt and biome to a point that when you see a new dungeon or troll cave you wont even consider entering it to explore it because you already know what exactly is in there
yeah suddenly the new stuff that got you excited are no longer there the devs have to and are in fact working on it and the game has the potential to be an extremely popular game for at least another 2 years but the devs have to keep the content coming
overall great experience

#####

i have never been so addicted to a game  i caution others  the format of this game survival with the adventure creates a self directed and self paced enjoyment  i have attempted to move through very slow after the first 3 bosses  i didnt want it to end  i get side tracked for days  weeks on exploring and basic survival 
i have barely started building as other have done  the crafting is a little weaker then when playing a game poe or grim dawn but many compare it to minecraft  ive never played minecraft so i dont know
what i cannot believe is this is early access  there is more to come and ive already spent 1130 real life hours playing this game
i can honestly say this is the most value i have ever gotten out of a purchase ever

given the opportunity everything will kill you

found beach built nice hut on beach storm started started storm watching 

tsunami came no more hut

gg

#####

gameplay

i spent 
 300h chopping wood
 80h building storage for more wood
 3h grinding ressources to upgrade my axe to chop wood more efficiently

enemy design
 there are small trees which can be defeated in a bare knuckle fight
 regular trees which require at least a stone axe to be killed
 boss trees can be taken down if you come prepared by bringing a better axe

conclusion need more wood

#####

i only have 2 big problems with the game is its been 2 years with no extensive content updates and the discord mods are a bunch of losers

#####

my name be hjalmar i craft an axe
i smack the tree i smoke a rack
dwellers come to steal me sacks
of gold and plunder cannot give back 
first they strong i run i shy
but then i cook from steel and hide 
hjalmar strong now kingdom thrive
hjalmar stronger 
now kingdom mine

#####

lets get one thing straight this game is incredible even with its clunky ui made much better with mod support and terrible multiplayer support ive never been so engrossed in an open world survival game this truly is inspiring to every indie studio out there on what true vision for a game can get you

however

valheim has sold over 12 million copies at the time of this review

lets assume they sold those at an average of 15 each

thats about 180000000

lets also assume that valve and coffee stain the publisher take roughly half

that still leaves them with 90 million dollars i understand this is complete conjecture and not all substantiated but im upset so let me do this

90000000 for a team of somewhere between 1150 employees according to their linkedin page is an unimaginable number reminder that they also started with 5 employees

im left here wondering where did all that money go because the game is obviously not finished there are so many things left incomplete and broken i cant tell you how many times ive restarted this game only to find that there is still the same amount of content and fixes that there was a year ago even their new updates come out broken and unplayable ive resorted to playing the game with the many many mods available to fix and add to the game where the developers seemingly cannot

it is astounding to me how something can be in early access for so long and have so little to show for it

so please iron gate after youve had your well deserved post release break i would expect at least some marginal progress towards a 10 launch

thanks for no micro transactions though

#####

this is simply put what i always wanted minecraft to be i played mc on and off for over ten years and generally you get over that sense of impending danger and bases built with teamwork dont feel that fulfilling 

valheim fixes all that real physics real combat real skill levelling use it to improve it real teamwork but most importantly real danger

i love it

i chopped tree tree chopped back

#####

1 tell your friends about the game nobody is interested
2 argue why everyone should buy it everyone disagrees
3 after a long persuasion everyone reluctantly agrees to buy the game 
4 start the game and play together for couple of hours be unable to continue your friends continue anyway
5 come back after couple of days the village has been built and the first two bosses has been slain
6 follow your friends as they manically introduce all their new gear and weapons fake laugh alongside your friends play couple hours and tell them you will have more time to play in weekend disconnect from the server 
7 come back again in friday check your friends steam profiles see that they have played valheim for over 100 hours during the last week 
8 enter the server the whole kingdom with taverns castles and stonewalls has been built only the final boss is remaining to be slain admire your friends new attire glimmering swords and golden capes listen to your friends when they guide you to how to skip the entire game to get the best gear available find your personal corner with your bed and crappy gear turned to a storage room the only house you previously built is used as a pen for breeding boars fake laugh again alongside your friends 
9 follow your friends as they leave the base to gather materials encounter the first low level mob that kills you due to your low level and poor gear resurrect and spin around the base without any purpose for couple hours quit the game when your friends are still on their voyage
10 next morning check your whatsapp where your friends boast on the group chat how they have slayed the final boss and finished the game nobody is interested to play it anymore uninstall the game for good 
55 great experience


#####

i played 88 hours during the first 15 hours of the early access

i died to trees falling
i died to boars eating my face
i died to skeletons eating my face
i died to tiny lizards called necks eating my lower body
i got my face absolutely punched in by a giantgoblinshaman creature

i helped gather supplies to build a base
i helped build a decent base
i helped scout a potential location upgrade for a base on a huge map
i helped destroy the base
i helped carry the supplies from the old base to a new area
i helped build a new base
i helped build a better base
i helped build rafts to explore even further

i did not crash not even once even though its the first day of early access
i did not come across any gamebreaking bugs  even though its the first day of early access
i did not die to any of the normal silly goblin creatures  they certainly tried their best though

after only killing one of the multiple boss creatures you summon and clearing one delve full of skeletons and ghosts it feels like ive barely scratched the surface  since its probably too late to get a refund guess ill have to play again tomorrow

edit 2621

30 hours in and this game is still kicking my teeth in but im also having a lot of fun  cant speak much from the solo player perspective but with a few friends this game absolutely delivers  im still super impressed by the quality and volume of content this game has while in early access

#####

i cant believe how much i love this game  

i began playing valheim in may 2021 and i planned to wait until i reached the late game stage before writing a review because ive been disappointed by other early access games one of which had plenty of early game content but no late game to speak of for the entire time i gave it a chance  a full year after its fourth year in ea already

anyhow i became obsessed with valheim immediately and decided to write this review after playing more than 200 fantastic hours in one month  i am so impressed by many things in the game  its incredibly engaging and provides a great deal of fun besides defeating bosses and winning the game  i feel the various stages of the game  as you progress through those boss battles  are very well balanced  you can feel like your character is badass and is able to easily wipe out the enemies in the early biomes and then the next biome is challenging again for you  i hope the biomes and later stages of the game that i havent reached yet are just as well balanced

i have only battled the first two bosses because i enjoy all the other activities in the game so much and am taking my time in them  building in the game is especially rewarding and ive built many scouting bases as well as large elaborate bases  ive also reclaimed abandoned structures and farms that weve discovered in convenient locations  i look forward to finding a village and restoring it in the future and i have plans for a castle to build when ive reached the late game stage

exploration is extremely rewarding and the world is massive  theres so much to see that ill probably explore the entire map before facing the final boss

i love the graphics and art style of the game  its a blend of modern graphics and old school rpg elements  i was immediately immersed in the game because of those familiar looks and it made me get into role playing as a viking as soon as i arrived in the strange realm that odin exiled his enemies to  

the setting is amazing and i enjoy encountering outlandish beasts with complete suspension of disbelief  one night in the game i witnessed a dark apparition in the distance and cautiously approached it  only to watch it vanish as i drew nearer  i later learned that it was odin maybe checking up on my progress fighting his enemies or perhaps to inspire my conviction to do his will  i look forward to learning more about the lore of the game as its development continues

i like that you can play the game solo jump into a friends game hosted on their computer or join a multiplayer game on a server and use your existing characters across all those game experiences  you keep your skill progress and all the items in your inventory when you play your character in other games  you also have control over pvp and can turn it off if you dont want to fight with other players in multiplayer games

as an early access game i expect it to take at least another two years to be finished  the first major update was recently delayed until the autumn which i find encouraging to be honest  it shows me the devs arent going to rush and put out broken updates just to keep up with an optimistic road map of planned feature updates  my hope is that the game will continue getting better as it reaches the end of the ea phase while providing a smooth and enjoyable experience for the existing player base  i dont like to be forced into starting a new game every time there is a major update to a game  i understand that it can be necessary sometimes but i hope valheim will not go through this cycle during its final years in development

i absolutely recommend this game to all players who enjoy survival games and building unique structures  there is so much to do see and love in the game already  if youre comfortable trying out games in early access you should definitely try valheim  its definitely one of the best survival games ive played

#####

there are so many things i want to say about valheim but ill keep it short

as i suspect happened to most this game came out of nowhere for me a pvm experience perfectly suited for you and your gaming buddies to band together and tackle if your group is like ours we typically dive into a game together and get bored within the first few days but not this time

the strength of valheim is the dripfeed progression without ever slipping into tediousness i never have to spend significant amounts of time in valheim doing maintenance work or the like food doesnt spoil exposed wood never fully decays and anything you build can be refunded easily this translates into an experience where every minute spent adventuring is ground gained

im not sure how they iron gate did it but at release they nailed setting continuous clear goals for players which can be trusted to lead to meaningful progression once completed the gameplay loop is well defined  you adventure into a new slightly scarier biome slowly gain mastery over the elements within it and conclude with a satisfying boss fight

what an unexpected treat

#####

this game has no business being this f good



update did everything still f good

#####

wonderful game  would love to have some npcs to populate the towns ive been building

#####

first 5 minutes into the game i try chopping down my first tree after making my first axe tree fell on me i died

1010 would recommend

#####

the bees are happy

#####

valheim feels like the child of minecraft and runescape that has skyrim and dark souls as older siblings

#####

valheim is literally so fun but i have no friends to play with

#####

take note developers of other games this is how you do early access this could pass as a full game already compared to the trash you find out there now i have 40 hours in and i am at 3rd boss i could have rushed more like taking time wandering into other areas i have not unlocked stuff for yet means pretty solid death its a challenge and its fun i cant wait for them to add even more to this game but man it could be left like this and still worth every penny of the 20 they are asking good job guys

#####

viking do building
viking do farming
viking do hunting
viking do bee keeping
viking do exploring
viking do more building
viking do cooking
viking do animal husbandry
viking do boat ride
viking do fishing
viking do dream of valhalla 
viking do raid
viking get raided
viking do mead brewing
viking do more and more building
viking make home not house
viking happy

#####

you know whats really great about this game it never disappears up its own arse it does whats good whether its realistic or not food never goes off and you wont die of hunger but the building system has proper engineering mechanics to add depth and make building more intuitive its realistic where it matters 

and you know the other good thing about this game its the textbook example of what an early access game is supposed to be the content isnt complete but the content that is there is eminently playable and the bugs arent gamebreaking in fact in valheims case there are very few bugs full stop but you dont necessarily expect that in early access i certainly didnt expect it to be as good as it is 

the most casual brutal survival game on steam highly recommended

#####

bought the game thinking ill be a viking i ended up being a carpenter

#####

youre a viking you club lil gremlins and slay gods also gardening 1010 recommend

#####

i think ive been so engrossed with valheim and its development over the last three years that id forgotten to write a review to comprise my thoughts on just how good this game is what is pleasing to see is that so many people have written great reviews for this which makes it a bit harder for me to know where to start with mine 

as a captivating survival game it probably sits at the very top of all great survival games for starters the procedurally generated lofi purgatory inspired by norse mythology is beautifully rendered from dense forests to snowtopped mountains you have a plethora of biomes to explore the landscapes offer a sense of discovery and danger where players start as humble vikings tasked with gathering resources crafting tools and constructing shelters to survive the harsh wilderness fast forward hours and hours youll be delving deep into home raids magic encounters and ancient relics 

i love the sense of progression through biomes and technology the ability to pickup and sail wherever the wind may take you and naturally getting yourself into all sorts of trouble whether it be a lone journey or a camaraderiefuelled experience hitting over three hundred hours on this game has been effortless and had it not been for me playing a variety of games routinely id easily sink ithousandsi into this its that good 

one of the easiest modernday recommendations and the price point is a steal

i killed a 10 ft troll 

a mosquito killed me 



#####

i thought id be a viking instead i became a farmer and an architecht

#####

this game was great until i was exploring the plains and was killed by a mosquito then after i respawned two more mosquitos spawned in next to my basic little hut i made after crossing the sea one of the mosquitos managed to fly through a window and is now trapped in my house killing me every time i respawn if the mosquito trapped in my house wasnt bad enough there is one guarding the outside and one next to my body i tried to escape in my boat but after i threw it in third gear i got killed and boat sailed away 

the strategic genius of the mosquito squad is far too much for my relatively small brain to handle and if anyone has any tips on what to do it would be greatly appreciated

you like rust conan and other sandbox building games but hate being killed by a player at the same moment you spawn what about overly fast metabolism and starvation system how about drinking water every 10 seconds valheim has none of those it is down to earth hard but just casual enough to keep the new players and veterans of the genre on the edge of their seats

#####

how they fit all this into 1 gb

#####

im going to start out by saying that i normally loathe almost every system this game utilizes item durability survival food crafting minimal storylines all of it we hates it my preciousss but sir mixalot levels of but to follow this game puts it all together in a way that makes it far more than the sum of its parts i normally tell people that this game reminds me of minecraft meets vikings because thats the simplest analogy you craft your way up from the usual naked meatbag into being a flamingsword swinging steelclad wrecking ball your first house is probably going to be a pathetic wooden box behind whose walls youll huddle like a scared ball of uselessness but by the end youre living in a massive egostroking fortress of awesomeness and striding forth from its halls in fearless search of whatever baddy is too damn stupid to run screaming from the terror youve become longships sea serpents massive storms on land and sea no really the waves are ridiculous flying serpents the undead blobs because of course there are evil blobs and even giant leeches i guess the mind behind this game is a fan of the princess bride my friends and i have built more castles than a norman king killed more dragons than a library full of dragonlance novels and shot more seagulls than florida man could ever dream of the dropin coop is solid and makes an already good game great if you like viking games builder games or survival games then this game is a nobrainer buy it play it enjoy it just dont forget to craft some food before climbing on top of your ingame house in order to finish the roof because dying from falling off of your own roof is dumb it happens a lot seriously

#####

i love this game its a fun survival craft experience
my biggest gripe with it is its intended for playing in a group especially when fighting the bosses they take way to much punishment and can wipe you instantly i just hope in the coming updates when they happen bosses scale with the amount of players so solos like me can have more fun

so i played 30 or so more hours and realized a second gripe your inventory fills stupid fast and other than the crappy cart and a weight belt that cost a pretty penny your inventory stays the same from start to end to my surprise you cant craft backpacks or any other increase to weight or inventory slots no weightlifters mead i believe these sorts of things should also be added

#####

this is my favorite game ive spent over 1000 hours playing it and i feel like its a world that i visit when i need to leave this one

the gameplay is 95 immersive once the crafting mechanic is well understood using it becomes second nature

the only complaint i have is the process of inventory management which unfortunately consumes a significant portion of every game day since this is an issue most crafting games have to deal with i know it could be much much worse 

with that single caveat ill say that i have spent hours just sitting on beaches near the black forest at night just me and a campfire watching the stars roll across the sky behind the glowing worldtree 

ive stood on the roof of my castle during a thunderstorm hoping to  a glimpse of thor riding the lightning through the clouds

ive huddled in a cave in the mountains waiting for a wolf to trust me enough to come home with me then cried when it was killed on the way back

the music the sound the graphics all work together to create a world in which i the player want to live

i suppose 600 hours is good enough for a review

pros
 excellent take on the openworld survival genre particularly food
 multiple weapons and fighting styles
 massive procgen maps
 simple yet fun approaches to common survival gameplay loops
 excellent price point at least in usd
 some of the best sunsets youll see in any game
 fairly intuitive building system

cons
 incomplete game ea
 graphics style can be offputting
 unacceptable loss of performance in mountain biome
 relative lack of rulesetparameterdifficulty customization

this game has a lot going for it theres not a lot here that would be called innovative but all the usual survival staples are here nourishment status effects environmental concerns etc and some with fresh takes 

the food system in particular is something every other survival developer should be looking at  instead of penalizing the player for not eating through starving to death hobbling the character etc the food system rewards players with added health and stamina in some cases greatly for the extra work they put into obtaining the items and stations needed to make the food its the players choice to pursue that

in fact theres a great degree of freedom of choice in valheim enterprising players who think outside the box can progress just fine in the game acquiring almost everything they need without having to beat any of the bosses the fourth boss requires defeat at this time in order to unlock all crafting options 

valheim is not without its blemishes the graphics style is decidedly lowres which can be offputting to some in the age of 4k and can also be a little misleading  do not think system requirements are lower just because of the heavilypixelated graphics this is particularly true in the mountains and deep north not yet released biomes during blizzardsnowstorm weather events where a loss of up to 70 framerate and performance can be expected even for strong gpus it does bear reminding that the game at this time is still in early access and being worked on by a really small team im very impressed with their work given the developers size so that may not always be the case but it is at present

one area where the game currently lags behind its contemporaries is a lack of difficultyhealthproduction parameters that can be tweaked to adjust the game to taste like one finds on games such as ark and conan exiles there may be mods for this but all of my time so far has been on the vanilla version also be advised that most admin commands do not work on multiplayerdedicated servers even for the game owner some still do but things like god mode flight invincibility and spawnin of items are turned off for dedicated at this time

all told this game even in its early access state is definitely worth adding to any survival fans collection for 20 esp small groups of survival fans i can safely say its a great feeling to be sitting there in the mead hall with your party after the last boss is down dumping most of your mead down your armors chestpiece and puking on your friends to celebrate victory at least until the last three biomes are released 

id give it about four and a half outta five very strong entry in the survival genre by iron gate they should be very proud of themselves and i eagerly await future updates

it scratches and itch for those survival sandbox games but allows you to control your interactions with other players or you can just be solo and explore a huge world  the problem with games like rust is they bring out the worst in humanity whereas valheim looks to actually bring people together  we need more valheims and less rusts


#####

valheim uses a great premise for why you are here you are dead already  time to prove you are worthy to enter valhalla  for once pvp is not the focus of the game  survival and exploration are the focus  whats more your home bases is constantly under threat  you have a reason to build great forts and to seek powerful and rare resources  the enemy is at the gates  you must be strong enough to face them  as you progress the world gets tougher to deal with  best of all there is an actual objective to the game  you are trying to reach valhalla  you will eventually ascend from this realm  how long will it take you and your companions to prove yourselves worthy

probably the best survivalbuilder game of 20202021

#####

imagine if you will that terarria and skyrim had a baby and that baby really liked dark souls

dropped in to valheim to slay some nasty bois whove gotten a bit too bold youll need to master each biome and slay each boss to prove your worth what looks on the surface to be a generic survival craft game actually has the bones of a decent rpg with some lovely music and an art style that lets you appreciate the absolute enormity of the world youre in

your character can drop in and out of others sessions so not being locked to a single server for progression is pretty huge this isnt some rustlike its really intended to be played with friends and build little communities sail the seas and conquer some epic monsters together

#####

valheimanother yet unfinished early access game developed by a really small team normal reaction just leave me alone with this shit

but hold on guysthis one is different its not a hype its just a great game

 you dont need to grind 200 hours to finish this open world game but you can
 you cannot starve to death
 you dont have to walk 1000 miles after death but there is still a little punishment
 building system with structural integrity
 simple but great sailing hello aaa devswind can have a direction  and awesome waves

#####

rly nice game 910 
but it feels like the publishers r taking too many naps on their big pile of money

#####

ok so after finally committing to the game after finally finding people to play it with i can safely give criticism with confidence behind what im saying

valheim is a world that feels alive with some very satisfying mechanics wood cutting great mining excluding copper great

combat feels  very satisfying with quite a few weapon options enemies have certain strategies with select weapons being more effective to fight with against them

boss fights feel very satisfying and give a good sense of progression excluding eikthyr and the queen the first being super easy and needing no gear and the latter will be a bigger breakdown below

i think up until the mistlands the game feels very complete and really well made

now onto the mistlands this may come across as biased but i have looked around on reddit and the feeling seems to be super mutual the mistlands feels more like a chore rather than something to actually take in and enjoy despite having iron padded armour that is fully maxed out which black metal weapons that are completely maxed out i dont expect to walk with this gear into mistlands and breeze through it however i also dont expect to become a blood smear on the impossible to traverse terrain from a couple hits unless im running bonemass buff

i spent 40 hours looking for the infested dungeons in the mistlands fine combing through multiple of the mist biomes i knew what i was searched for because after around 10 hours in i had to search up what they looked like because i thought i was somehow missing them it turns out we had came across a few derelict structures that were meant to have the dungeons attached but for some reason did not
after about 30 hours of having zero luck with dungeons we used a website where you could basically see everything on the seed and we were surprised with how few dungeons there were and how spread out they were after managing to find several dungeons this way we could also not find a single lore tablet that would ping the boss altar and had to use the website to find that also i just think with how bad the terrain is its a great concept but why must i have to traverse this terrain which is also ridiculous with the energy consumption and then have to be super paranoid about having a swarm of seekers or a gjall nuke me to high heavens because visibility is poor sure i can place down torches but only in areas that i havent been

the queen bossfight herself we had also found ridiculous we were buffed level 2 carapace gear and weapons it took us a while we found all previous bosses quite fun even the last couple that had some challenging mechanics but we never sat there and went yeah that boss fight sucked why does the queens health pool have to be so large despite all of her attacks none of them were surprising but there were zero pauses in the fight youre a melee user be prepared to get thrown across the fight arena every time you get close youre a bow user yeah no damage this boss fight is nothing short of complete frustration not to mention with how much hp she has you will break your mistlands tier weapons before even getting her down half her hp is this annoying sure but even with a maxed out black metal shield and a maxed out mist walker sword which seemed to be the most efficient way of killing her we could not stand toe  to toe without bonemass buff this is the only way we found that we could stand our ground
if you are hit by the queen without bonemass buff and you dont time the block like a parry you take an immense amount of damage which combined with seekers that she spawns is pretty much a death sentence you can only pop health pots every few minutes which means that the downtime is insane and i can understand why some people opt for cheesy strategies that involve multiple bows and hundreds of arrows or hundreds of bombs and sitting in spots where she cant reach you

to conclude i think the game is super satisfying to play up until the mistlands where the game feels like it changes genres from a nice survival type of game with a good sense of progression to the new endgame biome where it feels like it transforms into a souls like game while wearing a blindfold of mist where you have to perfect parrying and dodges in order to survive

if mistlands were to receive some power tweaks to the mobs or increase the gear dps by a small amount it would certainly help or even being able to see more with your wisp pet

shouts out to bonemass for having our back in the fight else we would have probably resorted to cheesing her with bombs and bows

#####

its that game where you make good memories and cry about it couple years later xd 1010

#####

lasted 3 different girls and still going

#####

this is a good game 

i put 160 hrs into the beta and the ea release version is quite similar the devs said that its around 5070 complete so expect more items and content coming to it

as an ea title its quite stable i had no crashes or freezes runs well on nvidia 1050ti and core i7 8th gen from ssd 

the game itself is very hard its easy to loose your stuff quickly or get killed in an instant the first instinct would be to corpserun but its actually more hard to pull off than in other games since when you die your hp will reset you have no stamina to run no hp to soak damage food is key in this game and the better you treat yourself the more hp you have berries and mushroom can sustain but only gives a little hp you have 3 food slots and depending on what you eat the more or less hp you will have for a while because it counts down foods loose the effect after a while so if you ear low quality food that is abundant then you only have like 50 hp if you find and cook the beast meats you can have 150 makes night and day difference in fights suggestion if you die dont run immediately back instead make an extra shield and axe extra set of armour make sure you eat the best food you have then go back learn to block parry and counterattack 

the negative stuff unlocking new items can be hard without any knowledge of what you supposed to do you usually unlock more stuff as you pick them up build what you can some items you build will unlock further stuff most brewing is tied to honey which i havent for for until 150 hrs into the game didnt even know it was an option and and it unlocks a ton of stuff your life  can be absolutely go tits up in seconds you can loose you ship your armour your weapon on another island in the middle of the swamp once i spent a whole weekend just trying to get my stuff back from the aforementioned situation

i suspect this game will make many people angry like dark souls but its a good game regardless i recommend

#####

i am traumatized by the swamps

#####

amazing game so far 34 hours in 

its like arkconan meets terraria build a home defend it from things that come at night or are launched every few days in attack waves simple at first but get tougher as your home gets more advanced

massive procedural map so its different every play through like terraria only mobs and food respawn so if you clear an area your done there but there is a lot to explore boats and carts are available to help bring stuff back to your base and you can make portals to get about easier however you cant bring some resources through them hence the need for boats

combats fun with different styles of play depending on the weapon theres a lot to craft and also boss fights the boss fights a very cool and the music and atmosphere during them is metal as fk

building is great but needs a bit of working around you cant build out or down very well so need to stand on the side your building towards you can build from the side but some times things dont snap in place once i got used to it i find it better than ark and conans building building over water is difficult though as its hard to place stuff with no land to stand on

over all a great game so far we have 7 people in our village and its been a blast home is made gear is crafted and were ready to explore the world

i cant wait to see how this game does in the future what they have so far is well worth the money gives you a lot to do and has so much potential for the future

#####

got comfortable with the game
tackled the 2nd boss with 2 of my friends
watched them and our longboat get one shotted by a 1 star troll outta nowhere
died 3 times trying to get our stuff back and lost another 2 ships
cried due to laughing so hard
1010 would recommend 


#####

much more polished than any other early access game i have played very fun and engaging model resolution is a little lacking but its so fun i barely notice and dont care 92 hours as of this writing and only killed the second boss i can easily see myself putting in 1000 hours great value for the money my favorite feature is that i can play solo or wirh friends that is what was missing from skyrim and fallout 4 for me this game is batter than fallout 76 imo the base building is amazing and a double bonus vikings if you like survival games get this now

#####

valheim is an open world game with a focus on exploration but that doesnt mean that there isnt a set goal your goal in valheim is to bring order to the 10th norse world you will do this by hunting down and defeating odins greatest enemies and offering their trophys to the gods as you progress through the different enemies they will get stronger and stronger naturally to stand a chance against these boss creatures you will find yourself hunting for new materials to craft better gear 

well if you want to have a fighting chance at living through the many encounters youll face youll want to go in armed with the knowledge of how to cook and eat the many foods available to you the game is a challenging take on surviving in frigid lands swarming with trolls skeletons leeches slimes and more you can even summon up huge bosses and take them on



#####

i would write a full review about this game if i wasnt too busy playing it

#####

by far one of the best games ive played in years
the biomes are all unique and beautiful they each have their own mood which makes you feel like the world is huge and immersive and also the worlds are huge and immersive lol

the building mechanics are so fun ive literally spent days just building castles cabins farms and villages its highly addicting to build your own little fantasy world and then play in it with others
the combat is great you can easily bite off more than you can handle so its difficult and thus rewarding when you get upgrades that you worked hard to accomplish

i could go on and on about this game but overall ill say this is my current cozy time game and it will continue to be for many years
thank you devs for this incredible game 3 3

#####

myself wife and kids all love this game great game to have a family of 6 make a village and play together the developer has been updating and refining things within the game thank you iron gate studio

#####

rock and stone brothers

#####

i am currently stranded on an islandrock in the middle of an ocean with 280lb of bronze and decisions need to be made

#####

200 hours and i didnt leave a review 

forgive me iron gate

tldr  game fun its viking minecraft with less blocks and less digging into the earth


pros
base building
farming you can tame some animals
fishing there is a very big issue though
cookingeating
boat sailing
resource collecting chop trees mine rocks gather foodplants kill stuff get stuff
item upgrading
beautiful music
amazing lighting
pleasant art style
procedurally generated worlds can possibly screw you over


cons
combat is basic
no magic system
they keep nerfing the bow
getting a fishing rod
getting fucked by procedurally generated world


the combat is passablebut i would not complain if they enhanced it

there is no magic in this game other than some buffs you get from defeating the bosses i guess

sometimes you get a really strange seed and can not easily progress or you have far too much water 7810
at least they sort of fixed sailing with the wind rng

as someone who enjoys fishing in games getting a fishing rod is the most fucking aggravating thing in this game bar none nothing else frustrates me more than this fuck you iron gate which one of you thought it was a good idea to gate fishing behind a randomly located shop keep

i was something like 120 hours in on my maybe 5th world before i even found the shop keeper terrible

hey man theres fishing in this game what no there isnt
yeah you get it from the  shop keeper what shop keeper there isnt a shop keeper what are you doing

fuck you again iron gate but ill forgive you for that meadows music

so anyway

 


this game is amazing greatly enhanced with friends

but i have to say the #1 thing keeping me playing this game is the meadows area music 

let me say that again

the music that plays in the meadows  is probably the only reason i have thoroughly enjoyed the 200 hours i have on this game something about it is so enchanting its so calming it really elevates the experience

i go out of my way to make sure my bases are in the meadows with a lovely view

so on the friends thing i dont know if i would be able to enjoy this game as much alone unfortunately i dont have a guild or a group of friends to enjoy this with i am jealous of you with 3 friends who also want to play this game

theres just something really fun about working together to build your base or keep your farms properly tended to or having someone to coordinate work with like having someone go out and mine ore while someone stays back and gets the proper upgrades ready for the team or having someone go out and hunt and gather food for everyone

 i seem to be the only one in my group of friends that 
 enjoys fantasy games 
 does not want to spend the rest of their life playing a shooter

did i mention how much i love the meadows music

if you enjoyed my ramblings like share and subscribe or dont see if i care

#####

ah yes breath of the soulscraft

its like if someone who just returned from a viking museum took acid while watching hgtv

minecraft with vikings is literally what i tell normal people

3d terraria with vikings is what i tell gamers

my wifes boyfriend calls it viking minecraft with wicked graphics and adventure

do you want to escape real life but still suffer valheim i love this game

its a grindy nordic mythology influenced viking survivalcraftingexploration game with a little bit of management and farming the most casual brutal survival game on steam a viking purgatory playhouse the most relaxing stressful game youll ever love

its the tale of some woodchopping half dead half alive dude with amnesia who is trying to remember and build things and tries not to get killed by dwarves and boars while munching on mushrooms during a thunderstorm

valheim does not love you it gives exactly zero effs how hard it was to fully upgrade your bronze armor and sail to the plains for the first time i remember thinking alright fully upgraded bronze time to go on an adventure i took my karve north and landed on a beautiful island soon enough i found a cute little giggling green man with a club

you died

a mining wood chopping and building simulator where enemies occasionally interfere and enemies can occasionally be trees the best tree chopping simulator ever made no joke i could spend hours just chopping trees in this game and i have

it blends a number of different games into an extremely satisfying gameplay loop youve got the exploration of minecraft the combat of dark souls to a degree the construction system of rust and the gameplay loop of terraria and its primarily coop its really enjoyable to jump on your friends world and help him out with something and vice versa

among a variety of little things that forms a collection of reasons i love the game it pretty much all boils down to the fact that the game brings out a calm in me that i dont get in a fast paced and demanding professional life it does what a game should do by letting me escape and relax in another world i mean outside of the bosses and sometimes the plains and sometimes the greydwarves crash the calm it is the right amount of little stress whenever you need it you dont just venture to the plains expecting everything to be just fine after all

i like it because i can do fun building  tower defense strategy chill gaming and then super hard exploration adventuring gaming at whatever interval i feel like there are no anxiety driving timers to make things hard just fighting skill and infrastructure to make it easier

if i want to be alone i can play alone if i want to play with friends i can jump on the shared sever 

but mostly i just like the calm ambiance of the world how relaxing sailing is how every biome is beautiful in its own way the fact i dont have to get a new graphics card to play it since i havent been able to buy one after 5 years of trying is a big plus but the lighting still makes it beautiful and atmospheric valheim is my happy place until the ground starts shaking

its just perfect

listen to me listen this game is my favorite survivalcrafting game ever you probably remember the iseai of survivalcrafting games that came out during the minecraftyoutube boom of the late 2000s youve probably played a lot of them youre probably sick of them but listen we needed those games to walk so that valheim could run

if youre gonna take anything away from my review let it be this i cant play minecraft anymore because every time i do i just end up wishing i was playing valheim instead

#####

dopamine gland hijacking sensation from repetitive menial tasks hugely satisfactory time sink of a complex building system endless opportunity for antics with pals topped off with assclenching parry based combat system of a souls game

#####

as long the bees are happy im happy too

#####

thought this was just the next flavor of the month open world survival craft game that came at the perfect time but it has been an amazing experience and super fun to play 

being mostly developed on linux it has an excellent linux version with both opengl and vulkan support absolutely incredible especially for a unity engine game with an installation size of only 1gb

20 and its better than most 60 aaa games proving once again that gameplay  graphics with that said the graphical style is beautiful and the combination of simple textures and 3d models with modern effects like dof and ssao is awesome

b tldr if youre wondering whether you should get this game or not the answer is yes b

b 1 not your typical crafting clone b
ive logged probably thousands of hours in survival crafting games  minecraft terraria subnautica starbound you name it  and to relegate valheim into that genre would be doing it a disservice sure crafting is a large part of the game and a procedurally generated world isnt anything groundbreaking however valheim has a skill system that is absent in most titles of the genre every action that you perform in the game  cutting wood archery running and jumping  is tied to a skill your first few shots with the bow will be inaccurate and underwhelming but as you level up your archery skill youll be dropping deer effortlessly on top of the rpgesque skill system valheim also gives you a purpose and direction for your exploration there are several forsaken bosses to take out as you progress through the world each unlocking a special buff or power for your character i wont go into too much detail here to prevent spoilers but i will say that so far the boss fights are exciting and challenging and reminiscent of dark souls the combat in general feels much more satisfying than many others in the genre starvation isnt a mechanic in valheim which will appeal to some and annoy others food is important but its used more for buffs and combat in a similar vein to breath of the wild


b 2 from mud huts to mead halls b
lets start off with the most important part the building system in valheim i feels i great its not a cumbersome system and ive found myself looking for reasons to add a new structure to our camp or tweak an existing building just for the fun of it there are some quirks like the stability system but they dont detract from the base building at all in fact i appreciate that the devs took a more realistic approach here as it reinforces the games oldschool rpg theme if you want to place a tall roof youll need to reinforce your walls with poles and your ceiling with beams there wont be any floating dirt fortresses here i havent even encountered stone as a building material yet but even the different types of wood offer a variety of ways to build reinforce and decorate your base the snapping is inconsistent at times but overall the building system is in a great place and offers hours of enjoyment in figuring out how and where you want to build your bases theres also a great system for quickly travelling from one place to another but i wont spoil any details part of the experience is figuring it out on your own


b 3 dont let early access scare you b
like many gamers ive been burned by early access titles before it can be scary to buy a product and not know whether it will actually be finished in 8  12 months i can confidently say that even at launch valheim has a lot of content and feels pretty polished the game looks good and is pretty well optimized using a 2070s im averaging 90  100 fps using max settings on 1440p resolution during the 1516 hours of gameplay ive logged since launch i havent encountered many bugs at all and definitely none that have affected the experience i havent encountered any placeholder areas or items and everything works very well the physics system also feels very good depending on your speed of play and how many others accompany you i would guess that valheim easily provides 40  50 hours of play in its current state with a large open world procedural generation and a deep building system i wouldnt be surprised to spend over 100

u conclusion u
valheim gives me heavy oldschool rpg vibes  its got that nostalgic charm of games like gauntlet champions of norrath or runescape but with some modern quality of life features a strong building system and an engaging openworld setting the combat is difficult but not overy complicated the game is great in its current state and im very excited to see how it develops over the next year


#####

i adore the progression of valheim you level up your skill with particular weapons or tools through using them thats pretty standard but your base stats health and stamina are affected entirely by what you eat eat only berries and youre a paperweight who can run twenty feet before passing out eat a full feast of meat pie sausage cake and mead and youre ready to strike down all the mighty forsaken who dare stand against you as you progress you get access to better food ingredients and recipes allowing you to tackle mightier enemies and gather sturdier resources in the meantime theres an engaging basebuilding system with buildings providing shelter and having a comfort value the comfier your house the faster your stamina recharges while in it just begging you to decorate which i think is hilarious since you play as a battlehardened viking warrior who comes home from slaying draugr and drakes to make sure his furniture is placed just right another thing i find worth mentioning is sailing which can genuinely be a ton of fun especially when a sea serpent appears and sends you into a panic as it tries to rip your boat apart also you can play with a ton of friends not only as coop but as factionbased pvp or pure anarchy valheims got a little something for everyone and its only in ea meaning its only going up from there i give it 9 hugins out of 10 with high hopes for the future

#####

it is like age of empires but you get to play only as the villager

1010  would spend another 500 hours collecting wood stone and berries

#####

always make sure the bees are happy

#####

over 700 hours played on this game in early access let me dispel any misconceptions for any of the not recommended reviews out there 

game is in early access for 20 i played before the hearth and home update came out also before the caves update came out every time they add new content to the game its thoughtful polished and incredibly fun 

for a game thats technicallypossibly half finished there is so much to do so many things to build and so many ways to explore and enjoy yourself not to mention the growing modding community that ive barely put any time into the last time i experienced a game like this where i knew i could play this for years and years it was when skyrim came out in 2011 

the game isnt finished if youre looking for a complete story for a constant content millliveservice game its not going to be for you but if youre looking for a game where you can express yourself creatively where you can develop your own narratives and even enjoy time cooping with your friends the game is perfectand again theyre maybe halfway done with the game 

too many players downvoting this game in early access 700 hours of fun for 20 is beyond worth it 300 hours of fun for 20 would be worth it when they eventually release the game in full ill probably buy another copy of the game just to say thank you 

its an awesome atmospheric builder that just keeps getting better

#####

#####

like terraria but 3d and filled with norse mythology

#####

im 87 years old and ive been gaming since world war 2 i love valheim

#####

its a nice game for an early access survival it is very much fleshed out and has astonishingly few bugs 

some things i dont like this far

 stamina it is a real fun breaker for me you need it for everything even building fighting an enemy you need it to attack dodge block and run away so if your stamina is low while fighting  there is practically nothing you can do youre practically done want to hurt him no stamina block or dodge his attacks no stamina run away no stamina

 some events are in dire need of rebalancing the wolf hunt is the most unbalanced of all as soon as you beat a certain boss you can be hunted any time every other event is staged on your base only not this it can catch you in the middle of the plains with your pants down about 8 wolves spawn to attack you while not very durable they hit hard if you manage to kill those guess what 8 new ones spawn at once not long till your stamina is gone and youll die even in toptier gear if are not near a place to cheese the ai youre dead at least they seem to have patched in so that event is only active for a certain amount of time and ends automatically even without you being there before that we had a case of group wipe without chance of getting or stuff back you cannot stay inside the area without gear because the wolves will instakill you again and if you dont stay inside the circle the event wouldnt end

 death penalty i get it death has to have some punishment but losing 5 of all your skills and your whole inventory forcing you to run naked to get it back thats a bit harsh especially for solo players i completely gave up actively trying to levelup skills what for youll loose it anyway if youd only loose the progress to the next skill level id be fine with it 

 the wind while sailing i could swear the game actively hinders you as soon as you set sail because 75 of the time wind will blow right into your face this needs to change because the boat tour turns into a slog

 we need more clear weather at least 50 of the time its either dark or raining cats and dogs which is bad because in rain you become wet and cold giving a penalty to your stamina regen see above and its annoying if you want to build a house and dont see anything

 greydwarf spawn while dangerous for you in the beginning spawning in groups of up to seven they soon turn to nuisance you cannot set your foot into the black forest without bothered by hoards of dwarfs they dont even do damage later ingame 08 points or so but they are so annoying and respawn fast this leads to litter because you cannot keep everything they drop the floor is soon to be filled with piles of grey dwarf eyes wood stone trophies flowers if you want to clear the floor this leads to another respawn which leads again to litter so please please please tone down the spawn of graydwarfes in the forest by at least 50

 why can a troll hit me with his club when im standing on the other side of 6 meters high and 1 meter deep massive stone wall 

 while i can understand why you couldnt use a portal with ores in your inventory in connection with the strange wind while sailing this only serves to slow the game process down like tying a stone to your foot you want to smelt silver ok you build a small base near the snow now you need a forge a forge needs bronze you have a portal in your new base but this doesnt help you need to drive back via ship and get some bronze from another base but to build something out of silver you forge needs upgrades which need iron iron is only in swamps so take your boat to a base near a swamp fetch some iron come back i could live with a compromise that you cant use a portal with ores but with processed ingots you should you can use a portal with a silver sword but not with the silver used to create the sword come on

 radius of workbenches and stonecutters should at least be doubled

 we are in dire need of performance tuning for large buildings building is the only endgame in the moment and if you build something big your fps will drop dramatically

 network code is wonky every second day guest players get disconnected from the hosts game with no obvious reasons playing a dedicated server everybody was kicked at least twice per session even the host in whose lan the server was hosted

i had my fun in 437 hours ingame so i can recommend this game to every survival fan its really good but now the game is on the point of becoming stale we need more content but its still in early access and the team is small so i think the game will improve vastly in time

i moved from my hometown into the sticks due to my wifes work because of this i dont get to see my best friends very often i got this game a week ago and now i do i immediately paid for a server and put a map up for me and them to play on the adventures weve already had have been nothing short of incredible

the last time i played i guided my friend into our towns port during a massive storm during the night with a torch while waving at him he saw me and followed my light desperately trying not to capsize the ship i jumped onto the ship when he was finally close enough and guided him in avoiding the rocky shoreline just as he made it to safety an ominous message appears the forest is moving shortly after that we are at the walls fighting for our right to exist

weve fought enemies together run from trolls built an awesome town and explored new dangerous lands together we plot risky expeditions together to get resources we work divide resources and overcome challenges together sometimes we just enjoy the fire and talk about whats going on in real life it has been an absolute blast i didnt think memories like this were possible to be made in a game

the building mechanics are the best ive seen in any game too by a great margin they allow for so much expression resource gathering is fun combat is difficult and you have to not only levelget better gear but get better yourself at the mechanics this naturally happens when you play the game too so dont worry its not dark souls

the art style is gorgeous it has so much charisma and charm the lighting and dynamic weather wrap it all together in a beautiful package this game also has wind mechanics and a cool physics system with the trees be careful when cutting them down or it could start a domino effect this game makes you feel positive about the future of procedural generation the seed we play feels handcrafted its not just an empty map either there are different dungeon and enemy types there are also ruins you can mark and name everything you find on your map too its so cool

just as you think youve seen everything the game pours more and more content onto the screen with so many new things to do i cant believe this game says its still in early access because it is one of the most polished and complete experiences ive ever had with a game i would recommend it to anyone 1110

get this game

#####

so heres how things will go if you buy this game download complain about the graphics say how its a reskin of minecraft get killed by a boar run away wander too far into the black forest run for your life away from the locals find yourself in the most intense thunderstorm a game can deliver be in absolute awe of the lightning hide in desperation the first night because you were too busy running away from greylings and boars the first day to collect any materials and get to see why this is a beautiful game when the sun rises on day 2 above the canopy of the meadow youre in welcoming you to the most brutal and aesthetic game youll play in a while

#####

my experience has been 910

cons
 the lack of scaling when it comes to skills lost on death makes death incredibly frustrating the higher your skills are though some would see this as a pro
 the state of the game development means that especially with a normal computer that isnt top of the line the game will sometimes be buggy and you might come into problems like lag that are difficult to find a fix for and it can happen often there are online communities that can help though
 for the same reason as above mods are not guaranteed to run smoothly and even if they do they might not continue to as the game is updated
 there is literally only one npc a trader and they become obsolete very early on in the game which takes the fun out of treasurehunting as goldgemsjewellery become useful only for turning into coal which is very easy to produce by other means

pros too many to list
 the world is so immersive that it is often hard to believe it is procedurally generated you will often find yourself in situations and areas that are so unique and entertaining they seem like they must have been written
 the art style is beautiful for someone that lives in an urban landscape this game is a perfect escape there are consistently gorgeous areasaspects but the weather system and other random elements provide you with some rare and unique moments of joy
 you have complete freedom to do anything as you wish there is so much you can do in this game that no one else has done and there is no obligation to do anything but what you feel like doing by comparison skyrim feels like a 2d platformer
 the creatures are both hilarious and terrifying and the ai that drives them though simple is challenging and very fun to play against
 the way the game develops creates many situations where you are taken by surprise more so the less you have researched prior to playing as soon as you feel safe the game has a way of putting the fear back into you and making you think on your feet
 the building aspect of the game is both more challenging and more fun than in any other game i have played and all the above pros make it very rewarding you can find so many different reasons to build and so many different ways to build and the resulting aesthetics can be fantastic the game would benefit from some additional buildpieces and options but with mods like plant everything snap points made easy or precise rotation you will find the possibilities are limitless although if you really like a challenge realising a creative vision then vanilla building will certainly give you a good experience building is the main reason i play and there are always new and exciting challenges

i fought through valheim with my friend and we became true vikings

we departed from the game with tons of memories but also a hint of bitterness

when the game started first few hours were like a dream i have never come to a survival game with such good vibes but after first and second bossfight the gameplay took a hard shift grinding the materials copper metal iron silver black iron more iron it felt like they had wanted to forcefully make the game brutal and came tonedeaf while doing so 

however good an armor can be it should not take hours and hours of mining transporting and smelting for just one set this isnt even so much as brutal but only tedious and painstaking also the joy of acquiring new materials and recipes that was present at the first ten hours of the game dissappeared new items and decorative pieces become a rarity at middle and endgame

other thing to grip on are some of the enemies the status effects they grant are harsh one fart from a blob and you are pretty much doomed youll need to craft and grind potions that take forever to ferment this is fine but could really use some rebalancing also some of ranged enemies basically draugrs have such harsh aimbot feel to them that can be very frustrating at this point of the game my friends stuff bugged through the ground when he died and we had to grind the again for him also when he crashed his character rolled back and he lost some of the equipment i gave for him

game does impressive work at hinting players what to do next we went through the entire game with using wiki only once this was at the third boss here game practically assumes that player knows that slime  ice  success we had no idea that we were suppost to grind frost arrows to fight the bonemass well we just left the slob sitting on his arena and came back with frostenchanted weapons and arrows about ten hours later last three bosses were kinda tired they all got stuck and we basically stood and spammed arrows at them

valheim has really interesting and unique hungersystem but it is also ruined by the brutal neverending grind all the time you dont spend hauling ores you are at some sickened farmyard waiting for carrots to grow its awful

i might have been pretty hard on valheim but i still give it a thumbs up because even though its grind can be nearly lunatic it had such fun mechanics building combat collecting trophies and beautiful graphics i cant believe so many game reviewers call this game ugly it has really consistent and charming art style many people call it the ps1 art style though it does not feel so when playing it it had lots of fun memorable moments that i will keep in my mind for a long long time

after all this i cant say i want to return to the game after it gets updates and more content the grind is just too much even if i can still continue with same character and save grind is such a hard turnoff for me i cant see myself playing this game for a long while after this

this review was written after finishing valheim in 96 hours and with two players at version 01562

#####

really fun game but updates are really slow sadly

#####

reject modernity return to viking

#####

worth way more then 1999

h1a review from someone who doesnt play survival crafting gamesh1
after hearing about all the hype about this game i just had to give it a try could this be the survival crafting game to play for someone who doesnt care for minecraft or rust could this be one of those games from niche genres that somehow manages to capture mass audiences eg euro truck simulator

i guess the answer to that would be somewhat

the only other crafting game that ive played and enjoyed is terraria so i did at least understand the basics of gathering materials and building a home it didnt take long for me to figure out what i needed to do in this game and this is coming from someone who has no idea how to play minecraft
the mechanics in this game are really forgiving for beginners because you dont seem to be able to die from starvation or dehydration also you can kill pretty much all of the early mobs with just your fists without much difficulty another thing i found helpful was an npc told me what i needed to do in order to get to the first boss and after about 2 hours of gameplay i managed to beat the first boss 
did i have the best time getting there no it was entertaining and somewhat addictive but gameplay didnt blow me away like the first time i played games like mgsv ac origins or hollow knight i suppose its because i dont have any other survival games to compare this game to but thats what this review is all about
i should also mention that while this game can be easily played singleplayer youre likely going to have way more fun playing this game with friends

overall this game feels a little like the fall guys fad its undoubtedly fun but by no metric is the best game ive ever played and considering that this is early access and the fact that i despise survival crafting games id say this game is still pretty darn good it actually got me to put 2 hours into it ill probably play more of it too


beditb
seeing as ive put in an additional 30 hours on this game since writing my review i think it should be pretty evident that i like this game heres a quick summary of imo the pros and cons of this game

h1prosh1
 sailing across the ocean to find new land feels awesome
 world looks pretty good despite the lowres graphics
 progression is done pretty well goals are clearly defined
 boss fights are pretty epic
 pretty much bugfree despite being early access

h1consh1
 weight limit on inventory is unnecessarily constraining
 mining and transporting ore back to your base can get pretty tediousrepetitive
 linking building structures walls planks etc isnt very seamless
 manipulating land flattening raising sloping is really a pain
 stamina bar makes your viking seem asthmatic


h1tldrh1
bis this the best game everb not for me it isnt
bis this worth playing for someone who doesnt care about survival sandbox gamesb yes

#####

first game ive had for three days and already managed to clear 50 hours in if this is early access and the developer continues their phenomenal work valheim might go down as the most played game in a single sitting for me of all time

#####

hi there this my first review i kinda gave up on games for a long time but im really impressed with this one 

this game is full of surprises right from the start as you explore and adapt to the world around you you create bases out of your means and everything you get is well earned you can play at your own pace and fight the bosses whenever youre ready which when beaten naturally makes the game harder theres so much variety and each boss gives you something completely different each biome can be beguiling and you may have to steer clear of some areas until youre ready

i like how your skills increase and refine as you use them  it feels more real and i love how you can be very creative in building you can even make basements which i use for brewing mead lots to show off in this game i love to be able to show off my creativity and skills

the ocean looks totally awesome and i like the detail in the sunlight and shadows 

having friends play on your world when your offline is not so easy however

so there you have it i find this game feels more real than others ive played and gives more creativity in your home it will always keep you on your toes  i know my dad would have just loved this game rest his soul give it a chance i know  youll have fun

#####

valheim b appeared out of nowhere b and b addicted me b for weeks

i wanted to wait until i finished to make a proper review of this game which was a surprise for me and all friends ive played or spoke about it even more for an b early access titleb the game contains great features from a lot of praised games in the industry blending it all together with their own style like introducing bosses with unique mechanics this game is a great addition to the survival genre

list
 u b graphics b u  it didnt look good at first but considering the size of the files ang after getting used to they did a pretty good job i was really impressed of how all the biomes and buildings were turning out to look so great i have also to acknowledge how good the lightning is especially at night
 u b world b u  the world creation is clever currently separated by 5 biomes each one has their own looks monsters materials bosses and of course a different level of difficult making you slowly grind and explore each one of them deeply creating knowledge about specific things from them and its huge
 u b progression b u  the world and the progression are perfectly combined one of the best progressions ive played in a game so far you must slowly explore and grind through all the biomes the game offers you and by each one of them the game becomes more interesting challenging and introduces new featurestechnologies
 u b base construction b u  i love building in this game it is probably my favorite aspect since everything that is built looks great and with many resources to improve the land and the base itself but the game forces you to build a lot of different bases on the map making most of them go abandoned or made with not much effort
 u b hardcore and survival b u  there are many aspects that make this game a hardcore survival being tough to keep yourself alive if you dont be careful and smart food resources and the hardest mechanic to deal the stamina that drains with literally every action you make 
list

this game was a pleasant surprise that made me play nonstop during 1 month with my friends having so much content to offer already included in the game definetly worth what ive paid for containing fewer bugs than some full release games a surprise to be sure but awelcome one the hype might be over but you will have plenty content to delight alone or with friends this is not a massively multiplayer that needs updates all the time

valheim came out of nowhere and have conquered more than 5 million players i will most definitely b recommend this title to everyone b its challenging creative well interwined with nordic mythology plenty of features and low price took me 90 hours to do everything it had to offer and there is more planned for b free b in the future like the heart  home update but considering that this is a small developer it might take a long time for huge updates

u b rate 86100 b u

#####

a good unfinished game and worth the money

be warned      the devs are very very slow on updates

#####

first things first i want to clarify that i dont have much experience in the survival genre i did play a few titles like this but most often than not i had a lovehate relationship with them these type of games tend to have a lot of elements i enjoy but i still felt like they were not my cup of tea 
when i saw its tags i didnt have high expectations for valheim either but ive decided to give it a try because of a friend my journey in the viking purgatory started at said friends carefully crafted base he happily toured me around his growing village and showed me the ropes to help me get started his enthusiasm slowly seeped into my soul and i realised this game is actually quite addictive especially the base building part 
to sum up my experience odin can solve his own problems im gonna build the most majestic base ever instead psst i only have vague memories of the sunlight and the outside world please send help and more wood
im taking everything slowly im not sure what the endgame is like i have a lot of bosses and undiscovered techs left but im definitely entertained it honestly surprises me this is an early access its in a very good state so far feels like a complete experience 
the visuals might appear dated on first sight but inside the game its remarkably charming the weather effects the lights the shadows and the textures create something very magical and breathing there are a lot of backtracking while our viking hunts for resources but i did not mind it at all since it meant i could travel around in this beautiful world its a good indication that my screenshot folder is getting bigger and bigger as i play it truly gives the feeling of exploration and wonder
i have to mention the grind though valheim has a ton of it but to me its the good kind of grind im actually enjoying what im doing the music the visuals and the various systems in place create a very nice blend 
in my opinion this game deserves a place in any players library who enjoys base building and survivalexploration elements

#####

boy dinner deer i punched to death

#####

this game is so addictive first day i put in over 10 hours then i literally forgot the outside world existed

#####

those damn mosquitoes 

#####

i have played through yagluth 5th boss solo i originally feared a solo playthrough would be slow grindy and tedious while it has been some of that it was never too much for me there is great depth and a nice difficulty curve it is amazing that this game is both in early access and the price it is 

that said as a solo player i found the swamp most annoying the rain and darkness are irritating but getting all the iron i needed out was aggravating my first swamp had a single crypt with 0 iron which was bothersome too  i moved to another map and found a nice swamp which also made moving material much easier 

the map feels too big i have explored so little of my main world and still have seen all the unique locations at least as far as i know sailing is slow even in the best conditions if only hugin could carry me while scouting large areas of the map i hope the procedural mechanics of the map generation will be tweaked for a little less randomness when it comes to small useless biomes like a swamp too small for any real purpose at this point i can only marvel at the wonders i have seen built because for me the building snap is too weak and just not enjoyable enough to get very creative 

performance is ok at best on my system details below  most of the time in the 3045 fps range with some settings turned down there have been several occasions where things have slowed down even more i hope there are some performance tweaks that can be done and are not limited to the engine 

i look forward to having more ingame goals and can recommend this to anyone knowing how entertaining my 100 hours ingame and many hours out have been

first things first the graphics are off the charts i mean sailing through misty fjords or going toetotoe with legendary creatures in thick forests its like the devs sprinkled magic pixels everywhere the weather changing on the fly and the daynight cycle just adds this crazy level of realism that sucks you right into the viking universe

now lets talk teamwork valheim is all about it gathering resources building epic longhouses and taking down colossal bosses with your buddies thats where the real magic happens youll be highfiving your friends and screaming in victory as you carve out your viking legacy together its an absolute blast

crafting is a gamechanger too want a massive axe to crush enemies you got it prefer to pick enemies off from a distance with a killer bow valheims got your back the game lets you go nuts with your gear and trust me its addictively fun to experiment and see what works for your style

oh and the music the soundtrack is like the icing on the viking cake its haunting its epic and itll stick with you even after youve put down your battle axe it adds this whole other layer of atmosphere thats just downright awesome

in a nutshell valheim isnt just a game its a masterpiece  if youre after a game that transports you to a mythical viking world giving you endless hours of fun valheim is the real deal cheers to the devs for crafting this badass adventure  skål


#####

i hate this game i have 212 hours in it i hate it ive redownloaded it because i miss the abuse i hate it i now have stockholm syndrome because of this game i love this game

#####

early access  open world  survival this combo strikes fear into the hearts of most steam users while i cant speak for everyone else ive been burned more times than either me or my wallet would care to admit with this trifecta of tags but in comes valheim a game that not only renews my faith in the ea program on steam but completely reinvigorated my love for open world crafting games 

the opening hours of the game will lead you down a path of pure survival scavenging for food to get a little more leeway with your health and stamina bars scrounging for materials in the world that you have access to like sticks and rocks then you start to build your base a place that you will become emotionally attached to for many hours to come it starts small and grows incrementally with your progress with every fogged area of the map you uncover a part of you is uncovered as well you begin to learn you begin to grow you begin to understand what this world has to offer 

the sense of progression in the game is second to none as you become comfortable with your current gear type and weapon loadout you move on to areas that force you to remember the basics of your early time playing running into a new biome with your bow drawn and your healing pots at the ready does little to prepare you for the stomping you will be given by your new enemy types you are sent down a fairly linear path of progression that feels anything but linear this world is huge getting places takes time even portals dont ensure a quick romp around the map as you are restricted from taking precious ore via gateways so you learn paths you sail into uncharted waters you load carts that make the journey across familiar land profitable but dangerous 

there are crypts to explore denizens that raid your base at the worst times varied biomes that not only feel different but offer very different challenges there are bosses that are shrouded in mystery in which subtle clues are given on how to summon them they challenge you to push where you are at in the game and where you think you are at you will lose all sense of reality in this game and youll love every minute of it death is a check box on your what not to do list exploration is rewarding and awe inspiring gameplay is fun and offers you endless ways to go about your progression throw in some friends and you have a recipe for one of the most satisfying games ive played in a looooong time 

if this what early access is supposed to be id urge other developers to watch closely if this even gets marginally better before release its still miles ahead of the competition do yourself a favor and get this game buy copies for your friends buy copies for people you dont know youll enjoy your stay in valheim even if everything is trying its best to murder you and all that youve worked so hard to build

#####

my biggest advice is dont spoil whats in the game by looking up everything in each biome try to keep as many things as you can a mystery once you loose that sense of adventure it wont be as fun other than that this game is incredible its hard very hard and even frustrating at times but it makes everything that much more of an accomplishment once you get the thing your trying to do done this is the first review ive made on a game but i had to make a comment on this one this games got my full support

#####

so its a survival rpg game think of it as rust meets minecraft meets old school mmorpgrunescape everything you do in the game from running jumping swimming fighting chopping down trees mining etc has a skill that you level up as you do these chores and you get more proficient at it the world is packed with creatures dungeons and randomly generated structures even enemy spawners the early areas are easier they are more focused on gathering and hunting but as you progress further you will encounter different and more dangerous biomes where you can get access to rarer materials but also stronger enemies progression in this game is surprisingly slow reminds me of rust in the sense that it took me an entire day of gaming and grinding and exploring to make my first bronze ingot i imagine theres also iron steel and all those things that came after the bronze age you unlock recipes as you get the materials and not before so the list is rather small at first but by the time you reach bronze you have a really huge list of craftables you can build in the game and dont take its building feature lightly not only is it very deep and well done you kinda need to build your base and prepare for enemies just like in rust except its not players its mobs after a certain time or ingame days enemies will randomly attack your base i imagine those attacks will become more frequent and harder to deal with

to summarize i really think this is a well packed and dense experience for the money you pay it has a lot of content specially for something also in early access i was expecting a buggy incomplete mess but ended up finding the opposite what it sets out to do survivalrpgcoop it does really well my one and only complaint at first was the lousy graphics but as you start playing the game and you get immersed in the soundtrack and gameplay you kinda start admiring them as its own art form i think as a small studio i understand what matter is the content you provide not how it looks

summary i had a lot of fun so far and im sure anyone buying this game for its tags wont regret getting it

#####

i swear im not an addict




#####

this game is on my top 5

valheim is a game like rust or minecraft that drops you in with nothing and youve gotta build yourself from the ground up with the resources around you each biome has its own set of creatures resources upgrades and a boss etc the hud is very minimal the graphics may seem slightly low at first but very quickly youll realize how much the game cleverly utilizes its art style to allow for a massive seamless environment which provides a sense of immersion that you will definitely appreciate 

i play solo with no mods which makes the game very difficult it forces me to be strategic and prepared for anything especially when traversing a new biome i will never forget the genuine fear and excitement i experienced when i first stepped foot into the mistlands if you love adventure and exploration this is definitely a game for you 

its highly modifiable so if you like to have shortcuts and qol improvements those are available too i feel like those take away from the games integrity immersive qualities and difficulty so i prefer not to use them if they finish the game and ive completed everything i might give those a spin its also very lightweight i like to stream and afk games like runescape in the background and i have no issues doing so with this game the windowed version runs seamlessly and i can alttab between windows very quickly

the best part about this game is that they keep on making it even better theyve released whole new biomes without disrupting the flow of the game slowly ive also noticed a lot of progress with the base ui graphics inventory management bugs etc 

very well done  great work

extra thoughts im hoping at some point they can add an ingame feature that allows me to link a new world to my original one a little more directly since my original world is struggling to have space for the updates ive had it since around release though and its taken me this long to start having that problem so im definitely not complaining lol but the feature would be much appreciated otherwise the process of transferring things over is going to be very tedious you can take your character from one world to another but only with the items in your inventory moving between the character menu and another world each time is a little rough p this game means a lot to me and i dont think ill ever stop playing it

#####

despite being in early access this game is already better than some established games in the genre

when you first start in valheim survival is very similar to most survival games gather gear food and resources construct a starter base and then proceed on your way through the realmworld of valheim but as you progress defeat bosses and proceed to harder areas of the game you will need to unlock better skills and acquire stronger gear to survive in these areas otherwise for most casual players you will most likely die in these areas 

valheim players can spend hours constructing cabins fortresses or an entire village without having to worry about hunger and thirst which i really enjoy compared to say minecraft where eating is a main component or survival increasing stamina through food can help expedite the process but players are able to do so because they actually want to rather than have to and because players characters experience valheim as fallen warriors not eating doesnt break the games immersion

obtaining higher quality food in valheim can be difficult but is essential for fighting strong enemies such as valheims goblinlike fulings which drop precious resources like black metal scraps its advisable for players to stock up and store food whenever possible especially those with high base stats like lox meat pie or serpent stew to prepare for these encounters these recipes require ingredients that can be hard to get like barley flour or serpent meat yet because valheims survival system deals away with maintaining hunger acquiring these items is more of a fun challenge than a monotonous pain

in a world of viking and norse lore it makes sense that death is not the end of your adventures in valheim upon death the player drops a tombstone and useful death marker that points back to where you met your untimely end sometimes the trek back to your tombstone isnt a difficult one you might have been accidentally crushed by a falling tree a few steps from your base no problem you can run over and get your full inventory back in a few minutes on the other hand you might have fallen foul of one of valheims more intimidating monsters several miles from your home base
but like most survival games if you die in valheim you will lose everything no equipment your silver gear your trusty cape and no meads or other items this means the journey back to your tombstone is always going to be a difficult one particularly if you died many miles from your base it might be the case that you simply have to rebuild start afresh this is easier to stomach if the gear you dropped wasnt that rare or interesting but sometimes just getting back to basics is the best way to eventually retrieve your gear at a later date valheim is harsh you just have to roll with it but that is entirely up to you 


the biomes
the biomes in the game are tiered with some regions being harder than others and requiring you to get geared up before you adventure into them while that may sound repetitive it really isnt because the world is still procedurally generated and theres quite a bit to explore with your first few playthroughs i will say however that by the time you finish your first few playthroughs of the game the exploration probably wont be as exciting to you but im sure that will change soon considering the game is in early access


the crafting system
the crafting system is interesting as its not a traditional earn skills points and unlock skills instead youll be awarded new recipes for completing certain things or upgrading your workbench i kind of like it this way as it adds some mystery to the game and youre not sure what youll unlock next

the combat system
combat in valheim is remarkably simple and offers very little in terms of audiovisual feedback or player engagement which is pretty par for the course in the survival genrethe one thing i will say is theres a lack of a targeting action and swinging any of your weapons will drain your stamina quickly normally that wouldnt be a bad thing but some of the enemies are pretty jerky with their movements and like to constantly be on the move while fighting them making them quite annoying fights can take some patience to get used to but once you fight these enemies enough they can be fought with ease to an extent 

the game uses a parry combat system similar to dark souls or god of war and once you master it the fights in my opinion become much more fun as you come across bigger and better enemies such as the trolls in the black forest blocking their attacks becomes necessary because these guys will definitely murder you if you arent careful you can come at them with bows swords spears axes and some other weapons that are pretty impressive later on in the game depending on what you use your gameplay style will change

the leveling system
leveling in valheim is closer to games like romancing saga or the elder scrolls iv using a skill improves that skill want to increase your blocking skill strap on a shield and let things wail on you want to level woodcutting youll need to equip and axe and chop until you drop players have a huge variety of actions to do as well as you can tame animals such as wolves or practice agriculture cooking to prepare food mead and other items that can fill your stomach and boost your resistances and health is also quite important

building system
similar to ark survival evolved valheim uses a snapping based systemdesign when it comes to building at first it was a bit hard to work with and understand however the more i played it the more i came to appreciate how it works  you have full and absolute freedom for the most part of how you build your base for a game that isnt completely sandbox like minecraft or terraria with blocks that can be mined infinitely and in any order there is still a lot that you can do if you become creative enough there are simple items like floors walls pillars and more alike but you can rotate and combine them in unique ways to make your creation super cool all base building works off a stability system where if you dont have a solid foundation everything can start to fall and your house can collapse thus its important to focus on the quality of you

#####

as of 3182021 in early access

fantastic foundation to a game  all of the positive reviews are certainly warranted  however after 63 hours playing solo i have reached the end of the content currently in game  its clear there is more planned and content patches seem to roll out pretty regularly  that being said i plan to shelve the game for a year or two and pick it up again when its fully fleshed out  i kinda wish i had waited initially but it was a great run

do yourself a favor if you do get this game and do not look up _any_ spoilers  half of a game like this is figuring it out along the way

#####

if anyone ever says this game is boring they have no idea how insane this game truly is the hardest game i ever beat twice was dark souls 3 im not some hotshot badass never getting hit or something the game was hard as hell and you feel badass as hell by the end of dark souls 3 as if you just went on an epic unspoken journey that feeling right there is exactly how i feel about valheim after 1100 hours but even more satisfying than how i felt about dark souls 3 because this was more personal i cared about my living space i cared if the ground was shaking out the blue and something wanted to destroy the hard work i put into my homestead so i said screw it ive done everything circled the globe left my mark everywhere im gunna go live in the middle of the ocean and made an ocean platform spa  resort like a retirement home looking type of village lol away from past horrors so i can have some peace and quiet and feel like thanos at the end of infinity war now im in the endgame over here all running my hand through muh crops on my lovely farm im proud of in the middle of the ocean while i watch a gorgeous sunset on a grateful world rid of all of odins enemiesthat i killed alone

not gunna lie it honestly feels like i just went through war and have ptsd about what i went through id be like wide eyed looking at my hands being like ive seen sht man i couldve written a captivating full length damn diary for every ingame day like some viking soldier far from home waging war on odins enemies  writing back home the way forest gump would describe the sailing to jenny lmfao  i had no idea what i was about to go through i went in blind best way to go into anything in my opinion i was like oh god whats this next boss gunna look like nowjesus christ wtf is that without ever once using imacheater in the console command mainly cuz i couldnt lol i kinda needed to open the console menu to repair terrain from my first world from this one old patch long time ago but the button  nor any f1f5 work for some reason only f2 which does barely anything unless its some other button this whole damn time d its probably because i did some fullscreen command prompt in steam to force the game to launch in fullscreen and its been like that permanently for some reason even if i delete the prompt i put lol game always launched in border mode for some reason idfk thinking i wouldnt be able to notice but that was like 999hours ago idc anywho greatest gaming experience of my life right here still playing it too theres alot of room for expansion in the middle of the ocean lol oh and i swear i have played a couple games for sure xd

ninja edit so i finally figured out how to use console commands after 1k hours of playing i needed to put console in steams launch options for the game after opening the properties menu inside the steam libary and then f5 miraculously works im facepalming so hard rn

my friends were playing valheim and i was playing eso then three days ago they asked if i could host a valheim server so without further thought i researched how it worked and its similar to hosting minecraft but not nearly as complicated after buying the game for 25 cdn i set up the server created a subdomain did the necessary port forwards etc and got it up now at this point i havent even played the game yet so i had to log in test the remote and local domain ips and got it to all work within a couple of hours 

so far ive logged 455 hours and i feel a bit gross because i need to do work and blogging and chores i died so many times so many times 60 of the time was due to falling trees 30 of the time was due to hostiles 10 of the time was either i fell off a higher place or drowned or caught myself on fire good times

anyway i love the game however here are the positives and negatives so far

bpositivesb
 visuals look pretty storms out at sea and along the shore look awesome 
 physics not everyone is into it but i love it makes breaking things down much easier
 architectural physics yup its like a bridge building simulator youll need to build things that have support or they lose integrity and fall apart
 almost true survival the devs made it so there is a balance youre not going to have to worry about hunger and thirst constantly you just need to make sure to eat to full and watch your stamina while youre doing stuff some other reviewer complained that having stamina is antifun sounds like undeserved entitlement  i like the stamina function it gives the game a tactical feel hence survival regardless the more you use an ability the higher level you get and the higher level you get for that skill the more efficient you use your skills furthermore you lose 5 of your experience when you die that keeps you on your toes you cant just rush in and tank everything to death
 progression system you get new recipes for various items when you pick up associated items your civilisation also advances when you defeat a boss 

bnegativesb
 small personal inventory 300 units of weight is annoying you will basically tear down a small forest before you finish your medium sized house but you will keep running back and forth repeatedly unless you get some labourers to help you i am aware this can be increased by way of very tedious searching for a vendor in the black forest which makes it both fun and not fun 
 i dont know the exact key combo but running and jumping will yield in a midkick that stops you so if youre on autorun and you want to jump sometimes depending on what key youre holding down youre going to jump midkick and stop i have done this many times while being chased and need to jump over a barrier 
 wish there was a way to put one weapon and one shield always together pressing a key for torch then shield then sword then sometimes swap them out wrongly basically when i swap between a weapon and a hammer and press the unsheathe function it will unsheathe the hammer and shield i would like there to be specific slotsaction keys for unsheathing weapons
 save server ip my god i had to type this out for the first dozen times until i created a bat file to directly connect to the server
 workbench required to do basic stuff i mean if i have a hammer used to repair stuff why do i need a workbench too i understand i need a workbench for building stuff but repairing thats annoying my raft was almost broken and i couldnt repair it at sea why makes no sense 
 torches wont give me warmth on the mountain or in rain but should give me personal warmth while carrying it at night in neutral weather 
 missing halfsized items its not missing per se but the devs made small 1x1 floor and 1x2 wall panels why not make the same for half sized diagonal beams horizontallyhalvedsized walls and vertical ladders instead of diagonal ladders

bideasb
 tamable mounts please they have hp require sustenance and can carry a small amount of stuff based on its size and strength they also have basic skills like jumping running ramming tail swipe etc  depending on the type of creature
 more creature types like bears scary things and snakes also flying creatures would be amazing more sea creatures would be great too 
 how about sand pits might go to hidden caches or underground areas 
 how about danger sense ability to notice something nearby with an onscreen warning as well as a dot on the minimap maybe yellow for passives and orange for hostiles perhaps the more times something gets near you the more efficient it gets or perhaps through fighting them not sure how to level up this
 serverside cfg file or options that allow variations of play eg turn offon x weather type is # land generation seed is # force disable player pvp share world map etc

bthoughts about new hh updateb

i enjoy the new food system i dont understand why some people think its more tedious or that it sucks i think it makes individual foods more interesting to use perhaps to cater to the people who hate the food system so much that they would resort to calling the devs uncaring and think the game is dead its far from dead no one on our 9 person server has said anything bad about the update the devs could make it so there are settings for each new game world start eg turn offon features eg food buffs onoff sailing wind mechanics onoff etc i think its stupid that people are crying about a survival game having survival elements but i guess i also have to accept there are other view points than my own so there is my suggestion for a compromise 

also the devs are far from uncaring just because they didnt do everything under the sun to appease you it doesnt mean they dont care it means they dont look at you as the one and only special snowflake that needs special attention 

#####

damn if you are new you should visit the plains so much free stuff man

#####

this game is what i wanted minecraft to be 12 years ago i loved it playing it solo i can assure you that if you play this with some friends you are going to love it more than i did

valheim mosquitoes are built different

#####

this game is the one if you are looking for something that combines ark wow minecraft and more this is where you need to be 
i hate giving one sided reviews so now i have to complain as a female player i really need my long viking hair to show when i have head gear on
buy this game i can not even imagine how much this game will grow and continue to amaze me if it is this good already you cant lose

#####

this game is absolutely incredible the devs are allowing you to rob them by being able to buy this game for only 20 there is an absurd amount of content in this game for only being an early access the term early access has been plagued by other haphazardly thrown together titles but valheim is certainly not one of them 

player movement and controls feel very responsive while still having weight to certain actions the combat system has more depth to it than similar survival titles with mechanics like dodgerolling and parrying that dont feel clunky to pull off itemloot progression pacing is nice its slow enough so that you definitely value your new upgrades but is also quick enough so that you dont feel like youve been stuck in the stone age your whole playthrough the construction system is probably my new favorite of this genre its complex enough so that players can build masterpieces while also being simple enough to put together a shitshack on the fly 

the world looks incredible and is procedurally generated with a lot of things to discover old crumbling buildings camps etc the map is also absolutely massive and getting around to the different biomes takes some time so making multiple campssettlements is something a player can expect to be doing to add to getting around the map you can build boats to cross some of the larger bodies of water the boats feel very good even in multiplayer typically having more than one player on top of a dinky raft in other games causes them to bug out and flip upside down or explode but not here having more than one player on a boat is surprisingly smooth sailing 

on the topic of bugs in the 11 hours of playing this game in a multiplayer session so far i have not encountered any bugsplayer desync or crashes  edit having more than 56 players in close proximity can cause the server to lag whether its p2p or dedicated also having multiple fire sources that produce smoke in one area can chunk your fps

this is a must buy game for viking mythology and survival game enthusiasts looking forward to seeing the new content added to an already solid game


#####

unfortunately there is no way for me to give this game an objective review because it ties in so intricately with the mental health issues i was experiencing at the height of my dozens maybe hundreds of solo plays

sure i occasionally played in groups with amazing wonderful friends that i knew id say maybe 500 hours or so was spent with company

but the most impactful moments for me were on a boat alone sailing across the ocean problemsolving aggrod 2star wolves jumping offship or in the plains suddenly hearing fuling laughter behind me while i dug lox pits for hours or wondering what legitimately lay over the edge of the world when no one had details about it in the beginning and then finding outand in hindsight thinking oh maybe i shouldnt have been fullydecked in my good gear when i did that womp womp

the journey is never so palpable in your soul until you can feel each step done by yourself for yourself

maybe ill rewrite this review later to be more succinct or give more technical detail of the actual game but its going to be difficult for me to separate something thats so incredibly changed the space inside of me and made it so much bigger so much fuller and so much more whole

#####

awesome game however for future updates please stop feeding us with images of whats to come and just release it we would like to explore these new biomes by ourselves without seeing every single thing thats being added

#####

this game feels like minecraft and skyrim had a baby i like it

#####

never liked survival games never liked construction games never had the patient for exploration games never liked open word games where i have to walk miles to get anywherethis game as it all and i loved and im addicted why ive no freaking idea 1010

#####

viking minecraft for big bois enuff said

#####

chopping trees in this game is an orgasmic experience

#####

great early access game no reason to wait for it to officially release because it already feels like a finished game you can get countless hours of enjoyment i personally cant wait for the rest of the content to be released but with 500 hours in i already got my moneys worth seriously this game should have won goty all over when its officially released look out

im going to be very honest the game has been reviewed thousands of times and theres not much i can add to that however it is the lets review for a badge time and im not one to be left out

that all said i gave this the better with friends award im not sure i would have lasted this long without my friends and a special someone its a hard game no doubt and labourious but with others its a blast

if that sounds like your sort of thing pick it up

#####

i figured hitting four figures would be a good time to review except for short periods of breaks i have consistently played this game for the best part of a year it is just such a chill game when i want it to be or more challenging when i want that generally building and prepping for building is whats taken up my time and its been a good time i expect to easily double this time or more

#####

valheim is a jack of all trades master of none type of survival game almost every aspect of the game i can think of to enjoy has already been done and done better by a lot of games but this is the only game i can think of that does all of them

if you want to mine to get armor to kill a boss so that you can get access to better armor to kill a harder boss and rinse and repeat until you reach the endgame terraria has far more content 

if you want to build a fortress and defend it against periodic waves of enemies 7 days to die might suit you better 

if you want to flex your creative skills and make a beautiful base games like minecraft would give you more freedom or even fallout 4 if you prefer buildings that lock to grids

if you enjoy the numbers go up satisfaction of mmo progression systems as you use a skill without just playing an mmo 7 days to die and project zomboid have similar do thing get better at it systems

if you enjoy growing crops and farming stardew valley would be more to your liking than the farming in this game

if you enjoy the combat system of stamina management parrying and dodge rolling i shouldnt need to mention the existence of literally any fromsoft game like dark souls or bloodborne especially with elden ring just around the corner

but as much as it seems like im making a negative review telling you to play any other game the point is that valheim has a little bit of them all 

if you intend to buy this game and play with friends i think its a great game if you want to play solo and have no intention of playing with others i would look elsewhere the game lacks the kind of depth and complexity to make it a good solo survival game in my opinion but its fantastic as a casual easy to pick up survival game to mess around with friends in

#####

deathsquitos

#####

great game sadly  not much when u defeat all boses is left to do and desire to play goes down 

#####

im going to have to move back in with my parents maintaining my lands on valheim has made holding down a full time job logistically impossible additionally doing my own laundry is a drag

#####

they made grinding boar kills in the forest fun again

#####

see that guy that mentioned valheim destroying your sleeping schedule yeah he wasnt lying

#####

viking used to suffer a lot with the grind and now you can feel it too

#####

after 160 hrs of solo playing and a year pause im back to this game and play with my wife i wanna tell the devs that i support them and trust in their work its time for this early access game to show all its potential

#####

growing up you dont have many more nostalgic gaming experiences like you did as a kid playing this game for a week straight with my friends was the closest i got to that feeling such a great game highly recommend

#####

valheim is an amazing game for firsttimers but coming back to do it again is not the most thrilling experience ever

just to let the reader know ive played every single minute of the game with 2 or 3 players no solo experience

first time opening the game is quite astonishing you and your buddy sitting there thinking holy crap i dont know anything about this game the game just drops you in and you have to figure it out yourself so you do some exploring and think everything is super deadly you are scared finally you start figuring out what kills you in the first biome and what doesnt so you plan it out gather some resources and build a base 
suddenly you feel like the biggest warlord ever and decide to venture to the black forest being the boss you are you experiment a little bit and try to fight a little bit bigger enemies guess what the great warlord gets slain easily so you are there with nothing again and now you run back to get ur stuff you are extremely careful and find the next biome the swamp now you know everything kills you quick so you take your time and carefully plan out every step but guess what draugr kills you the first time he has the chance and so on with the mountain and the plains everything kills you but you learn from it and plan out ur moves

long story short the game is really unforgiving you mostly build your base and grind all the time for food and supplies to make better armour then you can venture into the more dangerous biomes and get even better stuff from there risk loot reward type of game

i am not gonna list anything good anymore as most of the other reviews will tell you that anyways ill talk more closely about the bad stuff in the game keep in mind that this review is made in the starting lifetime of the hearth  home update

the game is super grindy i know that the new update fixed it a little bit but you gotta maintain your food so much and to expand ur base you really gotta grind those materials 1 hour of building a base equals to 35 hours of grinding everything you need for it not for people who enjoy short bursts of gameplay 

to be fair the game is really good the first time you play it youll have so much new stuff to do and explore but atleast for me trying out the game for the second time is a chore i really hoped that the new update would fix it but sadly no expecially the first 34 biomes are really repetitive and boring the developers have really added quite nothing new to the world yes we have some little updates to the building and food types but the world is still the same and once you know what is in the biome it becomes boring quite fast i was hoping that the meadows and the black forest would get much needed attention on enemy types maybe some new animals trees villages or enemy camps sadly none of it is there considering how much the game was hyped at the start and how many people actually bought the game i hoped that the valheim development team would expand and focus 100 into developing the game even further they definitely have the resources now i cannot see it at this moment the ocean one of the main things of vikings is empty as a soulless ghost 

i am not speaking for everyone but only for me for me the conclusion is it is not worth the time if you are starting again from the beginning after playing 100 hours straight the last period the enjoyment isnt there there really is nothing new to explore and exploration is the part that keeps the game interesting 

but if you decide to buy the game having never played it before i recommend it 100 as it is so much fun the first time youll really get addicted but eventually youll know everything there is to know and then it sadly fades out for me it happened like 80 hours in so still pretty good

710  i would give it a 10 if the new update would have focused on exploration part more expecially the starting exploration meadows black forest ocean swamp 

sadly im disappointed  


#####

best 20 ive spent on steam

#####

i have about 350 hours in this game

i absolutely love and hate this game at the same time let me explain to you why

i love it for building housesbases only your imagination sets the limit and the actual limit of the materials used
the meadows biome is peaceful the black forest is slightly more difficult but quickly becomes comfortable once you get the hang of smashing skeletons and other creatures to pieces trolls can be kited with a bow and fire arrows
once you kill elder everything changes though the swamp biome is absolutely horrible bonemass is largely agreed by the player base to be the hardest boss in the game 

when you work so hard to progress and finally feel like youre getting somewhere then you make a karve and start exploring and lose everything you have because you worked so hard it means a lot more

bottomline is that this game is brutal you will die alot the lesson here is that you can always rebuild even when you lost everything once you get past where you got stuck the dopamine high is absolutely insane  which is why i keep coming back to this game even after i rage quit 

i give this game 1010 because the riskreward balance is very satisfying sometimes you get lucky most of the time you will die thats the way it goes

one thing i wish is that it would be easier to join other players ive really only played this game alone

#####

pretty cool and one of a kind survival game but after a 3 year break i came back to find that there was only 1 new biome and a couple new bad guys added to the game  the development speed has been painstakingly slow even for an indie studio  ill try again in 2030 i guess

h1 the gist of the story h1

our character was recently slain in battle their soul is sent to a purgatory realm called valheim where they can battle some more treacherous foes and then die some more because they didnt wear pants during a battle true story you are tasked with hunting down odins enemies and bringing peace to valheim 
 
h1 gameplay h1

by odins balls this game is good the game acts like a survival game with building crafting without the nonsense of incessant hunger thirst or sleepy meters bothering you at every corner there is a hunger meter but thats linked mostly to your health and stamina the higher quality of food you eat the more stamina andor health you receive each food item you cook or find has a duration so its effect will fade as time passes you can eat three different types of nourishment at once there is no hp drain if you dont eat unless a troll breaks your house and curb stombs you while youre in it you die in that case when death greets you you drop your items in a form of a tombstone sort of like a bloodstain from souls games but whats great in valheim is that your map tells you where you died and there doesnt seem to be an expiration date so your precious iron and gear will wait for you  

the combat i would say is pretty solid there is a variety of weapons you can choose from swords shields spears axes hammers bows torch each with its own moveset i normally select thrusting weapons so i chose the spear at first but the moveset has such short range for a spear that i roll with a sword there is a block and parry mechanic if you manage to parry correctly block at the last second of the attack you can stagger the enemy and damage them for a critical damage make sure you gear up because if your equipment isnt up to par you will melt 

you will level up your stats constantly lets say if you are running you will improve stamina drain if youre mining with your pickaxe youll increase its damage it reminds me of the elder scrolls system oblivion and skyrim where you naturally increase your skills the more you use them 

valheim also has a heavy emphasis on exploration youll start with your underwear but as you become stronger youll be able to explore each new region more comfortably without worrying about a giant troll rushing towards you with a grin on its face i am about 70 hours in and i know i havent seen everything the game encourages you to explore and search for superior resources to outfit your viking or the location of the next boss when you find a boss arena youll have to hunt for items in the boss region that allow you to summon the boss build a ship and sail to an unknown land the sailing somewhat reminds me of windwaker just an open sea with you and your red lion kingok thats not in this game but i wonder if modding can make it happen one day 

lastly if you dont want to explore on your own join the valheim discord server or visit the steam community and youll find other vikings to play with just be careful about griefers in the servers i play solo for the most part that way all the resources in the world are mine and mine alone i have played with a few folks though there are so many creative players out there its amazing to witness how they construct their headquarters and handle the challenges of the game their own way

valheim is a very special game let me tell you why

 it looks like shit and gorgeous at the same time

 it is chill  calming and super intense at the same time

 it is very easy and very difficult at the same time

 it is so simple yet crazy complex at the same time

and you can see and agree how these are so only after youve played it

#####

with about 850 hours in the game i guess its time to review it everything youve heard about valheim is true and more than that its also very wrong if you dont approach it in a way that makes the most of it the way you like it with friends during lockdowns on a dedicated server or shared local world to rebuild or just renovate the house of your family or dreams or travel or hunt fish plant hike sail cook decorate indulge in combat or magic gather and horde craft without talents its not a fast game its one that slows you down its probably not a game for anime lovers mobile game lootbox collectors wallrunners xray vision or tower defense minimaxers elite samurai or solitaire experts but its likely the most casual game in my collection that i tend to return to when other games are too challenging it might be the game you talk about when asked what you did to survive the pandemic back in the day

#####

wow where to start guess at the beginning

this game is a coop survival game with an emphasis on pve the world is dangerous af and you and your group need to work together to survive waves of enemies as you progress with your base building this game is heavy on the exploration aspect not once have i been bored wandering around the randomly generated maps of valheim graphics are simple yet i find myself marveling at the lighting and environmental effects around me a soft breeze blowing through the trees the clouds moving in the sky a sunset or sunrise all are beautiful in game crafting is what youd expect but surprisingly fun and deep and leveling is based on what you are doing in game building is easy and seemless and i have so much fun making viking style long houses there is naval travel and longboat to build dungeons to raid and bosses to fight a wonderful game i think any avid fan of open world survival should play this game 1010

best 20 ive ever spent

why are the majority of very beautiful locations just on the edge of the dark forest or other wilder areas
i found a nice spot at the top of a high steep and also walkable slope where a beautiful green plain was bordered with forests with green flora rocks and also a side where a snow area begins 
all this with the beautiful view from the edge of the slope

besides the only missing detail water this place was the perfect place to build my camp  possible settlement 
it doesnt compare to an uninhabited and dilapidated village that i found close to the sea

in the first modest cabin i already had 5 full boxes with valuable items outside a bbq made of wood and stones and next to it some hives for that fresh sweet honey sauce with my wild boar meat

i was almost preparing to demarcate small areas for planting seeds for certain fruits but then when i started cutting very innocent fresh wood suddenly a couple of wolves and also a blue giant troll came sniffing around their new neighbor and this fell not in their taste

i had to flee from the wolves and luckily they were a little further distracted from some deer they apparently found much more interesting
on my return to my cozy cabin i saw that this troll was destroying my nest a whole corner and edge had been smashed to pieces my bbq was gone but luckily the bees were unharmed which i couldnt say about 1 storage box 

to this day i still defend that place over and over with my life and as far as my explorations have taken me that place is still worth dying for over and over again

the eternal fight 
my little valhalla





in my opinion valheim is a very entertaining constructive survival game
few games of this genre really kept me glued to the screen but valheim hit it 100 

the start is always some sorting out and patiently butchering animals for their valuable items  collect enough items to build or craft other necessary things and once you are settled you are ready to explore this mega huge open world

the building and craft system is very easy to master although the things you want to work towards depend on your view of the options you have and also your creativity
valheim offers a lot of possibilities in this area you will also have to upgrade items and the workbench to be able to build more things 
so you start with making wooden huts to possibly a full stone castle or city  cities with possible ports for the boats and ships that you will make

the vehicles for sailing are also necessary to explore the rest of the world they are not difficult to operate at all but keep in mind the direction of the wind or it could be a long journey

online in valheim you can play together with up to 10 people in 1 server this brings more fun to building a city exploring or fighting with the so many monsters that valheim has hidden within by the way try not to stand with too many people on 1 raft no doubt some will fall into the water

in addition to the many enemies this world also has many dungeons hidden in the dark forest for example you will often see these locations guarded with some enemies that are in those dungeons in these dungeons you will often find unique items at least if you stay alive that is
monsters are also often tied to specific locations for example you will encounter wolves in snow areas or monsters in other areas this makes things a little bit easier if you are specifically hunting something

besides lively monsters and beasts in the open world you will also have to defeat special enemies such as when you make an offering on an offering table
these enemies are very cool and also very challenging to fight of course they are not that easy with patience you can usually handle them alone but of course it is better to fight them in a group just like a group against a giant troll is much more effective than if you need 5 bows  800 arrows and 4 spears to defeat a troll on your own if you also kill the shamans who come to heal the trolls in time

when you die you will lose all your gear and skills but you can get it all back by returning to the spot highlighted via an icon on the map and radar
if you get there you will get everything back
if you hang around in the water for too long you will also lose hp due to the automatically decreasing stamina meter if you do not get out of the water in time you die im not really a fan of this last part vikings are hardcore and they cant swim too long or it becomes deadly i suppose this is for a reason of encouraging the players to sail but i honestly think that players will choose sailing more often than long distance swimming even if it was possible to swim long and stay alive

valheim has a lot to offer and from the first hour you play you realize that you have been made curious
you look at the map and zoom out and you are speechless
the world is very beautiful the visual effects of nature with accompanying sounds create a perfect ambient atmosphere

definitely a game where you can invest an incredible amount of time and experience new things for a very long time

i missed the initial hype wave when valheim initially came out in february of 2021 i didnt get a chance to start playing until pretty much a year later now that the hype has died down and reality has set in i can still comfortably say that valheim was robbed of goty for 2021 the gameplay is solid and addictive what initially feels like an obtuse take on stamina management becomes a masterclass on how to make enjoyable repetitive gameplay in the modern era the combat of valheim is difficult but fair the eating mechanic allows you to remain fed on minimal food while not making the game impossible without constant farminghunting the way that health and stamina is attached to how good your food is not only leans into the viking storytelling of the game but makes the gameplay loop all the more enjoyable the boss fights are fun and engaging with the bow gameplay especially being quite good the progression system in place as it stands now is relatively uninspired feeling like what terraria did first over a decade prior yet iron gate took a system that is known to work and ran with it i cant say i love how an otherwise open world game is constantly gated by your progression but it certainly does not hamper enjoyment of the game in any meaningful way the building system is awesome reminiscent of rust but in a good game the resource gathering loop is fun especially when you have to travel great distances from your base to get something the sailing is incredible for a game with already so much going for it the fact that the game released in ea with such a solid combat system eatingfood mechanic building system and a sailing simulation worthy of a aaa title is just incredible the graphics are certainly a nostalgia bait but nonetheless look incredible especially when you take into account how well the lighting is managed in the game the sound effects and music are good but nothing incredible overall graphically and performance wise the game is more than solid valheim truly is the complete package  do not let early access scare you away here get yourself some friends and become vikings the game is really as good as the hype says it is

#####

incredible game 500 hours in and i can still come back to this game and enjoy it however this game has been in early access for a long period of time covid did have a part to play with staffing problems but i cant help but feel at this point that its taking way to long for the game to finish the loyal fans wait and wait and wait for new content to come out and when it does the release of that content doesnt feel like enough to satisfy the amount of time you waited for it started getting the feeling awhile ago that the developers made all the money without actually needing to fully release this game and now they have just forgot about it as a loyal fan i respect the development team for making sure the updates wont just be fluff but at this point how much longer must we wait

#####

h1my strongest recommendation ever on steam read if youre unsure about playingh1

blet me preface my rating by pointing out that im not some hardcore buildingcrafting type gamerb i played minecraft like most people but i never reached endgame because i just found the world kind of too easy and rather boring im also pretty bad at buildingdecoration so without the game im still talking about minecraft having much substance outside of buildingcraftinggathering i found myself quickly bored

benter valheimb

put simply this game looks amazing feels amazing and has so many layers of substance 

bthe combat is surprisingly complex and funb you would think its rather basic but its not while the combat itself consists of blocking parrying dodging special attacks and whacking monsters until theyre dead it is surprisingly nuanced and challenging the environment alone makes every fight feel uniquedistinct from the other fortifying your base and using it to your advantage to overcome raids feels surprisingly good making giant monsters like trolls and abominations navigate around trees while you juke  weave between them and fire off arrows is also extremely satisfying

band then theres the building and the craftingb somehow even this feels good to me despite what i said above as you progress through the game and gather materials you unlock the ability to craft better gear cook better food and brew potions this is not just a means of getting stronger this is a necessity for your progression and survival as well as the only way to fell the games various bosses 

for example when discovering the swamps i was getting 1shotted by 2star archers despite spending hours and hours upgrading my food  armor to the point where i could easily kill trolls  survive the black forest because of this i had ireal incentivei to weather the crypts in order to find iron and upgrade to a full set of iron armor while doing so was terrifying and dangerous i managed to overcome it and now i can march through the swamps like a boss im currently finishing upgrading my iron armor so i can take on the next world boss bonemass

bnever in a video game have i felt such a rewarding and balanced sense of progressionb never have i actually had bfunb building and fortifying in various locations never have i felt such real terror and sense of danger and despite this danger the game is extremely fair preparation is half the battle and if you plan work hard and take your time you can make every challenge much easier but still be given a run for your money and the best part none of this feels dull at all none of it feels like grinding

bthis is valheim in a nutshell you will truly feel like youre surviving in a barren dangerous worldb over time you will carve out huge portions of said word and make it your own you will slowly become stronger faster wiser making smarter decisions and devising various strategies to handle the huge range of dangerous scenarios you can encounter 

byou will eventually realize that exploring your starter island is not enough for progression so youll build a ship and make your way out to the open sea to find new land  biomes everything every single item you can create has a purpose none of it is a gimmickb

this game is incredible whether youre playing solo or with others and the best part is its not even done yet this earlyaccess title has more depth and content than the vast majority of aaa games and at 20 it is a goddamned steal you will get every pennys worth i honestly cant think of a single bad thing to say about it im only 118 hours in and its an easy 55 stars

#####

fun for a while with friends youll explore build and repeat the process  thats about it  no story quests npcs just environments  loads of farming and a handful of bosses that arent very remarkable  i had a lot of fun creating some detailed builds but after a while that being the only thing to do becomes mundane  give it a shot if you have some friends to adventure with but dont expect too much

#####

its strange i have never enjoyed a coop game with friends as much as i enjoyed valheim the experience is quite different from other survival open world games the closest thing i can compare it to is minecraft but that game does not enforce cooperation between players as much as valheim does i think this deserves a bit of elaboration
instead of being built of small bits cubes or other geometrical figures that are modified and carved by the players valheims world can be perceived as a big foundation upon which players can build their own creations this foundational pillar imposes the impression of magnificency and intimidates you as the player a viking with nothing but some ragged clothes and it does it every time you load up a new character and a new world this is something that no survival game has made me feel ever
this intimidating feeling does not impede you from playing the game rather it gives you a hint as to how this game should be approached going berserk on your enemies is a sure way to bring valhalla upon yourself this is even more subjective than this entire critique but i dont think valheim enforces that style of gameplay instead the game promotes curiosity as your best survival tool this curiosity a simple abstract concept transmutes into exploration which in turn allows you to obtain hints as to what you should do how you should do it which places you should explore and which you should avoid
how does valheim enforce cooperation simple combat and exploration again the combat system in this game is not remarkable in any way it offers quite a lot of offers to approach combat however you like whether you want to be an archer a warrior with a small shield a stealthy assassin or a tank the game offers items for you what makes it interesting is that enemies health and damage scale with the amount of players near them thus if a troll decides to follow you to your base and your friend nearby doing something else you will both need to cooperate to kill it before it wreaks havoc this is simple and efficient on the other hand regarding exploration its obviously better to go to a new area with someone covering your back i will simply say this to not spoil do bnotb go into the ocean alone bring a friend with you
having played over 100 hours i never finished the game this is because i preferred playing with friends than playing alone even though i enjoyed the latter quite a bunch this leads to the only negative commentary i want to make about valheim and quite an unremarkable one at that on a single sentence the games progression is hindered by its crafting requirements i believe this to be a problem that originates as a combination of factors first the idea that the progression curve should be linear what is curious is that the game itself gives this impression the first tiers of equipment are not hard to obtain by simply exploring and setting up your camp or base in a way that feels quite passive but once you reach the iron age you could even argue that it actually starts at the bronze age the game becomes extremely slow because of the amount of grinding that you have to do i believe this is one of the main causes of the sheer amount of mods that allow you to teleport metal through portals otherwise nearly half of the gameplay is just spent crossing the ocean i love sailing in this game by the way but my friends and i couldnt stand having to play for 3 hours 2 of which are almost afk aboard a ship just to make a full iron setup for only one of us you could argue that this could be optimized by having each player sail alone searching for crypts but that goes against the essence of multiplayer gameplay and is simply not fun iron gear costs are too inflated and i believe this extends to the following tiers this is a shame but luckily it can be fixed easily either by changing the recipes in the game or allowing mods to modify recipes
valheim is a beautiful game with a huge potential to become one of the best survival exploration open world games to ever exist i recommend you support the creators of this game a small team of developers with a notable passion for their game so that the game can continue to grow

my mother told me
some day i would buy
galley with good oars
and sail to distant shores


#####

watch out for falling trees

#####

i like this game a lot i recommend for anyone who likes building because valheim has a very intricate building system compared to other survival games i have played in the past the game can be stressful at times but then very peaceful at others which is nice so i can play either way depending on my mood the music in this game is godly and is lovely to hear while i run around collecting berries and mushrooms for hours on end i love the designs of the bosses a lot and the mobs in general the art is beautiful overall a great game imo d

ive had such a great time playing valheim with my friends i absolutely recommend you group up some friends and experience this game together playing multiplayer is probably best with a dedicated server solo gameplay is also satisfying although i think this games shines in multiplayer

my group built a small modest home early on in our playthrough watching it blossom over time into a village with decorated stylish structures with endgame gear was a real treat there is a small story for every place weve been every building weve built and every piece of gear we crafted the exploration component can have you sweating sometimes as that is when the most risk is involved it was thrilling to embark out to sea for the first time in the search for new lands the building mechanics in this game are a blast and you can design and create some amazing looking structures if you are creative or have a guide to follow i appreciate the aesthetic of the viking longhouses many folks have built further the crafting and cooking system is extensive and you genuinely feel like you earned that iron armor or serpent stew after a grueling adventure

great game worth the price new content on the horizon is also a plus get it

#####

i bought threecourse dinner first dish was quite nice i admit but cook went missing and kitchen seems cold and abandoned should i be worried yes waiter had given me some water but im still hungry im starting to get nervous maybe i just got cheated on guy sitting at the next table is shouting at me that i should be glad they gave me the first dish im worried guys i think this restaurant isnt a good one

bh1unity update  karma bitch hahahah1b 

h1bno game developer is forced to finish their game they can stop development at any time or they can release an update and say its finished now  it doesnt matterbh1

game is bland mod support is the current lifeline since the devs write a single line of code per month

devs begging steamhub mods to purge every thread saying anything negative about the game they made a megathread where they ask you to put your negative opinions instead of writing a negative review but all they do in that thread is ban people for criticizing the painfully slow development

literally asking people to post in a megathread instead of making a negative review so they can ban you and keep negative opinions at a minimum removing this game from my library i have no interest in supporting these devs or playing their steaming pile of shit

edit mod made a comment comparing the development process to that of dayzs and that even though the game is early access the devs are not obligated to continue further development responded by making my own comparison between valheim and dayznmsthe forest and got banned for making offtopic posts putting the mods post and my reply here since this was a genuinely good reply in a thread designed for feedback like this

edit again lol rantvent thread has been removed as there was too much criticism and negative feedback the devs were clearly expecting people to praise them in that thread and rant about people asking for updates _ツ_

quotedumbassto clarify a few things intention is not promise further it is recommended to not communicate any future of the game to customers simply because it may or may not be realized and customers should be buying the game based on its current status

bno game developer is forced to finish their game they can stop development at any time or they can release an update and say its finished now  it doesnt matterb

this is actually nothing uncommon dayz for example graduated from quite far away of 10 out of early access simply because of internal changes of the development team and plans such a decision also comes with lots of marketing strategies

wed like to focus this thread on valheim this thread was not made to discuss what early access meansquote


quotemethis has got to be the most delusional thing ive ever seen

hello games kept quiet for example because their game was not early access on release they stayed quiet while they made the game they promised then they proceeded to release a myriad of banger updates what ig has teased is barely anything for the amount of time theyve taken to make progress

endnight games had weekly updates for the forest during early access and slowed down significantly upon leaving early access there is almost nothing in common between how eg and ig handled their ea titles other than they both started in early access

you use dayz as an example which is regarded as one of if not the worst example of how to handle a game in early access much like valheim it only stayed moderately relevant due to the modding community again much like valheim supporters of the game grew increasingly annoyed and impatient with the devs who refused to communicate with their community excusing poor communication by saying its early access is one of the reasons why the ea system is terrible then to back up what youre saying with

no game developer is forced to finish their game they can stop development at any time or they can release an update and say its finished now  it doesnt matter

has got to be the most absurd thing ive ever read about an early access title you are literally describing the exact thing that has been annoying steam users since the greenlight days yeah devs dont have to finish their game they got enough money on release so they can just dip bro all youve done is describe what a cash grab is

the amount of people getting banned in this thread and this community hub in general is pretty telling how are you going to make a statement like yours then tell people they arent allowed to make a rebuttal genuinely childish cant wait for two people to see this comment before it also gets torchedquote

and i want to make it clear to anyone reading this that the devs comment is in response to previous comments that they first deleted before addressing people were talking about the concept of early access and how ig is handling their game and the mod deleted the posts and made their own which you arent allowed to reply to of course my reply got me a 7day ban from the discussions i wasnt banned for calling the mod delusional for saying his opinion is absurd for any kind of toxicity at all it was for derailing the rantvent thread by ranting about the game

#####

pro love the game can highly recommend it please scroll to the last sentece i wrote it sums the current state up

con dont buy into promises of things to come theyre approaching with the speed of the next ice age

community thoughts most voiced and voted everytime something got posted
we love the game
hire more developers
more content pls stop sleeping

my thoughts on why
the game released with a roadmap in 02022021 roadmap one day after the release 
it received unprecedented love and exploded in popularity it was a ea game that was good and lockdowns were a windfall for valheim
it even achieved a game of the year award by pc gamer we are truly living in interesting times when a ea game can receive that award

every new milestone got posted
10022021 1 million players
26022021 2 million players
19022021 3 million players
24022021 4 million players
03032021 5 million players
interspersed with quiete a lot of bug fixes since with the massive player numbers of the ea game gave the devs quite a lot of bug hunters
25022021
26202021
02032021
23032021
29032021
19042021
12052021
09062021

but as we can see the time inbetween got larger but the quality and quality stagnated
meanwhile we got development news
19032021  here is us the developers
23042021  we changed the skin of one mob as well as two teaser pictures on two items to come
21052021  we bought donated a pony

this is also the first post that received backlash as with increasing sales expectations grew yet time inbetween releases read patch notes did too instead of news on the roadmap fulfillment the community was treated to a picture of a horse

15062021  announcement that the promised updates will be delayed the first is expected to come in q3 2021 its the first time people get unhappy with the delays in updates as they realized the roardmap might be unrealistic at the current pace

and it did on the 17092021 they released the first major update of the promised 4 in 2021
it was good but the expectations were higher especially considering the huge delays and swell in sales common thought was to hire more devs to expand the game and sell even more copies of the game keep this thought in the back of your mind

22102021  we got treated to a filler and a concept art picture
24112021  is valheim your game of the year please vote interesting times we live in
25112021  one new armor set and 2 concept art pictures got released shame on you for thinking this might be anything else but lucky timing to be released one day after the post of the goty mention
17122021  happy holidays valheim community post
22122021  please vote for us as goty

some think valheim being nominated for a goty award could set a bad pecedent and the three top post on the first page reflect this ill leave this up to the individual

02020222  its been a year since launch and valheim has released one out of four updates we get a picture of a corridor from a potential future dungeon as well as a concept art of a new mob the interesting shift in this post is also towards the community in the form of showing buildings that player have built in the game with hindsight very telling is that irongate will focus to ensure valheim will run smoothly on steamdeck awesome but what about the promised updates

01032022  a roadmap goal is renamed and this is it interestingly enough they show concept art instead of ingame footage
25032022  we show how an item a bow is created from concept art in blender also the game is steamdeck verified
 
since then the post have gotten fewer  quieter and the comments demanding for more updates instead of bug fixes have increased in strenght

the feedback 11082022  was so negative that discussion and comments are no longer enabled large portions of the community are veryh upset the sales were windfall of epic proportions the preceived development in turn seemed to have slowed in similar proportions
 
and i can understand the community showing a blender construceted mob a hare and item a bow seems impressive but underwhelming when considering the the timeframe and the amount of qol and game improvements modders have introduced in the same timeframe or even pure number of items modders have created suddenly reskined items seem far less impressive

especially upsetting is if you think that comment got disabled just about the time they announce to focus on crossplatform compatibiliy instead of finishing the game on the main platform pc first the community still waits on the fullfillment of the promise of the last 2 updates while the team focuses on new platforms that are not that upset yet instead of furthering development on the main platform

some me compare it to no mans sky of the indie world except nms hired more devs and cranked out gameplay update after gameplay update after a long silence valheim could not keep quiet about how great they felt but cranked out nigh nothing instead of hiring more staff

both promised more than they delivered 
one buckled down an kept stiocially quiet took the blows and then delivered
one exhilareted in how great they felt and how thankful they were but lagged in devlivering and when the blows came they silencerd the community

#####

adventure what adventure base building

okay heres the thing

i fucking love this game i got hooked from day one and got a decent amount of my friends to play alongside with me building a main settlement with the boys going out and exploring the procedurally generated landscapes to see what cool sights there are to see and where to set up more settlements in wicked cool areas working together to take down big baddies and bosses
obviously we know that with early access games we expect an unfinished product that should hopefully continue to progress and include even more stellar content held to the same standard as to what the game currently has to offer and yes i expected there to be a long amount of time needed to polish the rough edges and to fill the game with more riveting content

but game devs guys i know youre probably overwhelmed with the massive amount of praise and players that poured into the game from release but the speed in which content is coming out is so soooo soooo unbelievably slow remember that 2021 roadmap that was posted like 500 days ago ya know showcasing their planned updates
update 1 hearth and home
update 2 cult of the wolf
update 3 ships and sea
update 4 mistlands
now of course this isnt paramount but its what they decided to present to the players and fans for this game back then

id generally consider myself a pretty patient guy but dude hearth and home came out literally over a year ago at the time of writing this and then cult of the wolf sort of dropped i guess but it was small forgettable and not at all up to the same volume of content hh gave us so im not really sure what to think there but what i can tell you is that this game has gone from a sprint to a walk and then ultimately to an immeasurably slow crawl i dont want to burn myself out on this really fun game so i like to start a new world and character every time one of these major updates come out to experience the game again with more content included to sweeten up every new journey through the game more and more ive been really itching to play through again but i have no real reason to until there are some significant additionschanges that will make my next playthrough more magical than all of my previous playthroughs like the mistlands update or the ships and the sea update which has apparently been skipped in preference for mistlands which would be fine if we werent all still sitting here over a year later waiting for something significant to be added to the game after they very clearly have the budget at this point after the huge success of the game from launch and even after expanding their team to speed up the development

im probably coming across as overly salty or being unreasonable and i dont want to deter anybody from playing the game in its current state if you have yet to experience valheim youll probably love it but for those of us who have sunk hundreds of hours into it eager for more the progression of the game is just not satisfying that thirst for more like at all i understand these things take time but holy hell this is a loooot of time to not even come close to delivering on not even half of the roadmaps content

so yes i recommend it for the people who havent played it yet but for those who have played it and want to get back into it buckle up because were gonna be waiting an extraordinarily long amount of time for anything significant to release at this sluggish pace that its going

so for now im gonna continue to wait and hopefully not completely forget andor lose interest in the game by the time something new actually does come out which will probably be months at this point ill rescind my negative review when the game devs give us something worth coming back to

edit 11132022  ive been really itching to play again and ive been holding off until mistlands comes out but after a long enough hiatus a couple friends of mine wanted to boot it up again so i finally caved and started up another new save and world gotta say ive actually been having a blast and ive started to remember how i got hooked so easily to the game i knew id start to enjoy it again once firing it up ive just been hesitant because i dont wanna find myself burning out again before the update weve been waiting so extraordinarily long for finally drops and i look at mistlands like  eh ya know ill probably switch this over to a positive review in the near future because i do genuinely love the game and think people whove yet to play it should play it ive just been very upset with the sluggish pace in which the games development has been on top of the game devs silencing negative feedback and keeping pretty mute during this process

edit 01092023  mistlands was a pretty extraordinary update new biome is challenging and rewarding more available playstyles added building variety and crafting stations just simply put weve finally gotten a sizable update as you can tell from my review from a couple months ago i was pretty sour with what felt like a hiatus in the games development but now here we are with mistlands making me eat my own words on the quality of the game its one of those things where it really does just needs lots of time to curate and while the time to get refreshing new content does take longer than id like it to the content that does drop is pretty fulfilling after once again completing just about everything you can do in the game i find myself taking on ambitious building projects and mapping neat sights and biome generations while i now wait for what will probably be the ships and sea update which im pretty excited for ngl and i imagine after a few months ill grow impatient again seeing how much time i put into the game but realistically i should be grateful for the game we do have seeing as its pretty stellar for an incomplete game and just be a bit more patient great work on this update iron gate i hope we can expect another quality update and development progress for the next big one and i selfishly hope it arrives within the new year i dont wanna wait another year and a half for it lol

edit 02142024  were waiting another year and a half for it

what can i say this is a beautiful game and could be both very soothing and tense at times it is just that immersive with a good pacing and can really channel ones creativity
and  the bees are happy

#####

i would heavily recommend the game if there was any forward momentum on it the game hit 10million copies sold in april 2022 lets say they only got to keep 25 of the price it sells for so they made 50 million dollars now we are at 2 years later with no new biome and 2 scrapped roadmaps because they couldnt keep to them but they brag about buying a pony and going on vacation for a month while fans are waiting for what they bought the game for the roadmap was amazing it feels like the devs made more than they ever thought possible and now just do minor bug fixes dont believe me look at the discussion page for the game they deleted every single thread not made by them and locked down all of the comments because everyone kept asking about mistlands which should have been released a year ago even if it was a paid expansion it would have shown the devs care at all about the game hell they could pull a skyrim and start adding modders content into the core game and expand that way and just pay those modders or something any forward momentum

#####

youre wet

#####

i am not much of a survival game player generally i never got into other games of the genre and the only reason i got this game was because some of my work mates mentioned it and said it was worth it

hot damn i have never been so invested in a game this has it all my basebuilding skills are shocking so one of my mates is the architect and i am the procurement guy

need stones on it
need silver on it
need to murder things on it

i have only killed 3 bosses so far and i am loving every second of it i cannot wait for this game to reach its full potential

#####

noita hades crosscode now valheim has joined the strongest greats of the last few years for me it needs friends to make great but in my heart it earns the spot as a game that stays true and pure i hope the few future updates polish it up nicely and it makes a solid landing out of early access  good job iron gate

#####

the first time i laid eyes on a troll i saw its club firstand its treeclub took me completely by surprise i only just managed to roll out of the way of its first swing with its club  which sailed over my head and destroyed the rock i had been antleringpickaxe i had not much time to react to the monstrosity leering down at me the battle that followed was so much fun exhilarating one blow from that troll felt enough to kill me instantly but i stayed calm rolled at his nuts when he struck and carefully baiting then punishing the trolls attacks it smacked me once thankfully without the club and my fears were proven as i was left with 2 hp once it was all over i felt a rush that i can only compare to the one i felt defeating a boss in dark souls then a fucking tree man killed me with a rock from behind
thats when i knew i was going allin on valheim gifted 5 copies to various friends and i havent stopped playing since


#####

imagine calling yourself a viking and then complaining about the cold during a summer night

910 would get torn apart by angry wolves because i was mining too near to their mountain again lose 1 point because i cant pet the wolf cubs despite them being smol and cute

#####

overall if you like survival games you will enjoy valheim for 14 on sale or 20 regular price you should easily be able to get about 3040 hours of fun out of the game before you run out of things to do

valheim is like many other minecraftinspired survival games the basic concept is that you build a base fight monsters collect x number of y things and use those items to build more things valheim differs from some of its competitors in that even though it is open world it has a linear progression and each area biome is meant to be played successively bosses gate necessary items and important powers some survival games have similar mechanics eg terraria but many others eg minecraft conan exiles are much more forgiving about where the player can explore and are more open world in that sense than valheim is

we can divide survival games into categories there are 3d ones like minecraft conan exiles rust the forest and valheim then there are the odd 2d ones like terraria survival games have a wide variety of visual styles from conan exiles stunning beauty to minecrafts classic blocky look valheim has a playstation one aesthetic describing it is difficult but if you imagine a playstation one game with high draw distance and glorious weather effects and lighting then you would have valheim

the problem is that this aesthetic has severe limitations the viking theme is great and there is so much that could be done with that but the playstation one graphics quality restricts what the theme can accomplish character models are blurry so are the armours weapons    everything really you might like this aesthetic i vastly prefer the more realistic aesthetic of a game like conan exiles because i like having the ability to design a uniquelooking character wear awesome and customized armour and construct impressivelooking buildings valheim has a neat look but its hard to say that its aesthetic inspires awe

the building aspect of valheim suffers from similar limitations there are few options for customizing buildings there are only a few different visual styles the building system is frankly a mess when compared to other survival games systems minecraft is a breeze terraria is straightforward if limited in its own ways especially since its in 2d and conan exiles has a robust building system that is user friendly valheim is closest to conan exiles in how the building system works except where conan exiles has easy connecting points on building pieces valheim opts for a bizarre concept that includes connecting points but also nonconnecting points so you can in theory jam building pieces together to create something uniquelooking

this is a great idea but the execution is terrible building most things in valheim is a chore for several reasons first the sheer number of materials needed for just about anything takes forever to obtain second the building appearance options are limited third the building controls are clunky building anything beyond the most basic structure becomes an exercise in frustration in the same time that it takes you to build a basic house in valheim you could have built an impressivelooking temple or fort in conan exiles

on top of that there are valheims random events which involve monsters attacking your base these monsters can and often will destroy your base conan exiles has a similar mechanic but it is avoidable and can be turned off entirely via the menu the only way currently to turn off valheims random events involves using console commands or installing mods 

in theory defending a base from random attacks would be fun in conan exiles it often is because you can set up guards traps and all kinds of other things to defend your base in valheim youre forced to defend your base through bizarre or cheap tactics that are so ridiculous that they ruin the fantasyvikingaesthetic the rest of the game is built upon for instance you could try to defend against raids by digging deep pits all around your base spamming construction tables everywhere to try to prevent enemies from spawning and so on valheims defense system is like minecrafts old prevent enemies from spawning by putting torches everywhere thing except worse

frankly i find the raids annoying fun is not spending countless hours gathering materials and fighting against valheims clumsy building system in order to construct a base that i will have to defend either through goofy strategies or by turning off raids entirely via console commands or mods the only other option is to accept that a base left without cheatlike defenses will collapse

where valheim shines is in the cooperative playing experience playing with friends or on a wellrun public server can be a lot of fun the problem with the latter is that valheim isnt designed for more than 10 players and lags if more people are in an area compared to conan exiles 40 players per server or the immense numbers that can run about in minecraft at once this is another major limitation of valheim

the best parts of valheim are when you are discovering things for the first time going into the black forest and progressing from fleeing from trolls to killing them in their own caves entering the plains and getting chased by flying insects etc are all lots of fun but again there are limitations

for instance the randomlygenerated map is enormous and contains many different islands and continents featuring the different biomes in theory this is amazing however the problem is that once a biome has been completed there is basically no reason ever to return to that biome this is weird because it means that valheims biomes are more like levels what should be an awesome exploration experience look new land that we havent explored instead becomes a timewasting journey oh great another island with meadows on it lets sail past it this means that the enormous map is mostly unused and unimportant why have such a huge world if there is nothing special between one meadows biome and another

the above is all fine if what you are hoping to get out of this game is a 3040 hour adventure where you and a few friends start off with nothing build a base and play through the game as the progression intends but if you are hoping for more staying power eg more things to discover more things to fight more things to do more things to build valheim is lacking there is little depth here

compare this to conan exiles where you could if you want construct countless buildings of immense size scope and beauty explore a vast map with secrets hidden away fight a wide variety of monsters design and dress up your character to suit what you want to play etc consider that conan exiles has dedicated pvp servers which have their problems sure but valheim is suboptimal for pvp even though its possible in theory roleplaying servers if thats your thing and so on and you are looking at easily hundreds of hours of content in conan exiles that is much the same as valheims content offerings but all around better in just about every single regard both games have many faults but valheim is nothing special in comparison to its older and bigger competitors and that lack of special is the issue

valheim could be vastly improved and maybe it will be the best way to make this game amazing would be to take pages from terrarias book and fill biomes with randomly generated treasures that do all sorts of cool things expand the inventory slots so that carrying more things around at a time is doable make exploration matter by creating more items enemy types dungeons caves events out in the world etc create more building options improve the building system if these were done this game would be amazing now its just good enough

so much fun to share  adventures  with  my  vr  chat familyi love it and i am almost 70 years old  i am learning to face my fear and  have  such a  great  time   i am an artist and  i  love  the  art  really  a  great  job


#####

i guess i sorta like this game

#####

this game is great but very disappointing its a small team give them a break they are just overwhelmed cause they have so much success i dunno if these people really grasp the scope here

they did 100000000 in sales in the first bmonthb 

lets take steams cut averaged somewhere around 23 at volume or 23 million if you prefer

they have 77000000

then lets take the publishers cut im not sure on the exact number but the industry average is somewhere around 15 something like 115 million

they have 65450000

then lets take taxes im not a taxematician but lets just say they got reamed at 50 

they have 32720000 

then lets give igenerousi padding for various expense repayments like machinessoftwaretravelfoodutilitiesworkspace etc with a 1 million buffer

they have 31720000

finally lets give a generous margin of error and say 5 million got lost in the cracks somewhere

they have 27720000 net in the first bmonthb that is awesome i would be iveryi thrilled with those figures as a small development team in the first month of release

as an entity lets subtract a bsuper superb generous salary of 70

they have 8317500 to invest into the company in the first bmonthb

lets assume they go a little crazy after that first month and get a new office brand new computers buy everyone a top end company uteslau ufly gordon ramsay in to cook them a private dinneru  bbuy everyone 5 a giant 400oz bar of pure 24k gold like the brick zeus takes in die hard 3b

they bstillb have 38 million to reinvest in the company the average unity developer makes 100000 a year lets say they dont want to mess around and bdoubleb the average salary to 200000 to get some quality people asap

bin the first month of sales after platformpublishertaxsalarydevelopment costs  insanely irresponsible spending sprees they can afford to hire 19 full time unity developers at double the average salary for a yearb 

imagine what you could accomplish in one year if you had an idea and 19 full time game developers just waiting for instructions

that is why this game is disappointing 


#####

im a pretty casual player but for a game described as a brutal survival it ticked a lot of boxes for me while the game has a lot of trademarks of an early access game such as unfinished biomes and some balancing issues its positives are many the progression system is easy to understand and pushes you forward to keep exploring the combat wont challenge souls veterans any time soon but for a casual like me it pushed me to try harder and was challenging in a good way  certainly a step up from games like minecraft lol i also appreciate the simple numbers in the game there are no complex skill trees and cryptic combat numbers you live or die in the game based on the armour you wear the weapons you craft and the food you eat while levelling up basic weapon skills its a really simple system and it works although minmaxxers will probably be disappointed 

as mentioned exploration is a huge part of the game and you will be doing a lot of it that feeling of discovering a new biome is a very rare gaming moment of excitement the game will punish you harshly if you try to explore a new biome unprepared but thats part of the fun and learning experience the game doesnt cockblock your progression with insanely difficult bosses the bosses will be difficult for the unprepared but theyre easily beaten by players who know the combat mechanics theres also easy ways to cheese each boss if youre impatient to move on or just cant beat them the usual way the biggest challenge is finding the bosses in the first place again thats a big part of the exploration element of the game although sometimes it can be frustratingly difficult 

in terms of negatives id like to see the developers make an effort to optimize the game further as it stands its a performancehungry game and i feel like it holds me back when it comes to building im hesitant to build anything too elaborate because it comes with a performance hit i also think that the mechanic of denying portal transport of ore feels too contrived i completely understand why it exists but i think better game design elements should make it retired its not a huge issue since you can bypass that restriction without using any mods or exploits but i think its a nuisance and theres so many ways to design better means of motivating players to explore and expand

allinall i highly recommend valheim for an early access game its extremely polished and will only get better at least two major patches with new content have been released in its first year and more is on the way these developers are definitely not the type to rush new updates so impatient gamers should be aware the actual game itself will also not appeal to the impatient types but for those nonhardcore types looking to give themselves a new challenge dont be put off by the brutal survival tag  valheim has been one of the funnest and most satisfying games ive played in recent years and i cant wait to see whats ahead

troll got a nice ass

#####

as far as sandboxcraftingsurvival games go valheim stands out from the lot for several reasons

gorgeous art direction gripping atmosphere base building  terraforming thats neither too freeform nor too restricting but most importantly a straightforward sense of progression byou never feel the urge to look for something in a fan wikib this is by far the thing that drives me nuts the most with minecraft and their ilk if i have to open my browser and look for info on a wiki thats a failure on the part of the game valheim avoids this by providing clear progression goals as well as tutorials and hints from the crow npc if theres one thing every other sandboxcraftingsurvival game should be stealing from valheim it needs to be that

i played the game with a team of a few friends on a locallyhosted server and we had a blast we made it all the way to the current endgame this was over a year ago and i have very fond memories of playing

it doesnt seem like there have been enough updates since then to warrant returning though 

also i will say that i completely disabled the ingame music and i had the soundtracks of ecco the dolphin defender of the future  the ecco songs of time cd i cant explain it but seriously yeah put on treefish or aqua vistas while exploring forests in this game it works so well with the dreamlike hazy atmospheres and now i cant disassociate valheim from these soundtracks in my mind

in summary great coop time with friends make sure to always play together youll have a blast

absolutely awesome i am more of a farming sim casual player and my partner is a edgelord mechanics king and the game hits both of our interests please more decor

this game saved my life

i am 50

my exwife and i have a daughter together and adopted our son together they are now both 4 years old

when we were going through our separation i found myself lost and miserable i was self destructive i got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that i punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion that caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand my working hand my games hand the hand that i held and carried my children to bed with the hand i desperately needed to make sure i could continue to provide

after learning of the severity of my selfinflicted damage i was borderline suicidal keep in mind that just a few months before this i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety i have never had fits of rage or been one to break down and cry but i was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side

having nothing better to do i searched for a game i could play one handed while i recovered i somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews i decided that it had to be worth a shot i must admit i didnt beat the game or play nearly as long as some of you in fact i may have only played this game a day or two with that being said after doing so i had a new found joy and hope for life i was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me i was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness i was able to see the fruits of my labor i relaxed for 5 hillary hillary hillary hillary hillary hillary hillary minutes to this music long enough to realize that i was going to be okay
after coming to that realization i turned the game off and i went back to work it hurt my hand like hell but i was motivated i stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself and i became the father i needed to be in that moment not the weak boy i was behaving as

today i am close friend with my kids mother we dont fight or argue or say hurtful things to each other we are parents and friends

i now have 3 kids my third child is wait for it also 4 years old the woman i am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly we have been in a relationship for a year now and are very happy together

moral of the story you never know what life holds in store for you and if i would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me i wouldnt be where i am today this silly little game helped me realize that

thank you

#####

on this spot a tree fell on my head and i cursed the gods so i leave this stone in praise of them that they might forgive my reckless words

#####

i cant stop playing this damn game im over 200 hours and im not even past the swamp biome yet because i wanted to make my own decently sized uniquely crafted home town i feel like i have my own little realm to escape to and i can invite friends who play into my server for us to do things together as well and make them their own little place inside of my world throughout all of the frustration trolls destroying my structures ive spent hours on in one hit has almost made me rage quit multiple times i still open the game every day and work on some things i feel as though im cultivating my own gameplay experience my own little rpg realm things fall together and look natural and beautiful so well the game seems to have the right amount of things to do and the right amount of things to come i guess the main thing i would like to say about this game is this its challenging but relaxing at the same time 3

#####

everything i always wanted in a game these devs did a great job didnt overcharge and continue to update it  my alltime favorite game and that says a lot

#####

rock and stone

#####

the game had potential but after a massive surge of popularity during the covid lockdowns resulting in millions of copies being sold as a fotm game for casuals the developers made millions and it clearly destroyed any interest they had in actually finishing the game after 2 years of being early access there was only one minor update that added a few items and clothing options when the developers had promised 3 new biomes back when they first released the game 

well here we are 2 years later and there isnt a single new biome added at the current rate it would take them 6 years to finish this game but clearly they have no interest in doing so since they already made more money than they ever could have hoped to during the initial rush the player base has dwindled to a handful of people out of initially millions and theres no content on the horizon that will justify paying the price theyre still charging for this not even half finished never to be finished early access game

buyer beware unless you have a group of friends to play with and are wholly aware you are going to be purchasing an abandoned game you should avoid this one

#####

unpopular opinion i dont love valheim anymore

when i started it became one of my favorite games of all time it was perfect mechanically and interesting artistically i loved all the systems in the game building is simple but not simplistic i dont have to be an architect to enjoy building a castle in the mountains but my castle is unique from everyone elses the food system is brilliant instead of debuffs every few minutes which make you open the ui and click on a mushroom just so you can play the game normally you get rewarded for harvesting farming hunting and cooking the biomes while relatively monotonous are unique enough that i have to approach each one differently and be prepared beforehand i know i need to take blunt weapons to the swamp and some poison resistance ill need some frost resistance for the mountains until i can craft a cape and i need to learn to parry with a shield if im ever going to survive the plains 
i could go on about all the creative ways that the game rewards you for playing instead of punishing you how its challenging but not unfair but unfortunately all of that is overshadowed by a few really basic gamebreaking problems and no its not that the devs arent working fast enough for me id prefer a quality game eventually over a buggy game now and i certainly am in no place to judge whether or not they are working hard enough
no its their decisions and the direction that the game is consistently going that make me wish i hadnt dropped 400 hours into building the perfect base and beating every boss

right around the swamp area the game grinds to a halt all of a sudden the game switches genres from openworld exploration building and combat to a chore simulator please dont misunderstand me i dont hate challenging games and i firmly believe that there is a place for frustration and tedium in video games but i dont play games so that i will feel bored and honestly mining in valheim is so boring and after the midpoint in the game so far mining is all youll ever be doing want to survive in the next biome youll need 200 iron for weapons and armor and crafting equipment want to build a base youll need several hundred more unless you want to use iron supports to build a big base then youll need another 100 or so of course youll need reinforced chests and cooler lights and iron gates so youd better get another few hundred just in case not to mention youll need 1020 iron for armor and weapons in each new biome as well the problem with that is that each iron scrap weighs 10lbs and you can only carry 450lbs of course youll be carrying about 100lbs of equipment just to survive in the swamp so make that 350lbs and each crypt holds an average of 60 iron scraps what that translates into is the next major problem travel time
the world is too damn big its huge its gigantic but it doesnt need to be there are only 6 biomes active there will be 9 in total and it takes literally hours to travel once youve exhausted the resources on your first 2 or 3 islands youll have to sail approximately 3040 minutes to the next location not including the hours it will take to discover it in the first place the sailing mechanics are pretty cool actually and i enjoy them a lot but most of it is just sitting and waiting 
this is partially solved by portals which are a cool idea but not really because you cant portal certain arbitrary items i know there is a big argument about portals and i understand both sides i like the idea of having items that cant be teleported because it forces me to get off the beaten path and explore new areas except you dont actually explore when youre transporting ores back to your base you dont have any adventures you just sit in a boat and pray for good winds because you forgot to teleport back to the altar for the favorable wind power or you didnt bother because it only lasts a few minutes anyway 
the devs have said on multiple occasions in interviews that they dont want to make an easy game i completely agree with that there is no reason for valheim to pander to a casual audience or to be beaten by every player who plays it but being long and being hard dont say anything are two very different things one of them also mentioned that hard does not mean more hp unfortunately i think thats exactly whats happened with yagluth and now with the mistlands yagluth only has three attacks like all the bosses and two of them will oneshot you no matter what and he has so much health relative to the other bosses its crazy
in other words im bored with the game and i have been for a long time i just didnt notice great for the devs i guess they got a lot more playtime out of me than i wish id given i dont recommend picking this game up itll suck your time away and leave you feeling frustrated im not exactly sure what could fix it but some ideas that should be discussed are decreasing map size decreasing crafting costs increasing content for existing biomes and improving teleportation somehow

some minor gripes that are unbelievably frustrating
i cant hit enemies who are slightly higher or lower than i am but they can hit me really they added an entirely new biome mostly made of rocks and inclines and they cant fix this stupid mechanic 
walls seem like they are made of paper whether its wood iron or stone so the only viable way of defending my base is by either digging a moat or raising the earth so the ai cant path into my base there is literally only one strategy to base defense and it consists entirely of making the ai completely irrelevant 
greydwarves spawn everywhere all the time they are not a challenge they are annoying they just punish me for doing things rather than rewarding me for getting stronger
there is a lot of interaction with somewhat ugly ui making marks on the map equipping stuff eating stuff etc crafting is unnecessarily tedious 
crafting anything in or around the water is stupid how am i supposed to make a bridge a dock or even place a boat anywhere
many build pieces are for aesthetic purposes only and yet are extremely expensive not only do more advanced pieces cost more but their materials are more complicated to use and weigh more i mean it makes sense that building a stone wall takes more work than building a wood wall but anything tougher than a greydwarf can just bust it down and youll have plenty of raids to prove it 
the ai is bad i dont understand why every mob in the game has the exact same pattern of hitting you once running around in a big circle then hitting you once then running etc what is that ive never seen anything like that in any other game
subjective opinion i dont like how hard progression is locked behind a linear structure id love it if as a veteran player i could sneak a bit of silver from the mountains in the early game because i know the mechanics so well but thats impossible because even if you could find a silver vein without the wishbone you couldnt mine it without an iron pickaxe which you cant make unless you have the swamp key which you cant get unless youve defeated the first two bosses i like more open progression systems better but i understand if they dont agree with me on this one

tldr
valheim began as a onceinalifetime idea with masterful implementation but has quickly devolved into padding the runtime to keep players playing longer without actually making it interesting fun or challenging im sorry to say that ive had a really fun time with certain parts of the game but looking back i can see that most of my time was spent just trying to recapture the magic i felt during the first 20 hours unfortunately i didnt succeed

after the grey dwarfs  the fatbellied skinnyarmed with yellow or blue or red glowing eyes  after they destroyed my raft on the far edge of the black forest i understood it was time to rest strip my armor and attempt sneaking back to my main base camp through unknown territory  i had avoided the perils of the land by taking a raft back and forth several times to build a new camp  but now without the raft there was no other way than to find out what i had been avoiding

good thing ive been practicing sneaking as it helps to tell when theyve seen you  the first one to see me naked and barefoot through the thick of the forest was a skeleton archer  he got off a shot and dropped my health somewhat but after playing ring around the rosy running in circles around a giant boulder i finally turned around to face him head on and took him out rather easily with my club

next were 2 campsites about 100 meters apart occupied by more groups of dwarves  im not sure why they are called dwarves  they look like fat aliens  going between their camps would be easy enough except for a giant troll who hadnt seen me  trolls scare me  maybe because they can take down trees in a single swing when it takes me about 12 swings  so im guessing around 150 damage if he hits me and id have to start my naked run all over again

but the troll saw something that caught his attention and i was able to sneak to where he had been standing undetected and by then i could see my border between black forest and meadows camp  which i wasnt about to risk going into and having the troll flatten the whole place  i just kept running in familiar territory  the worst was now behind me

after building a new raft at my main camp i loaded up more supplies and wood that cant be found in black forest and sailed back again  the dwarves that had destroyed my earlier raft i had killed and apparently no new ones had spawned  i took all the supplies into the new camp storage and decided it was time to try a dungeon the crow had told me had treasure

the dungeon is a grave of some sort and taking out skeletons this time in armor was not difficult  interesting new loot in the graves here too  but this luck ran out fairly quickly when i discovered these halls did not only have skeletons and graves but also ghosts and in a blur of activity me swinging madly in the dark the ghost got the best of me and my grave was among the others in that dungeon  time to naked run again

this time it was very straightforward  i had luckily not gotten very far into the dungeon before dying so recovering my grave marker wasnt difficult  probably not a good day to play with ghosts i think  ill try that out when ive improved my armor weapons and food to have better chances next time

i still have not encountered any bosses  like theres a deer boss  which i dont even know where to find him to fight him  but i have managed to set up systems that allow me to shoot very dangerous enemies from safety  just the way i like it  ive even killed a couple nuisance trolls from the safety of a raft

what i like the most about this game is that even after dying and having a huge temptation to rush as fast as possible to get back my items from my grave marker it only takes a few minutes of hunting and trying to rebuild and prepare for going back to where i died and i get lost in enjoying the game  i spend countless hours dorking around rolling logs around to break the trees i dont have the real tools to chop down  but there are ways to get around this and its just silly fun

i also really like the base building  without it this game would be just another rpgcrafting gameplay but the basebuilding  and the trolls who will blast the whole thing to the ground  keep me coming back for more

compared to other rpgs this has minimal clutter  theres no quest diary list that goes on forever and nobody cares  theres no list at all yet there is always something to do  some tension of knowing there is little chance of getting over the next threshold to access new materials and building options

this game has multiplayer coop but i havent tried that  playing it as singleplayer is fine though maybe a little dry

people have complained that the graphics are not up to their standards  and i can almost see this to a point  i really hardly notice it as when im focused on trying to accomplish something the screenshot quality is not the experience  also the lighting is just mindblowing at least for me  these grand moments of enjoying the view happen just often enough they are worth mentioning  as i appreciate them every time it happens

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2438257086

the game also doesnt have steam achievements  a it doesnt have what  i agree  that is the correct answer at least for most people who care more about gameplay  which is what i buy games for

the 2 things i really care about

 is this game fun  absolutely  it is a complete blast

 is this game worth full price or should i wait for a sale  to answer this take a look at whatever you are playing now  does it keep you wanting to play for hours on end  if not this might be worth the full price for you  why wait

update
this game is in early access which means the gameplay mechanisms can change and break some flow  ie stuff i was able to cook in an earlier gamesave i cant cook anymore  sort of a wtf moment  as i just want to continue with the original game goals but the game sort of gets in its own way when the mechanisms change  hopefully that will completely stop by the time the game is released but you never know  the developers did go out of their way to prevent players from making ingenious lootfarms  which i thought was a little overzealous on the devs part when they could be working on other stuff but in their defense they went out of their way to prevent players from breaking the game for themselves which hey if you want to break the game that should be your business and not the devs

#####

diamond in the rough a multi million early access best seller that the devs bounced off they hit 6 million sales then threw the development roadmap out and have been very slowly dropping content thats been underwhelming at best still a very much enjoyable game but i bought it with developer commitments that no longer stand the long playtime represents a long grind for resources that i honestly rather not do again i recommend it if you like survival games but dont put your money on the developers words its best to move forward without expectations in that regard



iwe slowed down development because a lot of people bought our game so were canceling our roadmap also we bought a horsei  b iron gate may 2021 1 month after early access release b

iwere pushing a rebalance of core mechanics and ai behavior then tomorrow well go on vacationsi b iron gate december 2021 b

ithe update is functioning as intendedi  b iron gate 3 days later b

iweve taken the time and commitment to address player feedback since the last update so were going to become martyrs and sacrifice our vacations in order to tackle these issuesi b iron gate 1 week later b

iwhen valheim was released into ea over a year ago we had to cancel our roadmap on that roadmap we had an update called cult of the wolf planned as the second update for 2021 were no longer calling it that and these caves are essentially that updatei  b iron gate march 2022 this one is a real quote b

iwere applying a small 86kb patch to address some issues that will break mods more complex and elaborate than anything weve added in the past 8 monthsi  b iron gate every week from june 2022 to november 2022  b

iwere launching the mistlands update expanding further over issues already present that were failing to address such as horrible enemy hitboxes and metals balancei b iron gate december 2022b

i like cutting the trees

#####

i cant get enough of the cozy atmosphere of this game i love it so much great to play with friends great alone this game is a musttry i cant wait to see how the future updates pan out

#####

wonderful survival rpg game with a great linux version

#####

its one of those games that you wish you could play for the first time again

#####

being a norwegiandane anything to do with norse mythology and the vikings will most likely immediately grab my attention i know i am late to the party and the hype has died down a bit but i just wanted to say that since getting valheim yesterday i have been playing for 14 hours straight the game had me hooked and addicted the very second i jumped into the world of valheim  also known as the tenth world  and i have not been able to stop playing since the first thing you notice upon your arrival is the unique but very charming art style they decided to use personally i love it although i do understand why some people may not you either love it or you hate it and that is fine for me though this art style really brings a lot of charm and character to the game games like runescape and minecraft are also perfect examples of games that visually just looks different  and it works it works so well i can not stress enough how much warmth the graphics and art style in valheim brings 

for me personally valheim is a generational game  like the aforementioned minecraft and runescape  where it will still thrive and have a massive community for generations to come i can see myself playing this game for many more years or so i hope at least anyways if you are a fan of being able to build things this game is also for you i absolutely love the building aspect of this game whilst there are not that many options in build menu you are still able to craft some beautiful houses and even entire villages again just like minecraft valheim does this so well the combat system is great as well and although i have not defeated all the bosses just yet i love everything from the preparation to a boss fight to the actual fight itself the combat system is oddly satisfying in valheim 

in terms of performance i have an i79700k 16gb of ram and rtx 2070 super the game runs buttery smooth for me 99 of the time with the occasional stutter on maxed out graphics  although that is to be expected right  and so far i have not run into any bugs glitches or crashes so in that regard i am extremely pleased early access game can be very either or here so far i have nothing negative to say about the game although i would love to see the implementation of achievements at some point i know it is not a massive priority but for a lot of us hunting and working for achievements enhances the game and incentivise us to keep playing 

tldr if you like survival type games buy valheim great graphics amazing art style fantastic visuals all around good audio fun and enjoyable combat and building system fun boss fights genuinely a steal for 1510  or whatever it costs in your region  and a game you must have in your library at this point

#####

my favorite part is building houses it is so relaxing and the music is playing  all of the sudden the little man attacks me he threw a stone what the heck what did you do that for im in your forest sorry i go now than your in an even bigger forest the little man is gone the big one throws boulders at you t_t

h2general thoughtsh2
 for an early access title valheim offers a welcoming survival experience minimizing the tedium that often accompanies the genre and generally allowing the player to take it at their own pace the game is especially wellsuited for multiplayer and i strongly recommend that you play it with friends

h3gameplayh3
the games core mechancis will be familiar to anyone whos ever played a survival game with hunting and resource gathering building and exploration all of which are surprisingly polished for an early access game the game eschews the more obnoxious survival elements like starvation or repair costs so you dont have to constantly stress over them you can focus on building your house awhile without needing to stop to eat or sleep as those elements are optional ways to boost your character there is a running questline to defeat ancient beings which provides an incentive to improve your character and explore helping to drive the game experience forward multiplayer is easy to set up and there are good reasons to play with friendsnot least of which is the fact that you can pummel your friends with impunity to level up your weapon skills

h3visualsh3
while the lighting is a strong standout the lowpoly models and lowres textures will be hit or miss personally im not typically a fan of the 90s retro look and would have preferred a different lowfi approach but the look doesnt detract from the experience for me and many will appreciate the aesthetic if you can play the game using vulkan as in its current state of development it doesnt seem particularly optimized and even strong systems will struggle to maintain decent frame rates vulkan generally performs better in this regard

h3audioh3
the games soundtrack is pleasant and appropriate for the genre while i wouldnt say it has a particularly distinctive soundtrack it doesnt get old or repetetive and adds a nice bit of ambience to a genre that typically is a little too quiet and empty sound is used well in hunting to help you locate targets and the sound effects are high quality and dont get obnoxious

h3storyh3
the story is minimalist setting you up on your quest and then letting you play periodically youll dream things but your dreams dont seem to have any effect on the game for the most part this is a mariograde plot heres your objectives now go do them barebones but the lack of a deep story doesnt detract from the game experience

h3additional thoughtsh3
earlyaccess games are usually a tossup paying money for a game that may never see completion with valheim youre getting a game thats already surprisingly polished and worth the money and theres more on the way thats rare and a good show from the developers

#####

about 60 hours into my second main play through great game and surprisingly beautiful if youre a fan of the survival genre then this game is likely right up your alley i think this is the best implementation of gamified survival mechanics that i have ever seen 

often in survival games you just eat whatever is at hand to prevent the dot of starving or thirst its a boring repetitious mechanic that usually is problematic in the beginning and then is just an annoyance as you progress valheim uses food and drink to determine the players basic health and stamina stats this is inspired not only does this remove the monotony of having to eat to stay alive it makes food a progression mechanic having to discover the biomes and progress through them by exploration and technology is also a journey that i am fully enjoying

910 would play again

#####

one of the best games ive bought on steam

playing this game for the first time gave me the feeling of starting minecraft all over again without knowing anything about it this is what i recommend for new players do not look anything up it makes the game 10 times more enjoyable 

took a break after beating the game for a few weeks and started a new world and character last week and im fully enjoying it again

#####

edit updates so far are good game basically feels done now but still missing new ships and two biomes in the world that are placeholders all that said game will easily provide 100200 hours of engagement lightning in a bottle gameplay hope it keeps getting refined over time

good game bad pr devs got lazy after making their millions and a year and a half later we have 25 of the content they assured us would come by the end of last year if they advertised as a completed game no problem 1010 but when you go early access you are being payed to finish the game the amount of content that was developed in a year and a half is downright laughable and disappointing

#####

update still no updates of note still the same developer who give scraps for information or no information about content while marketing overprices plushies instead privately the developers like to flaunt what they did for the millions they earned however the development of this game continues to be a joke in terms of speed information and community involvement moderators still handing out arbitrary bans to people who give constructive criticism but not to the often rude gatekeeping fans of the studio 

in short valheim is still an unfinished ea product iron gate studios still maintains its bad developer conduct original review to be seen below

originally i was going to be entirely positive to this game but that view has changed a bit recently 

its worth noting that this game is fantastic in many ways it has adventure it has survivalism and you can larp a viking in the old norse afterlife so far all good the graphics are what id call ugly but pretty its quite satisfying actually the game though unfinished has many good qualities that id recommend

but you do need to know that you get a half finished game and the prognosis on getting the rest of it is quite gloomy as it looks right now after the games initial success and massive wealth they made from it the developers simply decided to reduce their development speed to that of a snail with no major updates given over 18 months time merely some esthetics and the occasional enemy here and there criticism over this fact does not uncommonly result in arbitrary bans from the moderators on the community boards 

in short the developers took the money from the games initial success and made it into their paid hobby project the roadmaps linked to the project by release were tossed out the window and information on future updates is minimal and sporadic 

you may well get your moneys worth odds are you might but youd also be supporting some very bad developer conduct and while you may enjoy the journey while it lasts the odds youll see the end of it and game completion with it is low at least in this century 

if you enjoy grinding your way to the halfway mark of the game a few times farm carrots and beets and build new esthetic houses infinately this is your game its quite fun if youre looking to adventure to foreign lands and meet new challenging creatures to slay with your friends then this is only partially your game  you are not the prime audience please take that into account

#####

i want to make this review before the next big update comes out so hopefully it can change what i dislike about this game so far and keep in mind that i dont mean any harm but id like to talk about it if needed

valheim is a beautiful game there really isnt much like it in terms of graphic design and ideology
its an interesting survival game based on norse mythology and you feel that orginality much more when you when youre actually in it the buildings themes and enemies fit the world perfectly and help you feel like a viking of the 10th world

but i feel like this game needs to be more developed there isnt too many bugs or glitches and my experience was flawless in that regard i am actually talking about the progression and possible buildsbranches you could have on your adventure and this will most likely target players that already have played the game a bit and will contain spoilers for the first four bosses this is highly opinionated


bosses in valheim do not drop enough loot most of the time their power and an item to further the progression there is not rare drops or consumables you could get for killing the boss again
i think it would be interesting to have the first try on the boss drop their power and the key item but then further tries will make the boss harder but give you more interesting loot that is purely optional doing the boss multiple times would become an optional rewarding challenge

this section will talk about boss powers and contains spoilers
spoiler the bosses drop active powers that have a 5minutes effect time and a 20minutes cooldown my biggest issue with this is that sometimes they are a bit underwhelming and not passive enough a good example is the second power that allows you to cut wood faster it would be in my opinion better to have it help you harvest other resources too like mining and maybe foraging with passive effects when you arent using the buff like small boosts that are unique to the power you have equiped because you have to go back to spawn to switch out powers you are somewhat sacrificing the first power to run for a long distance and jump easier for resource harvesting there is no point in keeping them when you could have another unless you need them a passive effect would also help the power to not feel as useless when its on cooldown 
also who ever chose to make the power of wind behind your back so late in the game why did you not think of that being a reward for a boss before people need to start sailing sometimes really far away it really feels like an optional reward more than a full powerspoiler

skills themselves are a bit of a minor quality of life you get a increase in damage and sometimes stamina reduction
when you die you might loose a lot of levels depending on how high it is
personally i feel like there should be milestones granting you new unlockable abilities or effects per skill
for example at 1535 and 50 you could unlock different skills that you can choose to equip one of for some weapons like the two handed clubs ex stagbreaker you could unlock 15 a charge jump attack that has long windup and huge stamina cost for more damage more resource damage on small trees bushes and could pick resources out of the ground like rocks and crops or maybe a way to do more aoe damage but in a more directional angle in front of you instead of all around you now you could pick from one of these at a time making you and your weapons stronger and more strategic
also you wouldnt be able to loose levels under like every 10 level so it would feel like you arent at a great loss if you finally reach a round number like 30 or 40
you could also have unlocks for skills like running or swimming maybe a stealth boost and some sort of fast swimming i think its fun to let you mind drift away and imagine those upgrades little rewards that feels more physical than  increases i still think its good to keep the  increases dont get me wrong

please make a way to teleport metal i dont mind having to smelt it first and make an outpost for it maybe make some different teleporter that requires more area for it but hauling all that metal isnt much fun after the first time so i think having to upgrade both teleporters with iron bars would make it interesting

side suggestion it would be nice to have more sea serpents that have different levels depending on deeper in the sea you go giving better scales maybe an armor that you make with base scales and need the harder scales to upgrade each tier being much stronger maybe bonuses too but having a tougher fight 
maybe by going deep enough in the sea we could find a boss arena for jörmungandr some broken islands and shipwrecks making some large platform it could be a colossal boss that pushes you around and gives very interesting loot i could see this as an update of itself sorry if it seems a bit silly


i really want this game to keep going and improve it genuinly could become an adventure as large as minecraft with even more fantasy and mythology and i want my friends to have a great experience with me

thank you iron gate studio for working on valheim thank you for offering a game that genuinly changes the market if i could work on a game as a designer i would want to work a on a game like this




mistlands update edit im replaying through the game and oh my god do not make a base in the black forest enemies wont fricking leave me alone i have like 20 workbenches but they keep on spawning i cant progress through the grind if i keep gettng assaulted

#####

the game is very fun until you kill the second boss and go to the swamp then you just get bummed

collapsing trees onto your friends has never been so fun

short review
a beautifully crafted adventure game infused with norse mythology and viking aesthetics if you enjoy survivalsandbox games like minecraft then youll enjoy this game the world is your oyster to explore plenty of land enemies combat resources and crafting the graphics are stunning and the atmosphere is breathtaking thanks to the unity engine be sure to have the latest hardware to play this game because your pc may run slow so where to build your home the meadow is the easiest and safest to build however consider upgrading your home from time to time because your home will get attacked with stronger enemies as you progress this game requires a tremendous amount of patience as your defense and stamina is significantly low you should also take note that the build system is not beginner friendly your workbench needs a roof and you must build a fireplace near your bed in order to rest

full review
valheim has several biomes with their own unique enemies meadow black forest swamp ocean mountains and plains the meadow has the lowest tier enemies like the greylings and greydwarves wood creatures with melee and projectile attacks these enemies can be deadly in numbers so try to evade them early on as much as possible the meadow contains the most resource for food such as deer neck raspberries and mushrooms be sure to chop down the trees for some wood and fine wood to craft your base theres also plenty of stone and flint to build your weapons the next biome is the black forest the place for respawners of greylings and skeletons oh yeah and dont forget the giant trolls apparently theres a gang war between the greylingstrolls and skeletons so if you get chased by either one of them just run towards them youll find loot in stone forts burial caves and troll caves in this area too for resources pine trees can be cut down into core wood to build a stronger base this area has tin deposits near the shore and copper deposits near the boulders now lets talk about the swamp this place is dense with fog mud and enemies the swamp is full of draughr blob oozer leech wraith and abomination some swamps have a rare section fire geyser that are surrounded with surtling the main dungeon in this area are sunken caves and theyre loaded with draughr and iron deposits when it comes to resources this place includes ancient bark guck and turnip seeds 

moving on to the next biome is the ocean here is the home of docile fish a massive rock filled with barnacles called leviathan and a relentless monster known as the serpent chitin can be collected from leviathan and dragon scales from the serpent i recommend sailing with a karve because rafts wont stand a chance against the serpent the mountains is a brutal biome a mix of volatile enemies and the chaos of winter storms this area comes with wolves fenrir stone golems and drakes be sure to collect some wolf fur to protect yourself from the freezing effect of the climate obsidian is located near the cliffs and silver is easier to find with a wishbone the last biome is the plains and by far the most hostile area youll come across a squad of fulings deathsquitos lox and growths this area has cloudberries black metal flaxes lox furmeat tar and barley you should have high tier armor and weapons before considering to explore the plains 

so whats all this yap about the bosses in the world of valheim currently there are only five bosses and each behemoth unlocks rewards to the player in order to challenge these creatures you must gather offerings and locate their sanctuary thankfully these sanctuaries are easy to find with the help of a stone locator this is the list of bosses that can be found eikthyr the elder bonemass moder and yagluth eikthyr a massive deer infused with electricity is the first boss and by far the easiest that is located in the meadow once you defeat eikthyr youll gain an antler pickaxe and the forsaken power that gives you the ability to use stamina without a stamina cost the next boss is the elder a wood creature with projectile attacks of spiked roots that can be found in the deep forest when you have the upperhand on the elder youll be rewarded with a swamp key and an additional forsaken power that allows you to chop trees faster bonemass is the third boss from the swamp a gigantic green slimeball that inflicts poison and that releases blobs at you its worth fighting against this boss because youll have access to the wishbone and the third forsaken power your defense will be boosted the fourth boss moder is an airborne dragon that can be found at the mountain biome youll need arrow and a frost resistant armor for this fight once you win youll receive 10 dragon tears and the fourth forsaken power which grants tailwind when you sail in your karve finally the last entry on our list is called yagluth the reanimated skeleton of the dead from the plains this is no walk on the park yagluth has a devastating attack by summoning meteors and can maliciously attack from the sky yagluth drops the last forsaken power which reduces elemental damage now that you spent all this time reading try out valheim thank you for reading

man im incredibly mixed about valheim there are a lot of good ideas covered by an ungodly amount of grind and an unbalanced progression system and on top of that the game has 349k positive reviews i just dont see where is this masterpiece all of the other people cream about so to balance things out im going to bitch about the tedious stuff
 
building designing bases and buildings is my favorite aspect of survival games and valheim delivers on that front stability feature is amazing compared to other games in those genera you cant just build a bridge without support or make floating buildings it adds a touch of realism and forces you to approach building differently

biome progression if you want to progress and unlock other materials and weapons you need to slay the biome boss on one hand it is an amazing idea instead of just sitting in one place it forces you to move and create different camps you cant teleport with ores but the difficulty progression is shit meadows are not challenging in black forest the only challenging enemy is a trollstill a cake walk after that swamp just shits all over youshallow water lowering movement speed miyazakis favorite poison enemies constant enemy spawns especially at night plains mosquitos and so on you can upgrade your equipment to max and steamroll enemies in one biome but after arriving on the new one upgraded equipment falls off almost immediately

stamina system this is my biggest gripe with valheim and why im doing my negative review to increase it temporarily you need to cook different foods meat increases hpvegetables and fruits increase stamina for example deer stews duration is 25 min sounds good right naaah only for a few first minutes after that the buff is going to decrease stamina regen is another issue its too slow yeah you can create meads to increase it for a time but its another layer of grind too many actions require stamina like placing blocks destroying them repairing them and sneaking to name a few

grind everything takes too much time farm x add it to a smelter gather wood add it to a charcoal kiln wait for coal then add it to a smelter and so on its so fucking tedious there is too much babysitting especially for a solo player i played mostly with one other person

boat travelbosses sailing is fun for maybe 2 trips then it becomes a slog boss fights are kind of meh and can take too much time to complete the main problem comes from enemies that spawn randomly and decide to harass you in the middle of the fight there should be a spawn limit after you initiate the boss fight to make things more fair 

i could probably write an entire essay about stuff that irritates me but im tired and nobody reads my reviews anyway
255  not enough time wasters

i will eat a spoon full of mayonnaise for every like this gets

i am a 55 year old biker and trucker father and probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is 15 now my son got this game for from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he let me borrow his controller me and my son then played in turns and i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that

#####

valheim is almost everything you could hope from a open world survival

 skill system the more you perform an action the better you become at it unlike other games where you gain skill points by killing ennemies and use said points to levelup anything you want in valheim you must work with a bow to level up in bow skills

 progression advancing through higher difficulty zones will unlock better items at the cost of higher life threats 

 crafting crafting recipes are unlocked as you discover the ingredients to craft items while this can be used to skip the progression by asking a friend to drop by and give you ingredients to unlock recipes it is an elegant way to allow progression based purely on your ability to find said items

 transfer unlike other games in valheim your character isnt bound to a map or server you can play on a server with a friend and when that friend isnt online and his server is down you can play in solo with the same character and inventory this is particularly useful as it allows you to have a storage world where you can go safely store your valuables to be used in any game you desire this system can also be used to skip progression on your 2nd character simply log into your storage world and grab all items required to unlock all recipes

 combat combat system is quite interesting with the ability to block and to roll out of the way there are many ways to survive the attacks of your foes blocking will only negate part of the damage the better your shield the higher the damage negated dodging is the only way to completely avoid damage but it is also very difficult to perform when against multiple enemies

 food system food is the core of all your stats the better you eat the higher your stamina and health running out of food will not kill you but it will make you too weak to survive combat with low hp and almost no stamina every single action you perform will become a heavy task

 sailing valheim has the most realistic sailing ive found in any game so far the wind changing directions forcing you to either turn around of close your sails an paddle the waves rocking your boat and changing your course sideways winds almost flipping your boat as it hits your sails sailing in a storm is simply magnificent

 graphics except for your character which could have used more love from the art designers the graphics are truly beautiful the environment feels real and immersive

overall i would recommend this game to both singleplayers and multiplayers i personally think the experience is much better with a friend as it opens better combat strategy and shorten the amount of farming required dividing the tasks or simply performing them togheter singleplayer would be as enjoyable but would prove to be a much more difficult one since everything you do has to be done under the threat of being attacked

best early access game ever

the world of valheim is a huge like really really huge viking themed survival game so there is plenty to do
you will encounter many different creatures during your grand adventure discovering the many different plains each with their own flora and fauna

plus this game offers you to build your own little base in the form of a hut house a huge farm a palace or whatever you can think of which is a big plus in my book

if i have to think of one negative thing about this game is that it is best played with friends since single player can feel a little bit loney at times
but then again this game is still far from finished so who knows they might add some more npcs in the game to interact with

though im not much of a survival game player i must say that valheim has earned a little place in my heart
so i highly recommend this game

#####

odin is satisfied

just scratched the surface of this game atm but already seems a really well polished game for an early access release runs good looks good plays good combat looks simple but yet it works really well gives nice audiovisual feedback environmental effects and sounds are just amazing lots to explore and discover

linux client seems top notch also 2560x1440 maxed motion blur and chromatic abberation off it runs 70130 fps mostly around 80100 ryzen 3700x gtx 1080ti

#####

im not going to lie valheim surprised the hell out of me however having now experienced what it has to offer from its chill vibe to its focus on cooperation to its ability to chew up time like its going out of fashion its no surprise that it has been as successful as it is if you have a pc that can run it and thankfully the requirements arent outrageous you owe it to yourself to give it a shot game of the year so far for me

#####

as difficult as it is for me to do i will give this game a thumbs up i am doing this solely for my personal enjoyment of the game its definitely a game that is more fun to play with other people so that helps to push this to a positive vote 

what i am annoyed about however is  the devs lack of commitment and broken promises and next to no updates except a few very minimal ones upon launch this game sold many millions and being a small development team they could have invested some of that money into helping to progress the game but instead they scraped their roadmap twice and their updates were so minimal and so rare lucky one every 6 months to add a few things here and there this game is far from being completed the devs wasted no time in treating the community to teasers of a horse they bought instead of making their game their main focus then they tell us they are going on vacation and then months later of silence they finally update us to let us know that they are going on a vacation again 

i feel that they lack any interest in having this game completed and to top it off they had the cheek to ask the community to vote them for labor of love award that is supposed to go toward a game that has been fully released which valheim is still in early access but not just that to be eligible for this award a game would need to continue to bring out updates long after its official release so for some reason the devs are asking for votes on such an undeserving award and keep in mind this is also due to the fact that they silence their community they disable all comments because they are snowflakes that cannot accept some constructive criticism my intention here is not to bash the devs i am just being brutally honest yes this game can be stacks of fun  and they had literally the best fortune any game developer would kill to have  massive sales bringing them many millions but they blew their golden opportunity out of lack of interest in this game at this rate the game may come off early access in about 10 years if were lucky

but from that set aside the game is fun  and it has so much potential to be a very good game it just needs some more love and attention and i am sincerely hoping that the devs get their mojo back as soon as possible before this game dies i want this game to succeed i really do so i would highly recommend that if youre keen to buy wait until there is a discount i have nothing against this game except that the devs sure as hell can do a lot better actually using those many millions to invest back into their game hire a few more developers if they are struggling with a small team they have more than enough funds for petes sake

im going to be brutally honest and you can just downvote me if you want but this is coming from a player who completely beat valheim solo in 60 hours his first time playing 
i think that mistlands has completely ruined the game and its scaling of mob difficulty everything hits you for stupid ass high damage number for no reason and the combat system is not intricate enough to support this when im getting stun locked and can literally input no commands such as blocking or swinging my weapon just because 4 things agro onto me at once it becomes no longer fun to play for me at least i will not be relaunching this game until some serious scaling changes occur
dont get me wrong the first time i ever played this game i had an unmatched love for its lore and building system but the combat system is actually terrible and needs a serious overhaul me farming 100 hours of materials just to enter mistlands is not fun its just an arduous meaningless grind 
sincerely and angry gamer with nothing to play

#####

im lowkey obsessed with this game

like im not an obsessive gamer  ill play a few hours then im good to go  with valheim though lordy i sit down to play for an hour and if im not drinking enough water to make me take bathroom breaks i will spend half a day playing and not even realize it  i like that the combat is fastpaced and can be maddening makes victory all the sweeter when you do finally down the bastard but then there are nice stretches where youre just beating up the smallfry and doing things like gathering berries or planting turnips  each biome exception meadows where you start is super challenging and deadly when you first go into it the noise i made the first time i found a troll was ungodly truth but once youve equipped yourself properly you can go back to kick ass and take names  its so gratifying

its also stinking pretty  like ill settle in and watch the waves during a rainstorm  just sit there and soak it all in  ive never played a game where that was the case before

this is the kind of game anyone can play and everyone should play  1010 would recommend and for the record ive only signed out for the night because i cannot keep my eyes open much longer  this game is amazing

h1valheim or best gothic and minecraft mix ive ever seenh1

there would seem to be nothing special in this game graphics straight from the ps1 era a nonoily plot that is fueled by random runestones with inscriptions a simple goal set by the same plot but no matter how

how can it be that this is one of the best games ive ever played and its true valheim is the most addictive and fun game ive played lately in this game i went through amazing adventures faced many funny situations and intense battles and just had a wonderful time with my friends and the fact that the game is in early access shocked me same as when in the creators tab i saw that only 5 people were working on it and the fact that the game only takes up 1gb of hard disk space this is damn cool i think that the people who developed this game are just wizards

i experienced feelings similar to those when i played gothic 2 in my distant childhood more than 10 years ago very atmospheric music very beautiful lighting very understandable and enjoyable crafting and building system brutal combat system and hundreds of hours of world exploration after playing almost 100 hours i explored only 20 of the entire world that the game generates and the very fact of how diverse and interesting the game generates the world deserves respect there are tonns of the same locations but each of them is different from the previous one the world generation system is awesome and the most interesting thing is that in all this huge world i havent encountered literally a single game bug the only problem for me was optimization but this can be forgiven by referring to how gigantic the world is for realistic physics system for attention to details and for such a beautiful ingame night sky

at the end i would like to wish the developers not to grab a star fever  but to finish their brainchild until the end to bring all the ideas that remained in their heads into the world of valheim and may the odin be with them

i love this game but i might not be a typical gamer or even considered a gamer by the hardcore types and steam keeps bringing up the recommendation message

the reasons i love the game is it reminds me of being out and enjoying the outdoors while actually sitting in my house like a sloth stuffing my face full of snacks the graphics are not ultra great graphics and deliberately have a bit of a retro feel but the distance shots and blurring of landscape genuinely remind me of landscape views when walking 
i like the fact you can control the pace by your own exploration and avoiding terrains until you are ready bosses are not forced on you and you can legit just build cool bases for comfort in the elements there are however still some challenges and battles including bosses that are great multiplayer and playing multiplayer really adds to the game 
the combat system is simplistic and for gamers into the combat this may seem a bit hollow though the bosses do increase in difficulty and there are some elements of status damage and having to think how to really hurt a boss the main mechanic is dodge and hit in the right pattern but the game isnt really about the combat as the main draw just another element 
the game is an exploration game if you enjoy the idea of an open unexplored wild and untamed world to discover then this is the game for you also if you enjoy the idea of seeing how the algorithm builds a world and little places to discover which your own imagination can build upon then this is definitely the game for you 
if you want a fully fleshed out rpg story or world with interesting npcs then your looking at the wrong genre if your after a hardcore survival experience where your constantly against the elements this game isnt going to feel that hardcore if your after a combat focused game same applies think more sunday adventure meet up andor hike with your friends but with some cool fantasy elements

#####

this game doesnt need my positive review but it sure does deserve it its outstandingand im hooked ive played every day for the past 56 days and still going strong love exploring and building one of the best values for the money of all games currently in my library

#####

i didnt want to like it
then my boyfriend got it for us
then we convinced our clan to get it
then we convinced irl friendsfamily
we werent addictedwe could stop anytime we wanted to

terrible game do recommend

#####

this game is a sandbox masterpiece and if you like survival sandbox games you should buy this game and play it blindly
valheim gives that magical feeling like playing minecraft for the first time
my first day was pretty eventful valkyrie brought me into the world i started exploring and gathering rocks from the ground and punching small trees later i discovered some ruins of the house and decided to patch them and make them my home i walked in got poisoned by wasps and died xd then i respawned found a wasp nest and destroyed it after that i added some roof and furniture to that ruined shack and it became very cozy

valheim has pretty deep and interesting mechanics that are very engaging to learn for the first time i feel like the building itself will suck me in for 500 hours and there are also cooking brewing gardening crafting sailing taming fighting exploring

h1bear grylls meets vikingsh1
ivalheimi is a third person openworld survival game taking place in a mythical land between human world and valhalla the goal is simple prove your worth to the norse gods so they let you in however the journey will not be an easy one instead you will face off against the forces of nature on the open sea monsters and confusion as you will have no clue what to do next 

h3essentials for survivalh3
the base mechanics of ivalheimi are verywell known to the seasoned veterans of the survival genre find some wood and stones and make basic tools like an axe or a building hammer once you are armed with your first flint axe you are ready to chop down the weakest of the trees and open more crafting as well as building options this is where the first hurdle for unsuspecting players may appear every time you get a new material you can use in a crafting recipe it shows you all the possible things you can create at once this feels both overwhelming as well as confusing as suddenly your progression branches out into billion different directions you have no clue what leads to what crafting paths 

lets jump a bit forward you have a bunch of wood in your inventory and you start building your first base you are enjoying the viking aesthetic as well as upgrading to stone tools everything is fine before you realize that you do not know what to do next in terms of crafting progression your raft is not enough to survive the open sea your tools are not enough to chop down the trees and the game does not tell you at all what resources you need or where you could find them and so you are either stuck for numerous hours like me or you use the internet

in the background while you do your best to survive the great unknown your personal skills improve those range from running to fighting with specific weapons these skills improve simply by doing the action the skill represent the higher the level of the skill the more effective you are at these tasks better running means it will consume less stamina as well as slightly increase in speed

h3appeasing the godsh3
it is necessary to mention what is the correct way to impress the norse gods according to ivalheimi it is to kill 5 bosses of increasing difficulty each of the bosses when defeated give you a new power that makes certain tasks easier as well as a resource or a key to allow for crafting progression the bosses are well designed and mindlessly charging them will most certainly result in your death except probably for the first boss who mostly serves as a tutorial fight on top of that you need to sacrifice a specific item each time you want to summon the boss which can sometimes be very obscure and hard to figure out as for example you need to carefully read items description to choose the correct one

h3dying before valhallah3
death in survival games is a mixed bag in some it does not impact you at all in others it is a ground for restarting honestly ivalheimi is leaning towards the restarting side especially if you die in a tricky location surrounded by enemies simply put if you die you leave behind a gravestone where all the items you had on you rest on top of that your skills lose some of the gained experience but not a punishing amount

the issue comes when you die in a location with your best wish you luck if your only gear while being surrounded by 10 different enemies you might be asking why is that an issue the enemies do not despawn and so you repeat death run after death run trying to collect your items and just bolt it away except it is more annoying and painful than trying to pick up thors hammer if you are stuck in this position there are two options either you somehow make one of those death runs or you will have to half of the crafting progression again that includes killing the bosses again

h3you have my sword and my bow and my axeh3
combat in ivalheimi simply put feels sluggish every attack is very slow cancelling attacks is essentially impossible and blocking becomes a hit or miss as you have no clue whether your block with happen in time it has a high learning curve which is sometimes unnecessarily punishing you cannot go charging a horde of skeletons mindlessly because their numbers will simply overwhelm you it is a weird combination of making a strategic and slow combat with blocking and dodging being essential while throwing at you 5 enemies at once 

the combat shines the most at boss encounters or a single enemy encounter where you can use what the combat offers to its full potential and i did not even touch upon the fact that you are not told at all how to deal with status effects like poison etc so if you have no clue how to you will most certainly die to those numerous times

what balances out the negatives is the huge array of weaponry you can craft and utilize you have everything from bows to axes to halberd i think am not a viking weapons expert with this amount you can experiment and find the equipment that suits you the most somewhat balancing out the shortcomings of the combat system however speaking from experience the combat is way more manageable if you play with friends and each of you take up a different role 

h3audiovisual mythosh3
for an indie title ivalheimi makes the most of it even though the visuals are not hyperrealistic they still give a sense of reality while being vivid and alive the art direction shines the most when you are sailing the open sea accompanied by a soundtrack that perfectly reflects the current situation it gets tense when there is a storm brewing and very calm when you are just sailing the open sea without a care in the world everything in this game looks pretty there really wont be a sore sight for your eyes be it wide open plains deserts or endlessly looking seas 

h3here i come valhallah3
so we are at the end of our journey you must keep in mind that ivalheimi is still an early access title and developers are actively working on new updates therefore a lot of things are subject to change and should be treated that way overall despites its shortcomings is a great survival title especially if you play it with a bunch of friends and are willing to overcome the issues the game has the norse atmosphere accompanied by a great atmospheric soundtrack will lead to an adventure you wont just easily forget

i have played enough to know that this survival arpg is a fantastic experience
the gameplay is fun soundtrack is great world design is fantastic
dont let yourself be scared by the ps12 era of chosen style graphics
the world looks fantastic and is lush a huge world to explore

valheim is a suprise for me i knew i wanted to try it out when it was announced
but i did not expect it to be this fun

how do you sell 9 million copies and take 7 months to produce an update that has less content than what modders make in a few weeks and at the same time ruining how food influences stamina and health 
have fun waiting another 6 months for the devs to produce a second update that probably adds a pineapple and 2 types of doors
