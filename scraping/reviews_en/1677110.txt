mechwarrior retirement

#####

chill games like this make me feel like everything is going to be alright

#####

so after 16ish hours i have essentially completed early access
i have definitely moved slower than possible though so actual playtime may be 810 hours at this time

i do recommend this as a relaxing simple farming game the mech adds a neat take on having different farming tools the artstyle is nice and the gameplay loop is fairly simple

go to an area clean up all the poison and weeds harvest its resources use those to upgrade your mech and crafting capabilities this unlocks the ability to clean up hardier weeds or more toxic sludge

theres no combat your biggest enemy will be your mech stepping off a ledge and comically rolling down the hill that or accidentally falling into water which resets you to the last solid ground you were on

weeds and sludge will also occasionally try to attach to your farm which must be fought off with your tools else they eat your crops but this tends to happen only say once an ingame week

if youre looking for hardcore mech fighting or some kind of helldivers experience of conquering an alien world you wont get it here

if you want to walk around in a mech suit harvest some wood and ore and use it to build up a fun base with cosmetic furniture and a barn full of crafting machines then youll definitely enjoy it

seriously there is no fighting  its a pastoral game  its got some farming  like you know seedlings and all that

youd think a body wouldnt have to make that clear but every third post in steams forum right now is r i can fite alun or something  theres a run of people whove forgotten to read reviews or watch the games preview movies or am i even writing this for anybody other than myself  am i leaving myself a time capsule if i come back as a flesheating cyborg in the year 3027 and forgot what this game is

okay dear self  no u r not can fite alun


if thats driven off my future fleshhating self i think we may be safe  so listen  this is a game about farming

well like i said its a pastoral game  so theres farming theres meandering through forests or the seashore  sometimes evil seed capsules fall from the sky onto your farm plots but your mech vacuum cleaner can shloop them right out of the air  or theres nefarious blobbies that slow you down but you also carry a mechsized supersoaker  at worst your farm might be set back a bit but this is nothing a little collection cant fix  and if youve stripped a lot of the local resources feeding the local animals will hasten the rate the resources respawn 

you can supersoak your coop partners  it gives you a cheevo  but this is as violent as the game gets your pulse will never be at risk at accelerating at any point  accept that its a farming game and that only the most macho of men can play this and youll be fine  youll be as cool as me and im so macho i punched an m1a2 abrams to pieces  took me three punches  real life i mean  honest

the games visuals are lovely  the grass is like hypersaturated green  the sky is superblue  the wildlife is a little cute sometimes and a lot weird sometimes but theyre aliens its cool  and your mech looks like vintage farm equipment  its a bright cheerful game thats a nice antidote to all the terrible things going on in the news right now

if mech details matter to you its roughly heavy gear sized and its much easier to control than say something from mechwarrior  you move much like a first person shooter though with a bit of a delay as the legs rotate to the right direction  mouse look makes the legs automatch where youre going again with a bit of a delay  it will be natural for most of you and a little weird for me  i like to drive with a manual transmission all this automatic stuff disorients me

theres just a couple wrinkles in the game honestly


strike1 theres no keybinding  at all  i suspect it was probably meant to be console first pc second but seriously  no keybinding  the controls are reasonably fine if youre a righthanded keyboardist other than the weirdness of sprint being on shift  itll take a controller which is why my wife is still playing instead of having refunded it
strike
no sir keybinds got added today  i tried them out i have bound keys  marvellous  lefthanded and azertykeyboardusing players rejoice

2 the mech is basically a cylinder  it will fall over if you dont land on flat enough terrain or stub your shins or something  and then falling will tumble for awhile as the arms basically cease to exist  itll eventually stop rolling and you can flip it over but it is a trifle annoying

3 the map isnt that big  i mean its big enough all four players could make their own farms in the starter area with ample room to spare but it might take say ten minutes to walk across it  its a couple kilometers across perhaps  maybe playing it with four people is a bit much  but it is nice with the missus here


strike4 theres a commentator pip3r whos supposedly some kind of orbital robot thing but does little comments on your actions  getting  into a mech getting out of a mech placing a building etc  i dont mind but its a little much  that could stand to be dialled down a fair bit  maybe theres a setting i missed somewhere
strike
pip3r communication rates have been dialled down and she can be silenced altogether if thats your jam  i just didnt need the unintentionallysarcastic remember where you parked it every time i took a tumble in my mech and had to jump out to flip it  though it was funny the first dozen times

but thats all i got  it hits the mark im going to be a mech pilot tillin the fields and plantin the crops til the mech cows come home  pardner  were streaming our playthroughs as we go and i intentionally buried the link way down here  if you stuck with me maybe youd like to pop by and say hello  thatd be pretty cool  im at httptwitchtvfdejeuner and i keep a pretty consistent schedule

in the end this is a nice relaxing time  aside from the thought of future cyborgs attacking me through my reviews

i have a lot to say about this game but i dont wanna crowd a lot of this review with many paragraphs so let me just keep it all short and simple

is the game well designed yes

does it have great graphics and sound design yes

is it at an appropriate price yes

is it a relaxing game with no stress or strain yes

is it boring yes

so i guess im giving it a thumbs up because most of it is done well 

the gameplay is incredibly boring the entire function of this game is to go to a poluted segment of land a beach a forest some cliffs whatever and clean it up why because after you clean it up and feed the animals new resources spawn that you can use to upgrade your base and your mech

thats the entire gameplay component sure it has farming and building but its clear that the main objective of this gameplay is for you to save the planet one forest at a time using your super cleaning mech suit

i didnt really care for this gameplay idea too much it took me an hour to revive one forest all for one new resources and the entire journey to doing so was just kinda boring to me and knowing its just gonna be this over and over again didnt exactly help matters

is it relaxing and simple with no stress sure but its also kinda boring music was aweome though
is it worth its asking price for all thats there yeah justbe mindful of what youre getting yourself into

if youd like a more indepth look at the game with more information please check out the video on my youtube channel link below

otherwise thanks so much for reading and i hope i managed to help some of you out there spend your money wisely

what is survival if there is no danger calling lightyear frontier a survival game feels like an oxymoron because youre not exactly surviving anything try to drown yourself and youll just be transported back to the safety of shore throw yourself off a cliff and you wont take any fall damage theres no concept of damage at all actually despite this fps perspective and a mousewheel stacked with things that look and point like guns your goals are peaceful and it folds that non combative style into a game thats as tranquil as it is strategic

lightyear frontier uses the rituals of treepunchy basebuildy survival games to power an experience thats part cozy farm sim part adventure game and its a good one a pretty good one at least from what ive played

this is definitely an early access review for an early access game and whether or not its going to sound like a recommendation is going to depend on which of lightyears many genre labels youre here for im somewhere between an enthusiastic yes for lightyear as a strict farm sim and an enthusiastic yes but wait for lightyear as everything else it is 

it may sound like a superfluous distinction but one that im making because lightyear frontier serves more folks than just your coop do creative stuff with your mates types im about eight hours into a solo experience that used farming as the means not the ends and it was more fun than youd think for a few reasons

for starters this frontier is authored these beautiful horizons werent made with procedural generation this is a handcurated world with discrete named zones each with their own noncombative fauna flora and materials to gather

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3191971519

they also house some secrets to find lightyear frontier doesnt prioritize narrative but it does give you just enough of it to provide the game some direction outside of just crafting stuff ruins imply theres more history to the planet than it lets on and mysterious doors seem to respond well to all the cleaning youre doing

in lightyear frontier you play as a spaceguy who has found themselves crash landedvery luckilyon a planet rich in vegetation and poor in hazards you quickly meet a satellite that acts as a literal north star figure coaching you through the experience and youll slowly fall into the games routine of cleaning up the planet which helps you upgrade your mech and your crafting potential which helps you clean up the planet theres an almost powerwash simulatorlike feeling to that routine with no stakes predictable hosing and vacuuming happening between your farming

im not embarrassed to admit that it might actually be my favorite part of the game i dont have whatever gene inspires people to make the kind of beautifully fenced and proportioned farmsteads like the ones youll see in the screenshots the little crafting hubs i built were uh utilitarian but i am a sucker for vibe and lightyear frontier is a vibe delivery machine 

one of the most inspired choices is that these arent sleek anime mechs what youre piloting is closer to industrial farm equipment both in its look and in its function theres a lot of inertia when piloting you dont turn on a dime and the cockpit actually takes more time to rotate than the legs giving this illusion of weight

sometimes the mech is a bit more triphappy than feels appropriate but otherwise it gives the game a feeling of physicality that transports you to this world you can see that theme bubble up in other ways too like how changing your mechs limbs isnt abstracted through menus but instead something you perform by magnetically removing and applying new limbs with your tools

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3191971746

i like lightyear frontier so why did i only play eight hours thats where the nature of early access and reviews and recommendations intersect in some weird ways as a farm sim and platform for creative building theres way more than eight hours here with a level of polish and production that goes beyond that early access labeling and coop extends that even further

on top of having a story thats still in progress the biggest opportunities for lightyear frontiers early access sit with resource allocation and samey objectivesspecifically for the story stuff the crafting menus slowly onboard you by dripfeeding you new crafting patterns whenever you first find their components out in the world sometimes that dripfeed isnt drippy enough though there were times when i had patterns that demanded resources i hadnt found yet which is supposed to spur you into exploration and finding that resource but that exploration frequently feels aimless

that sort of craft whatever you find attitude just finds itself in contrast with major and obvious resource bottlenecks that exist in how the crafting is dished out to you where sometimes lacking one particular item puts the entire crafting system on hold until you find it which could be frustrating

the other low point is a recurring artifact acquisition objective ancient ruins scattered across the island house little secrets you can collect and their collection is usually married to some of the more lore and story based aspects of the frontier from a gameplay perspective theyre tedious you walk around and grab identical looking purple spheres and what makes this mindless busywork less fun than the rest of the games mindless busywork is that its not tied into your efficiency increasing and crafting ecosystem

it just feels a little divorced from the rest of the game and thats a shame because taking part in this objective gives little clues about the history of this land

h2 in conclusion h2

lightyear frontier sources inspiration from many different genres and its level of completeness and polish is going to feel different depending on which of those genres youre here for as a creative sandbox and coop farm sim its incredibly enjoyable its got a comfortable nostakes atmosphere its got a beautiful look and constantly reinforces friendly themes of frontier exploration rather than frontier subjugation


but theres also an early version of a cozy collection driven adventure here with progression and a story and twists and the irony is that this base experience was both bumpy and promising enough to warrant putting the game down theres an actual play it and complete it video game in here that i didnt want to rob myself of playing in eighteen or so months

therein lies the paradox of lightyear frontier and the paradox of early access i think i recommend lightyear frontier but im far more interested in the game it may become rather than the game it currently isand my own personal tastes leave me in optimistically follow territory rather than wanting to eagerly play every update

its a game thats already good but when its at the cusp of greatness id rather wait

i just hope that greatness isnt light years away

very cosy sandbox game which can be played with up to 3 friends but can be perfectly played solo also you can use your singleplayer file and host it so others can help in your game you have to clean up regions to make them prosper again gather resources to upgrade your novelty mech so you can venture deeper and clean up more regions it has a somewhat annoying texan ai helping you but if you ignore that one its a very nice relaxing game to play there are places where you need to solve a puzzle but its basically locate all the artifacts story wise it doesnt really tell a lot on who you are what you are doing exactly on that planet you are required to jump out of your mech when upgrading and going through hard to get places 

however i finished the current ea content at around 25 hours all upgrades on mech solved all ruins located all resources built a decent farm with decorations  now waiting for more content

this game feels like a game that can be played with your family brother sister parents kids its very friendly and very easy to understand a very basic upgrade system and cute animals to encounter however it is also very limited right now so the game really needs more content for me to keep playing it is definitely promising but it needs more content 

soundtrack is okay story is minimal gameplay is quite fun but limited the sandbox is also limited but more regions will be added later for now if you are looking for something new cosy and a relaxing adventure familyfriendly farming game this is your thing 

honestly 2025 euros for 25hours ingame isnt bad and this is ea so more content will be added in the future

this game is the best game that i have ever played i have autism spectrum disorder and the game developers have really done a great job when i play it i forget about everything it is a very good game for people like me  all in all this is a fantastic game there is so much to explore it is the best 30 i have spent in a long time best game ever

#####

super fun  unique farm game my only gripes are storage and the short days

#####

i aint got no friends to play with sadge its good tho at least

if you like games like slime rancher you should like this think its a good comparison

edit thanks for awards also the merchant wont bring me the rest of the lightning hot rod set reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee i just wanna kachow kachew lmao

#####

i love using continental war machines to grow alien cabbage

#####

although the game has pretty good vibes the game is barely different from the reveal trailer a year ago and even in whats different i prefer the reveal trailer version you had 2 working armstools at the same time you could use your downed ship as a starting base they also removed the weight indicator from ui so now you just suddenly get the overencumbered warning

i know its an early access title but the game is about 7 hours to complete and most of that is spent with either running back and forth between two ends of the map or sitting in place to get the time to pass to noon so you can go to sleep because youre waiting for the crops to grow or the oil press to spend 2 minutes per item processing

there fact that the mech keeps falling over every pebble in the way is just another nuisance
the trader is practically useless only sells seeds and vanity items and the seeds are only sold after they are discovered
i wish i could shut pip3r up about stomping around the critters i dont care about them im making my 7th trip for copper to the other end of the map
there is also a game breaking bug that if you dont sleep in a house at night then get out of the mech youre forced out of it when you get into the upgrade station you cannot get back in so you have to restart the game to fix it
there is also the misc find the stone and the ai tells you what the place was for side aspect of the game but thats even more underwhelming look around a landing site looking place for 16 stones  get a diary item stating that its a landing site  repeat about a dozen times

what were you guys even doing this past year since the reveal trailer

#####

beautiful open world sandbox farming game with mech tractors very similiar to the feel of playing slime rancher

the map is overall quite small but i feel that map doesnt need to be gigantic for the game to be good and the environment is very wellcrafted with a lot of detail there are also many other islands in the distance that look interesting and no doubt be explorable by the full release i dont personally see the map size as an issue as they have confirmed on the roadmap that a new area behind the dam should be explorable

gameplay is a very fun  polished experience for an early access title
the game progression is good as it entices you to explore the environment at your own pace and explore to find new resources for upgrading your mech
on the first days you could not rebind keys it had no shared inventory system and piper would talk too much but these have all been fixed showing that the devs care about player feedback which is excellent
the farming is very good and has a nice feel to it
graphics wise it still looks beautiful on the lower settings and is relatively well optimised aside from a couple bugs that cause frame drops furnaces mining etc

the only issues i have with intentional gameplay mechanics is when the mech topples over and you are forced to leave and flip it up every time which can be frustrating after a while just maybe as selfrighting upgrade would be nice and the event where the seeds fly in from above you as the only way to stop the seeds is with the mech and you cant completely look upright making it feel clunky and awkward
not as much of an issue but more of how the gameplay develops it would be nice to have more reason to exit the mech from time to time as mechs or vehicles in any game lose there special feeling when you have to use them too much and ends up feeling like the mech is just a tall character

one small thing that i would wish to point out is the fact it already has a dlc and i have no issue with it as it is to support the devs and have some extra cosmetics but i hope that by the full release it does not become spammed with dlcs to unlock a lot of the cosmetic items there has been too many games that have simply become this like space engineers and it completely ruins the games reputation especially on a game that is so focused on making your base and environment look pretty

concerning bugs it has many but it is to be expected for this stage of development just expect things to break every nowandthen or have slight setbacks with objects disappearing or becoming invincible but you shouldnt get anything too game breaking
multiplayer is very buggy and additionally seems to crash the host from time to time but is playable

overall a great game that could potentially be the best relaxed farming game ever made if they continue in the right direction convince your best friend to buy it too like i did and go have some fun 

#####

love me mech
love me farm
hate pollution
simple as

#####

titanfall 3 is pretty chill so far

#####

bthisb is by far the most stable early access game in a long while
cozy and beautifull to look at steady progress in story and what you can do around the map
it has a lot of love for details like the switch on your watering tool moves when u use it and being able to color most things how ever you like it
progressing in the game is relativly easy but why shouldnt it be you can lean back enjoy your time and create your own little place the upgrates for you tools make sense and i love that


ibroiyou can icostimizei your mechwith so many diffrent parts iat the same timei 3


#####

incredibly relaxing has a bit of a stardew valley feel to it

#####

great game i love the concept farming but youre in a mech how has noone else thought that up before that being said though the mech controls could use a little fine tuning when sprinting mostly when trying to corner or make last second turns the mech handles more like a pile of bricks it also has the tendency to just run a little too far too fast sometimes maybe the x button on keyboard could be like an ebrake lastly being able to upgrade sprint speed is nice but how about a upgrade for walking speed too i lost count of how many times i had to trudge back to base at a crawl because i collected every single resource node in sight

#####

i always wondered what it would feel like to be a mouse in a human suit  now i know  the idea of the game is fun  the graphics look good  the touch points are there for a survival game  the perspective is weird  wandering around out of the mech it feels like youre suddenly a mouse size object  some items are relative to your size but some items dont seem to be that way  then when you get into your people suit youre the size of a normal human on this planet  

idk if id recommend others to play yet  it needs some fine tuning  maybe the environment team and the mech team need to swap shoes for a day  they leaned into the visual aspects of farming tech but they can do so much more and it feels like its also holding back the game  too many safe plays and not enough adventure

#####

ive been watching lightyear frontier for a year now and it didnt disappoint in its early access debut a good chunk of regions and about 15 hours of gameplay to 100 everything 

if youre looking for a solid game thats chill and lets you explore craft and build a little homestead  highly highly recommend

#####

slime rancher without the slime and with more rancher

#####

love this mech farming in a beautifully polished chilled world what more can you want to unwind after a hard days work

#####

farmoured core 

#####

i have been playing this game with my girlfriend and so far we absolutely love it 

the gameplay is smooth and the controls are easy to pick up the animals are cute asf which keeps her entertained as she adores animals 

the graphics are so nice and the colors are so pretty 

overall such a fun game looking forward to seeing more

#####

very chill and relaxed game the map is very well done also and great to explore

#####

i played this game for 10 hours straight and i enjoyed every second 

#####

ba cool concept but missing a lot of important quality of life improvements as well as real content it very quickly gets boring and frustrating pretty but empty
it needs more time in development to be worth playingb

in the end i got sick of getting in and out of my mech every minute to craft things and pick up the items then constantly building demolishing and rebuilding things because you cant move existing structures to make them actually fit inside my base zone that i just closed the game 
i wont play it again until it gets the qol features it desperately needs and some real content to make them worth using


the moment i started the game the first thing i heard was an extremely jarring voice from the robot that talks to you and this thing talks constantly every time you fall over run into a tree build something feed an animal go to sleep get in or out of your mech basically anything you do its infuriating one of the first things i did was go into the settings and turn voice volume to 0 because its that annoying

from the store page and the videos it seems like the main focus of the game would be farming but it isnt really farming is the first step of all crafting in the game because you need the crops which you then turn into oil but farming takes very little effort or time you have to water the crops every day if it isnt raining as well as harvesting them but watering harvesting planting seeds and fertilising them is extremely quick  this feels like a good thing because it gives you more time to craft build or explore but then you realise that none of those things have any substance to them either
i think the game would be better with a stronger focus on farming but it needs all of these things to be more interesting first and they just arent

the way progression works in this is you use the vacuum and water hose on your mech to suck up weeds or wash away slime in different areas then at the end of the day those areas become clean and you have to go to animal nests to feed the animals in order for new resources to spawn 
the problem is that the very first resource you need after aluminium is copper which only spawns in the smallest region on the map and because the resource doesnt actually spawn until you have cleansed the area and fed the animals it was really hard to find it i went around the entire map through all of the areas before finally finding the one spot where copper spawns 
i very nearly closed the game and refunded it because of how frustrating this was but i finally found it before then


uthe thing that actually did make me quit is the item managementu

your mech is the thing that actually carries your items and it can hold an infinite number of items but has a base weight limit of 60 if you go over that you cant sprint or jump in the mech thats fine besides the few times you might get stuck because of it but you can always drop items however this means that when youre crafting a lot of items you have to keep getting in and out of your mech to suck up the items or carry the items 8 at a time to your mech 
the game desperately needs some automation and logistics to fix this

the main issue is that all of the storage options available at the start of the game can only hold 60 weight like the unupgraded mech rather than having a limit to item number for things like crops and oils its not so bad but you need a lot of all of the metals woods and stone to do anything in the game and you need several crates just for each of those resources 
you can eventually make a silo that can hold 900 weight of a single item type but these are annoying to make because of the resources you need to craft them these are also massive and take up far too much space  with such an awful storage system the best storage should not be so tedious to make and too big for the base area around your house

another issue is about the houses when you place your house it has a zone around it where if storage cratessilos are placed inside it crafting stations in the zone will be able to pull from those crates the zone gets bigger for each house upgrade but its far too small for the early houses especially because you also need to build decorations inside the zone to get certain buffs

#####

so this is what imperial knights used to do in the golden age of technology


its a fun quaint cozy farming game with a catch well its a big one and lumbers abouta mech

overall in my small time playing i did play the demo during nextfest i enjoy it and can easily recommend it to anyone who likes a cozy farming game

#####

this game is an absolute gem  it is a perfect mix of things like a lovechild of slime rancher mech games and farming sims  but most of all it is just such a complete joy to play  have not hit one frustrating moment just pure fun  pack a bowl and enjoy

#####

its very polished there is no fighting no killing so if youre an action packed only type of player you will not enjoy this game but if you love beautiful graphics in a beautiful setting with great music and an excellent gameplay loop you will enjoy this game quite a bit its so relaxing and the polish is something that all games should strive for the fact that they got it more polished than 90 of full release games before they would even release it to early access shows me that these people love and care for their game ive seen a few instances of this in the last couple of years its so wonderful to see care coming back to video games after a long run of mostly bad games

#####

this game is great for a cozy gamer who likes a chill exciting and progressive type playstyle

#####

i enjoy farm sims quite a bit that being said i just dont like how this is setup a lot of the customization are pretty bland and the stuff you build is just items you spawn in place my biggest issue is the map size is tiny i explored 2 of the areas completely almost immediately and there are only few more almost like the map was built for the human size but then the mechs just make it seem even smaller

id maybe recommend trying on gamepass first

#####

beautiful game but it has little content 

#####

i will say up front there are some weird animations example swinging the saw about

but i will say im loving this game so far mechs and farming are an interesting way to do it

totally need an engineering phd for farming mechs lol

#####

awesome game played for 3 days restored all regions done all upgrades and im left with the last achievement hope the developers release an update soon

#####

if you are looking for a stress free game to play for a a few hours at a time this game is for you while its early access its extremely polished and everything in the game fits together nicely it took me about 9 hours to finish the current story right now only the first act is in the game and about 15 hours to clear the map and unlock everything except all the mech customizations the only issue with my early copy was one of the npcs that gives quests was bugged but thats supposed to be fixed for launch so that should add a few more hours of content

heres my 2 minute review if you want to hear a little more before buying httpsyoutubevnwokqk4vfy

#####

very relaxing a great game if you had a stressful day and just need to wind down and hangout with your friends while you clean up a planet build your farm and discover ancient secrets extremely polished i cant say the last time i played an early access game this well made off the rip well done developer

#####

game is cozy maybe too cozy cant help but get eepy

#####

hoping more content is added later its a little bare as of now its still fun id say its like slime rancher in terms of feel and stardew in terms of gameplay its a great game to load up and just vibe for an hour or so at a time as you build a little homestead and feed the wild ratscallions

#####

very mecha farm

#####

i completed everything there is to complete in just under 16 hours of almost continuous gameplay the gameplay loop reminds me a lot of stardew as it pertains to planting and watering crops in the morning i enjoyed the exploration and the progression of materials and upgrades which felt steady and fair i am however a bit disappointed by the lack of content considering ive seen everything there is to see in less than 20 hours i understand the devs have plans to add more content to the game and you can tell because there is an undiscovered part of the map which isnt available yet its a great relaxing game to dump a weekend into but thats about as much as youll get out of it in the current state

#####

fantastic and cozy game i rushed through it in 12ish hours casual play and time for cosmetics you can easily stretch out this early access to 20 hours

some minor bugs like the vacuum yeeting the components across the map but nothing gamebreaking very polished for early access

45 had alot of fun with this one cant wait to see what they do with new content

#####

awesome game vibrant colors beautiful shaders and lighting fun game mechanics i feel like im playing terarria fighting the corruption while in the robosuit of subnautica in a big ass realistic minecraft world amazing

#####

its another open world sandbox builder this time youre in a mech the concept sounds fun but in practice its pretty tedious most of my time is spent wandering around looking for a resource or waiting for the next day to pass so the resources i need for a part grows i mean thats pretty typical for these games but its like do i really want to go through another iteration of it content seems a bit sparse too its like youre invited to some kids sandbox and theres already a big sand castle and youre only allowed to build your own stuff around his

#####

kept refreshing the store page just to see when i could purchase the game loved the demo so much that i just needed more lightyear frontier is a wonderful cozy title with an excellent amount of customization options and a sense of discover that will pique your intrigue to the point where youll be running back to your homestead to make room for all the new materials youll discover

#####

this feels like a labor of love project heres to hoping it just keeps getting better

#####

this game is absolutely amazing very low key and not stressful it is amazing to have another game that you can play with friends that isnt battling enemies and can just vibe the animals are amazingly cute and the world is stunning the music is also really killer i could see this game going really far and hope the continue to expand on it i think any bad reviews on this game do not keep in mind that it is early access you do not have to get out of your mech to craft things truly very excited for the developers and the team that worked on this game they are doing a great job keep it up and keep expanding

#####

great cozy game cant wait to see what this game has in store in future updates 

#####

sadly the game bored me to tears i just didnt get enough from the crafting system or things to do to really suck me in far too slow and meticulous i respect whats here though and ill be keeping an eye on development

really needs to dig deeper into mech customization and look into the multiplayer resource economy right now how resources spawn back is just grating

i wish i had a neutral review but i personally dont recommend it

#####

lightyear frontier is an absolute gem of a game gfx are beautiful game play was smooth and fluid i highly recommend this game its a nice relaxing chill game that you can play solo or with friends i absolutely love this game

#####

priceappropriate visually stunning relaxing game hovewer

lack of comprehensive tutorial or ingame guidance which can make it difficult for new players to understand the game mechanics controls and objectives without clear instructions you may feel overwhelmed and struggle to progress leading to frustration and discouragement a more structured onboarding process or interactive tutorials could significantly improve the learning curve for beginners

while the initial gameplay experience in lightyear frontier may be engaging the game suffers from a lack of diversity in its mechanics environments and objectives you may find yourself engaging in repetitive tasks such as resource gathering crafting and exploration without meaningful variations 

bugs glitches and performance optimization problems tthese issues range from minor inconveniences to more severe problems like crashes or freezes a good example would be the significant drop of frames when the player performs a certain action such as cutting trees or destroying specific types of rocks

the game could benefit from a deeper and more engaing narrative framework supported by quests and storylines currently the games narrative elements may feel underdeveloped introducing compelling characters meaningful choices or even branching storylines could enrich the player experience and provide a sense of purpose and progression beyond simple exploration and farming mechanics

#####

its mechs and its farming also a slower pace game really a fun break away from the usual

#####

it is a peaceful game but not as advertised  it is a slog and annoying mechanics make you run around constantly encumbered and confused and annoyed  i am sure the game will see improvements but right meow it is impossible for me to enjoy

#####

absolutely amazing game

just the right amount of simplicity just the right amount of complexity it already has its hooks deep

#####

great chill mech farming gathering and market selling for cosmetics game

#####

so the main selling point of the game is a mech which is absolutely boring and not fun to operate and experience
man in subnautica the mech was like 10 of all available features

#####

so to preface this i want to mention that ive spent around 12 hours playing the demo the 16 minutes spent on the ea release of the game was mainly to see if any userrequested changessuggestions were implemented for the ea launch

i cant recommend the game in its bcurrent stateb while i had a blast with the demo and only had 1 major gripe with it the storage items capacity being limited by weight instead of slots the fact that it was unchanged is a huge turn off for me tldr if you like hoarding youre in for a bad time ill go further into detail about it below for those curious but i would say wait until after the game gets a few updates so that the game mechanics can be properly tweakedflushed out that being said if the explanation below is a nonissue for you then by all means get the game


for context the storage containers can only hold up to 60 weight units you can refer it to as lbs kgs etc  take your pick the issue being that something like stone weighs 09 kgs per item which means your storage container can only hold 66 stones with a remaining 06 kgs for anything else you want to throw in there if you want to do any kind of largescale builds or just want to stockpile certain items youre going to need multiple storage containers that will only hold a single type of item despite the storage interface taking up 13rd of your screen

#####

as someone who sometimes get motion sickness in games i want to thank the devs for adding a slider for head bob and screenshake great features most devs miss and there from day 1 of ea too i think this says a lot about the level of polish on the game even at ea release 

ive only played 4hrs so far but am enjoying whats in the game it has a nice laid back cozy feel and the use of a mech is something innovative for the farming genre i wasnt sure how id feel about the use of the mech when watching the trailer but im finding it really fun now playing with my 10yo daughter and shes loving it too only point to improve would be that it would be nice if you didnt roll the mech quite so often

graphics are great and performance is too ive only got a gtx 1080 and a 10yo i7 cpu but i can run this on high with a steady fps of 4060 which seems fine for this game 

no bugs hit so far game seems well polished for ea

highly recommended to anyone that wants a cozy farming basebuilding game with a picturesque landscape and cute creatures

#####

the starts is a bit boring but after that it picks up and for this type of game it is really good the mech interactions and how you some times get off it to get stuff and return to it is really well done perfect for a relaxing evening of gaming i only got it because i show it had a demo played it and found that this is exacly the kind of game i wanted to play i say try the demo if you like it perfect if not move on just give it some time to get throw the first boring parts

#####

its one of the best games for farming unlike most farming games it has a mech and its fun have fun 

#####

tldr upfront
worth the 20 early price  yes
game is ready for full release  no

this game is gorgeous has a lot to build off of a lot of great ideas here however

the weight system is awful storage boxes are so limited and the upgraded storages are the same size as the basic ones so its not even worth building anything other than the start crates

the mechs have extremely limited jump ability and the sprinting gets really janky real fast

minor visual bugs when in third person mode with the mech and vacuuming stuff

there is no personal inventory you have to shoot the items at your mech to carry things

paintscustomizations are limited and feel janky to apply

upgrade paths are based off of items you collect but the stations and costs to build certain things areweird

mech upgrades are insanely expensive and time consuming be aware that not only can you not necessarily chainproduce a lot of things but you also need a metric ton of things to buildup your inventory with stuff to do the mech upgrades very unsatisfying system

overall 710 will change review rating to 10 when things are addressed and fixedchanged
recommend  only if  they fix and change a handful of issuesbugssystems before full release

#####

im giving this one a conditional thumbs up on the condition that the devs add more to the game i have no reason to believe otherwise so giving them the benefit of the doubt

the core loop of the game is fun and i really enjoyed it during my time exploring clearing areas finding new resourcesplants is good system

that said though  as it stands in early access even going in totally blind and without looking up any guides or tips i was able to finish everything solo besides grabbing every treasure item in a pretty casual 1011 hours that includes getting all the upgrades buying all the mech parts and decorations and building a nice housefarm

some small issues andor comments for the devs 

1 why do flowers and glo trees die and need to be replanted after being harvested ive made sure to water them i give them space  i just dont really understand this mechanic at all
2 i think the traversal upgrades run speed and jet boost should be available much earlier in the list as by the time you get them youve already been everywhere and most likely gotten every other upgrade completed


#####

graphics great
mechanics interesting but very quickly repetitive
gameplay interesting but very quickly repetitive
story good enough

do i recommend not really i did not find it personally very interesting
reaching a new area and having to clear what feels like 100 noxious slime is a chore
finding and opening artefacts  is a chore

many things in this game are just pretty and cosmetic the mech body parts are all cosmetic
when upgrades are gates to more progress its just very frustrating going into new areas and not being able to do anything there
when the resources you need only unlock after an area is cleared for you to progress this is also exhausting
going out to collect the resources you need and having to walk back being carrying to much is just annoying
building structures and needing the items in your inventory and not being pulled from boxes is also annoying

the farming and its related unlocks is fun i would lean into this angle with more mechanics and scaling the game up

overall the game just drained me too much

#####

i wish i could have gotten a bit farther in 2 hours but the game is pretty slow for you to have any meaningful progression based off my experience this could be fun but pretty repetitive there are some missing quality of life features like using items from chests when building and marking on map resources i dont think i saw enough to really keep the game and try it later on so im refunding it

i had to add in dang is the narrators voice annoying she speaks every time you do something for real just let me do things in peace

#####

the idea is cute but the execution is lacking it feels like a strage copy of slimerancher tbh

i know this is an early release and so a work in progress however the controls of your charactermech are so clunky and unenjoable it was actually making me stressed you alsoo have to step on resources to pick them up pair that with the clunky controls and it was just a nightmare

thre is a lack of a tutorial i dont mind exploring and learing through that in fact i enjoy it but a little guidanceexplenation would be nice like what do the artifacts do am i supposed to just collect everything and store it for a potential future use why am i feeding the nests why cant i mark things on the map foor future refrence

its definitely not worth 20 in this state so much so that im requesting a refund

#####

first thing i want to say in this review is that the polish style and care that went into this game is wonderful if youre just looking for another survival farming sim like any other then dont worry about the downvote here its an alright farm sim with nothing insanely offensive in it

my issues with this game come in the fact that other games do everything this game has already theres very little unique aspects to this game despite the giant glaring mech feature seemingly stating otherwise its just a normal farm sim where happen to have a smaller you inside of your character 

for those who want more details im very wordy but ill try to offer as coherent info as i can below

hrhr

h2explorationh2	
standard region exploration with regions and their resources being unlocked through your actions over time

movement is not affected by the mech much you have a jet jump as your only jump option you can trip over rocks and need to flip your mech over too the latter of which is cute but annoying and just mindless tedium sometimes

you can level up move speed and jumping but these are nothing amazing just slight improvements the only thing that makes me feel like im in a mech here are tripping hazards and weight momentum

h2gatheringh2
this is also your standard fare my biggest complaint here is your mechs carry weight starter carry weight is 60 no lbskg attached so unsure a single stone for reference is 09 meaning starting out you would be encumbered at 66 stones 

for added math a few crafting benches take anywhere between 10 to 20 stonesyou gather more than stone of course which leads to either facing multiple trips or one very slow boring one i often go for the latter even with the upgraded capacity of 120 as you go further the later in game you get so you carry more

so the space age tractor mech has the carry weight of a wheelbarrow what about your human well you dont get any your only inventory is your mech if you gather resources on foot then you need to pick it up and bring it to your mech

h2farmingh2
biggest attraction here in the game is your mechs ability to autoaimplant seeds and big splash water to water multiple crops these are fun flavours that mechanically do little differently than any other farming game

crops are just a crafting resource or something to sell and watering them is likely one of the biggest chores in the game as your water tank capacity isnt very much there are no water wells and a full tank of water is often not even close to enough to water all your crops so this means several trips to whatever closest body of water your base is near every day

h2crittersh2
you may have noticed there are cute critters in this game they are cute and each region has 3 types using specially made biscuits you can feed them and feeding 3 of a single type increases that regions resource spawns the next day by a  amount this is a small kind of fun mechanic that unfortunately like your mech holds little weight

my ability to get the resources i need are often more at odds with my carry weight than it is my ability to find them so while these critters are cute their one and only mechanic is a day buff planned in advance for something thatll likely lead to an overencumbered walk home


h2addendumh2
im a very wordy person and ive not entirely offered constructive critiques here but i do hope the devs do more with this game the idea is a good one and the art direction is great

but everything here feels forced into the filter of a mech your pick and axe watering crops planting seeds making paths having an inventory even is delegated to the mech gimmick it would be worth it if it did something fun and powerful feeling but i barely feel like im in fallout power armour let alone a scifi exoplanet colonizer mech

its a 3 out of 5 star game not bad but its an average farm sim game at best and i wouldnt even compare it to other mech games



#####

game freezes every three seconds when it doesnt have internet access

#####

my feelings on lightyear frontier as of this moment are complicated but i not only think the ea release is worthwhile for the asking price but offers enough baseline content going forward that being said i have my issues with the current state of the game 

lets start with the good stuff world design is beautiful the bubbly colorful feel of the landscapes and scenery really lends itself to the artstyle and vibe of the game 
the music is perfect for this genre of game it has a relaxing and calm feel that lets you relax while doing your daily watering andor harvesting 
the mech feels mechy it has weight behind its movement and it feels powerful the outside of the mech gameplay is acceptable its evidently not a primary focus and as such is only what it needs to be 
the currently available structures are nice and fit the overall rustic scifi vibe and work well both functionally and decoratively

now for the stuff im eh about the building is nice but needs some work specifically in regards to rotation and clipping rotation is jagged and not very smooth meaning you can have a hard time making things line up correctly
the road making is serviceable but not practical beyond an aesthetic choice it doesnt appear to speed up movement and the means of placing them is very slow and at times very inconsistent in how it looks based on terrain
progression could be clearer in regards to how to unlock certain things some items list things that require them but arent actually unlocked until well later in the current story 

now the bad thankfully there isnt much here but world scale is where id start the world itself while beautiful is very weirdly scaled and makes it seem more like the mech is how tall you should be and when you hop out youre an ant its really weird and throws me off 
the map and travel the map is surprisingly small yet also takes what feels like a very long time to travel across there are no methods of fast travel or hastier ways to move across the map additionally there appears to be no way to place or create custom markers for stuff like resources which is very important to be able to mark in a game 
resources as mentioned before to my knowledge is is currently not possible to mark resource locations and resource regeneration is tied to either time or giving food to animalstheir nests this is a good way to do this but without easy ways to keep track of where things spawn specifically it can be a hassle and bordering on not worthwhile to try and regenerate resources 

to summarize the game has a lot of potential and is enjoyable in its current state if youre fond of slow paced games where youre not always focused on it 100 however it needs some refining around the edges and some simple qol additions i am excited to see how the game develops and it is a wonderful addition to my library

#####

this game looks great but it lacks content even for an early access

#####

very pleasant and relaxing to play i wish they could add more contents like irrigation system several trips to whatever closest body of water to our base back and forth every day is annoying as hell and growing our cattle 

so far i love it and pretty excited for future updates

#####

great gameplay loop amazing art styledesign soothing music and a good price

fork the money over for this one 

#####

great game so far for an ea a big playground to mess around in only two gripes i have atm are just personal ones im not a fan of the tractor mech design and pipers accent drives my nerves up a wall with all that said cant wait to see what the end game is like

#####

i really enjoyed this game it was alot of fun but sadly not alot of story so be prepared for it to be short
what you will get though is a pretty well optimised and polished game with lots of love poured into the animations and assets
i look forward to future content and finally collecting all the mech parts
for more info i have a video review here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdz17cty4os

#####

the tldr of this review is going to be if you dont see me playing this some other game has its hooks in me otherwise this is pretty much going to be a goto for me whenever i need to chill its ithati nice also please note that ive folded a lot of time into the game pass version as well so

anyway

sit down kids and let me tell you a story of a little playstation 2 game called steambot chronicles or bumpy trot for those of you who might be more familiar with the og name a fun little game where besides the mech combat the idea was just to live your life whether that be transporting goods or making a profit off of things or you get the idea your main method of transportation was a trotmobile a mech much like the bot youll be piloting here in lightyear frontier a little clunkier to control but then it was ye olden days when twinsticks on a controller were a moderately newfangled thing

i bring up steambot chronicles because this game touches on something that i thought was long gone from mechabased gaming heart this game is steambot chronicles for a new generation and that makes my heart sing

youre looking at your usual survival crafter here but with one notable twist not even a stitch of danger to be seen

there is no combat in lightyear frontier unless you count vacuuming up floating weed spores or spritzing toxin bubbles that threaten to gloop your homestead with gunk thatll slow you down but otherwise those are more just events to get another form of crafting material for fairlystrictly glamour items thus far the world is strictly your graduallyopening sandbox to explore revel in and gather from that being said the groundwork is there ironically enough from all of the upgrades we have thus far that they could bplease dontb squeeze in combat if they so desired

movement is weighty and clunky but in an appealing way once you get used to it youre piloting what amounts to a big fuckoff bipedal tractor so it does make sense after you come to grips with the machine though its surprisingly easy to keep momentum on your side if you want to just make tracks well not if you iliterallyi want to make tracks which you can do with another upgrade

which turns me to customization and upgrading a lot of qol upgrades for the mech like movement speed jump height and things like multilockon and a splashing mortar water bomb for when you want to just get your planting and watering done and dusted you wont be customizing joejane q farmer piloting the mech though all of that is strictly mecharelated with a fun collection of parts and paints you can mix and match knightthemed wooden a grungy biker aesthetic within reason considering the colorful world

and the environment ithe environmenti if the farming homestead creation and the mecha are the jewels in the crown the beautiful world is the gold setting not much in the way of interesting npcs yet that ive run into merchant once you get to that point some dude with a leaf for hair giving you requests once you get to that point what im talking about is the vibrancy of the planet the animals just kinda skittering around their nests and doing their things the ruins you can plumb for artifacts to find out more about the civilization that lived here before you arrived

this is why i call it steambot for a new generation the blueprint is spread out and i can tell theres the potential for that exact same game that shaped my opinion of sliceoflife games ever since to have a second life in a downright lovely nostress sim

i cannot suggest this game enough if you enjoy just relaxing the music the vibe the lack of pressure

even when not discounted its practically pizza money cmon

#####

on one side after playing the demo with a release of date i do not know why but i thought that a release date did not mean early access 01x  
severely disappointed in that  

i am so so so very tired of ea games it felt like a play demo and hah we are nowhere close but thanks for the money anyway

that being said  it is still a fun game in present state
very peaceful  ill keep playing  as long as i get my 1 paid per hour played  its worth the cost  

but my word ea is going to kill the industry  


edited review
i finished the current build
it took around 13 hours    every upgrade and every zone  minus 1 achievement
not quite worth the price yet of 20 as i still firmly believe 1 should  1 hour 

great concept though  
ignore the reviewers wanting some kind of fps challenge  there is a mystery farming resource base building amazing base here  
ill be coming back at 05 and again at 10


#####

titanfall 3 looking great

#####

at first like any incremental game it starts slow but it gets better along the way some elements of the game could be made clearer to players and some could be improved but im very happy with what ive seen so far

#####

first of all this is one of these cases where i wish steam would have a neutral rating option

it is a nice game but for me it isnt quite there yet especially for the price
it is early access so there is hope things are getting fixed

bbugsb
 my mech constantly gets stuck at the mech upgrade station
 one of tutorial quests got stuck so i had to start over

bperformanceb
 my rtx 3070 is constantly at 100 usage
 but no lag or stutter

bantiqolb
 you have to wait the 2s the tool switch animation needs to play when switching tools which is especially annoying when you are collecting ressources and are constantly switching tool
 your mech can stumble over rocks which means you have to hold e to get out of it hold e to place it upright again and hold e again to get back into it
 as soon as you wanna work in more than 2 biomes you need friends otherwise the time a day has is just too short

bvibeb
 fun and chill music
 cute critters
 well the voice over is hitormiss  the clean voice with an southern accent feels mismatched  for me either a clean voice without the accent or a raspy voice with the accent would fit better but i know this is highly subjective

bcontentprogressionb
 there seems to be a ton of content
 sadly it seems every single item is hardlocked behind some kind of progression mechanism wanna build the trader landing pad  needs red crystals  needs cleanup of biome for regen of resources also needs better tool  needs certain oil  needs certain crop  needs certain seed also needs certain building  needs another crafted resource  needs mined resource  needs to feed critters for better regen of resources  needs food  needs another oil  needs to collect a bunch of bushes 
yeah you need some kind of progression but it feels kind forced as if there isnt enough content so you have to grind for every little bit and that despite the trailer showing so much of it

overall i can only give my usual recommendation for early access get it if you wanna support the development but wait if you want to play a full and polished game

#####

for a new game that has only recently been released in early access this game is pretty good  it is seriously relaxing especially if you dont want to protect your crops at all costs against the weeds and spores that occasionally fall from the sky in the morning  having to return to ones base on those days in time to destroy the weeds is the only real constraint in the game this may change with time but right now it is a relaxing game that causes no stress there are loads of decorative items to craft  and you can spend many enjoyable hours upgrading and decorating your base

#####

its so fun to just play such a relaxing game that will reward you for your efforts and i love how you are able to make your base look anyway you want and all the different decoration items there are this game is definitely worth a play and can strangely become addictive

#####

rtx 3070 64 gigs of ram i7 and all settings are under high and i tried frame breaking and it still does it im at a loss i have tried to see if my graphics card needs updating and that isnt it at a loss of what to do i am also using 3840x2160 uhd the issue is that i am seeing cones of graphic glitches but it is only happening in that temple once i restore all biomes

#####

pure kino 
calm nice no screaming no blaming no backstabbing no double standards no douchers no cheaters just nice 
this game is comfort food for the soul so good in fact im surprised nintendo didnt make it 
this helped me find an inner peace i thought was lllooonnng gone 
i never ever thought id enjoy another game ever again id given up on that idea back in 2021 i was perpetually miserable nothing made me happy not division 7days2die overwatch not even metal fatigue 
nothing i had made me happy and i spread that misery around 
i didnt care what i was playing and there was nothing they could say to make me 
my heart was just never in it and i brought the people i played with down 
i needed something and i still dont know what exactly but this was it 
i love to look at the sunrises before taking off into a field on my giant mech 
the little kid in me was beyond elated to run across those morning sun kissed fields of vibrant grass just like i did when everything was okay when everything was so much simpler 
the music is 1110 hearkening back to a time when i would wake up in a house full of my people grandma making breakfast and the summer days were lllooong lazy and ours for the taking 
give it a try 
you dont have to be miserable 
things can get better 
it does get better

#####

im rating this off of the fact that its early access if this was the full game i wouldve given it a neutral rating if it existed there just isnt all that much to do and it does get repetitive i do have high hopes for it though if they just add a few more layers to it like a story combat or puzzles it will be a great game

#####

yeah if i could get this games soundtrack on vinyl that would be great

also mecha tractor go brrrrrrr

#####

crashed so hard i lost a file save but in all fairness it a good relaxing game sadly i aint relaxed because i never learn how to relax

#####

very laid back need more great game

#####

this game follows a simple cycle of gathering resources in one area upgrading and then moving on to the next area there are currently no battles or automation elements
despite its simple gameplay the process of gathering resources and streamlining is addictive and i found myself losing track of time
at this point the game can feel a bit monotonous im looking forward to new areas and features being added in future updates

#####

very wholesome and relaxing

#####

i started playing on day 1 with my wife it took us 12 hours to reach the end of the story and fully upgrade my mech im waiting for the full release this was a very fun game with great multiplayer

#####

great cozy game to fall back on if you need to pass time between games

basically one of those types of games where when you find an item for the first time you learn new recipes

also you have a mech to ride around in and upgrade

#####

having a blast with this nice and chill game with good progression speed through upgrades

#####

even in early access this game is well fleshed out after 6 hours ive come across 1 bug and it gave me extra resources so no big deal the game hasnt crashed once and it performs well 

its still early access so dont expect a detailed storyline to follow but if you want a relaxing time forging the frontier and farming the wilderness then this if for you

#####

i really think everyone should have a game like this in their library a relaxing peaceful farming  building game it has an addictive gameplay loop a surprising amount of missions and a pretty large map all for you to explore

i really like the idea of bringing the planet back to life and feeding the wildlife to help regenerate natural resources faster for you to continue mining and farming 

also the mech is a very neat idea and it adds a lot of value to the game the upgrades alone make it worth while the fact you can turn it into a pure farming machine is great but even better is the movement it controls like how you would expect a mech to control and i cant even count the amount of times ive seen this thing fall over and start rolling down a hill lmao 

now onto the negatives i really dont have any i havent encountered any bugs crashes performance issues or game design that i dont agree with i seriously cannot think of a single negative as of now edit i actually remembered one i couldnt find any way to rebind keys so if youre not a wasd player or you dont like one of the keybinds youre just kinda screwed for now hopefully thisll get patched quickly 

im still only really at the start 6 hours in i have a few upgrades and a tiny farm the map isnt gigantic but its certainly big thisll definitely keep you busy for at least 20 hours very much worth the price

#####

h1 a great game for a great price h1 

h3 very addictive h3

the fact that this is considered early access in this state is bcrazyb id believe this was a full release if you told me everything in this game just works and feels responsive while also having graphics that are clean this game scratches an itch i havent felt in a long time reminds me of the wonder i felt for slime rancher when it was in early access it doesnt feel bottlenecked and the progression doesnt hold your hand uat allu there are still some minor bugs to squash but this already feels very well put together a great game for a great price i cant wait to see what comes next

#####

i love this game so far i played the demo before it came out and thought it was amazing i was in for a supersize when the full game came out i love the attention to detail and design i am super exited to see where the game goes its like titanfall before the imc

#####

nice an cozy game

#####

lightyear frontier is a super relaxing game so if you are stressed or just need to relax give it a chance

and it has amazing graphics

#####

merchant has arrived

#####

id like to like this game because i love the idea of peaceful farming on a picturesque planet while riding a mech

however manning the mech feels like its made of cheap plastic and why the heck is it afraid of water and the game lacks guidance while forcing the player into grinding from early on

the days are too short tending to the plants is just annoying because you have to water them every day and the days again are very short the default mech tools are too weak and theres no clue on how to get more advanced resources for upgrading

feeding the animals just makes no sense the companion robotic character seems like a claptrap ripoff from borderlands only in this case its not funny

although many of these aspects can and probably will be improved in time im not sure that the overall feel of controlling the mech can be fixed as it is the core part of gameplay and if the devs didnt do anything about it before the release

id be happy to be wrong though love the art style and the general idea time will show i guess

#####

insane cpu and gpu temperatures on this game only had to refund

#####

this game is very similar to doom eternal minus the demons the hellish landscape the gore the violence the sick rock soundtracks and todd howard

in lightyear frontier all those has been replaced by friendly extraterrestrial wild life gorgeous landscape happy little trees peace  tranquility chill acoustic guitar tunes and no todd howard

since its an unreal engine based game its quite an eye candy if your machine can handle it i have quite a beefy pc and funnily enough the max settings arent named ultra but frame breaking they werent lying well its still way above the 100fps in my case but i settled for the high settings to avoid suffering from third degree burns

if you dont have a beefy pc fear not theres plenty of settings to mess around with to be able to run it its not a 300go game like ark either its only 2go

only bad thing i have to say right now is that remapping keys seems to be broken the game clearly has a menu to change those but when you try to remap any key youll get stuck on the pick the new key screen and all you can do is altf4 im assuming they will sort this one out in the coming days hopefully

#####

just a quick shoutout to fellow deckers only played 30 mins or so and i turned settings down low in the graphics options it runs lovely on the steam deck and looks great  and controls are all great didnt have to change a thing hopes this helps any fellow deckers that are not sure as to how this runs also what i have played so far is great really enjoying it

#####

lightyear frontier has a vast amount of potential but in its current state i struggle to find reason to continue playing 

as of the time of this review i have 21 hours invested  ive fully upgraded my mech beat the game so far and purchased all mech cosmetics 
the game is indeed relaxing but also lacks any level of challenge it has the framework of a survival game and feels similar to subnautica but there is no way to losedie or even be remotely set back

this is at its very core a farm sim that has a lot of room for growth 
as this game is in early access at the time of this review the story is essentially nonexistent aside from a precursor esq civilization and a focus on restoring the polluted regions of the planet 

the game is enjoyable but i dont see myself investing further time into my farm after completing the mech tech tree and unlocking all regions 

there needs to be some sort of incentive to playing the game after the story has been completed 

referencing subnautica again or even the forestsons of the forest the gameplay loop allows for continual play outside of the storyline

i want to love this game and i genuinely enjoyed my time with it but it just seems to be lacking something 

i look forward to seeing how this game looks during its full release 

hopefully it fills that void of whatever its currently missing

worth playing but no continual value outside of the current 20 ish hour playtime

#####

graphics are great and theme is original

#####

very relaxing and addicting game 1010 more than worth the price

#####

titanfall meets valheimicarus

#####

you can kinda tell its erly accses but im super hopfull


#####

so far i have enjoyed the game its quite tedious at times but hey new game  its chill and you in a robot what more do you want

#####

they went for chill and relaxing they achieved it i recommend it to those who really seek chill games with zen like qualities for me though it was just boring i need more to do more building options and more expansive creative options i want to build massive things not just unlock stuff the storage was also an issue i like to go and just mass harvest for hours not and option here due to the way storage works so while they achieved the goal as stated for the target audience i am not the target for this game

#####

i enjoyed my first 20 minutes of gameplay until i realized that there were no survivor mechanics i knew from the beginning that the planet itself would be cozy with no danger from enemies etc and thats quite okay however having a farm on an abandoned planet and growing whatever without being forced to at least cook and feed yourself made the game loop unsatisfactory for me and no feeding the fauna is not quite the same

#####

kinda reminds me of slime rancher with the progression mechanic you need to visit new areas and collect resources thererestore the areas in order to unlock new blueprints its a fun chill game until the noxious bubbles start forming above your crops then its a panic induced heart attack as  you try to pop them all before they destroy your crops i played it solo seems like it would go pretty quick with a few friends feels pretty polished for being early access my only complaint is the mech feels a bit floaty right now its fast and i think they were trying to go for some sort of inertia mechanic but if you turn too quick from a sprint you just feel like youre on ice skates right now instead of feeling the proper weight of the mech move around

the drop rate for tree saplings is pretty low too i nearly cleared out the area i was in and had maybe 20ish saplings for the 100150 or so i felled

#####

satisfactory meets farming simulator pretty good so far looking forward to seeing how it develops

#####

by far the best early access game ive played me and a buddy of mine got this and we are loving it so far keep up the good work you have a player out of me

#####

you farm while riding a mech pretty awesome tons to explore

#####

super cozy game super fun to play with the hubby 3

#####

a fun mix of farming survival exploration and tractor mechs

#####

if you were ever playing titanfall and thought gee i wonder what it would be like to farm in one these this game is for you

#####

after watching a episode called suits for the show love death robots i just had the desire to play a game where i have a mech suit and a farm and i get to fight hordes of space bugs so far this game has fulfilled most of that wish and as much as id love to be given a kickass loadout of weaponry to defend my farm im fine to keep it a nice and cozy farming game not focused on fighting though if that were to change and there were some bugs to fight then id be the last to complain about that

#####

fun with friends and a very relaxing game

#####

absolutely phenomenal game this is the most stable and fun early access game ive played since subnautica first launched early access nearly 10 years ago

graphics are good gameplay loop is solid voice acting is good customization movement upgrades crafting etc are all wonderful
the only issue ive found so far is that its lacking in content and some of the inventory weights need some touchups but its early access so thats way better than most games in this state

#####

this game is an absolute joy to play i wasnt sure what to expect but its impossible to not smile when you play this game so far its amazing 

#####

pretty good game for the buck didnt encounter any major bugs or game breaking glitches but there were some the most annoying thing is that you cant mine some resouces in multiplayer sometimes but hopefully it will get fixed soon 
overall its just a chill little game no monsters no hunger or hp just gathering resources and exploring would recommend

#####

very chill and entertaining game 

#####

good


#####

came for robbit stayed for the puddle slurping gun

#####

ive only played one multiplayer session but it is one the most immersive and beautiful games ive ever played would highly recommend it for the exploration and farming aspects as well as it being a great game to unwind to it is not a boring game in any sense and there is a variety of quests that create an simple cozy experience

#####

ive played a lot of farming sims in my time but ive never tended to alien crops and gathered resources behind the windshield of a mech 
thanks to lightyear frontier im doing exactly that and from the getgo it proves to be one of the more novel and downright fun ways to farm 
with a handful of different tools that can be attached to my right arm i use a vacuum harvester to suck up all the fully grown plants in my plots of land 
then i switch it up to my trusty seed shooter  which as the name implies  lets me fire out seeds in the now vacant sections of soil 
coupled with an irrigation hose that acts as the mechs equivalent of a watering can a spike saw that can break down trees rocks and minerals and a sprout canon that can be used to plant saplings the tools and design of the mech make everything feel far less laborious 

the enjoyment of farming is also helped by the fact that frame breaks adventure sees you land and try to make a home for yourself on such an inviting peaceful planet with no combat or threatening presences
its the kind of place you want to get lost in with verdant fields vibrant trees and plants unusual wildlife and starry skies decorated with a few neighboring planets 
theres plenty to discover and do in this alien world which you can explore solo or with three friends quite comfortably 
the early access build already shows heaps of potential but it is in need of a little refinement 
some absent smaller features came to mind during my time in the mech that could make the experience more streamlined and with a touch more guidance ingame lightyear frontier would really shine 

after a bit of a rocky landing the beginning of lightyear frontier sees you put your mech back together by reattaching its arm and front engine with your pickaxe tool  which can levitate and move objects outside of your mech 
after flipping it upright you can then get inside and set out to collect your tools which have been scattered around the landscape 
each tool is marked by a yellow flare of smoke that can be seen from a distance and after a bit of scouting i had every tool available to me which can be swapped out from a dial wheel menu from this point on youll get a variety of tutorial objectives to complete from building a basic homestead which comes in the form of a tent to creating a plot of land to plant your first seeds 

while these initial objectives set up the basics quite well the guidance early on could be a little clearer 
it wasnt immediately obvious to me for quite some time for example that you have another tool you can switch to when youre outside of the mech that lets you paint objects 
for the most part its all quite straightforward to get to grips with but there were occasions when id have appreciated some more explanation 

there are multiple forms of progression in lightyear frontier that i really enjoyed 
the first ties to resources as you gather minerals and wood and grow new plants in the world by finding seeds youll unlock more blueprints for various constructs 
this will range from decorative items you can make to increase the coziness level of your homestead to different crafting stations that let you create new items that youll need to build more advanced blueprints 

your mech also has various upgrades available which youll need to work towards to get your hands on more resources in the world  not unlike stardew valley you have to improve your tools to break down stronger minerals or bigger trees 
i can see how lightyear frontier is trying to encourage discovery but i did run into some issues because the game doesnt tell you or provide hints as to what you need to do to unlock certain recipes or resources  i would often being able to see resources i needed before i was able to actually make them which did sometimes cause confusion  

the map itself is also broken up into different areas that need to be discovered and then restored by cleaning up noxious weeds or slime contaminating the ground 
this again ties to your mech upgrades since youll need to improve certain tools to get rid of stronger noxious substances 
the more you restore the more you have access to overall theres a satisfying sense of progression that feels rewarding and keeps me invested 
its always exciting to see the places ive restored thanks to the work i put into my mech upgrades and in turn unlocking more blueprints by discovering what resources new areas have 

the main sticking point i had early on in lightyear frontier is how quickly i got overencumbered 
especially when playing solo a lot of the upgrades constructs and decorations are going to require you to do a lot of resource gathering and the space your mech has is pretty limited to begin with 
thankfully you can build storage spaces to lighten the load and one of the mech upgrades will allow you to carry more but it takes some time to get 
this means that i was often running back and forth to deposit my bounty more than anything else to start off with 
on the plus side since youre in a mech you dont ever have to worry about stamina which is a common hindrance in farming adventures

when it comes to building in the world its happily a breeze to set down your homestead and the various crafting stations thanks to its snap system that automatically adjusts an objects position when its nearby something else 
the only downside is that there doesnt seem to be a way to alter or tweak the position of something once its placed down 
if i wanted to say move a decoration id have to recycle and rebuild it hopefully this is a feature that will come later down the line 

playing in coop certainly makes quick work of the earlier stages of the game since you can band together to collect resources to go towards constructs 
you each get a mech and have to gather your own tools but then you can work together to build up your homesteads 
while it works quite well and its easy enough to host a world for other players to join there isnt much currently in the way of inbuilt features for communication 

on the world map the markers are also very limited in general
youll only see the location of where youve built your homestead along with the option to place down one other single tag 
even when playing solo having more tags to place down on the map would make it so much easier to mark notable locations to come back to 
with so much resource gathering to do it would be handy to have additional markers you could leave on the map to remind you where you found a good batch of copper or coal for example

in spite of some features i would love to see ive really enjoyed my time with lightyear frontiers early access 
as a longtime fan of farming games the mech offers a novel refreshing approach to the farming sim genre 
the satisfying sense of progression and peaceful world also kept me coming back and my plan of doing just one more ingame day often turned into multiple as i got lost in my pursuit of advancing 
the early access launch has so much going for it already and im looking forward to seeing how lightyear frontier grows in the future


#####

relaxing game where giant mechs will run full force into walls and trip over stones animals trees and ledges every other minute 910

#####

100 would recommend its so cozy and cute and realxing

#####

fun

#####

i find lightyear frontier to be exactly what i was missing at the end of my day  kids are in bed house is quiet and its time to explore  the farming is fun and the animals are cute i find it utterly amusing when i overestimate my jumps and the mech falls over resulting in needing to exit it and flip it over  lastly exploring the vibrant world keeps me engaged while trying to learn more about the ruins

#####

its a fun casual game could use a bit of direction however its not hard to figure out if you check the upgrades and craftables also explore

#####

love the cozy feel a bit lacking in content but thats fully expected from an early release game and im excited to see how it grows great to play with a partner who isnt as big of a gamer

#####

a heartfelt experience with a lot of potential i genuinely cant wait for the full version to come out

#####

game has potential but needs a lot more work before its really worth it

if you watch the trailer then you have basically already played the game the game started to feel pretty small from about hour 1 and i feel like diminishing returns is setting in real fast about hour 4

there are a lot of cool elements that i could see becoming very interesting for example its really neat how the pickaxe doubles as sort of a halflife gravity gun but honestly about 90 of the game is played inside the mech so you hardly use the pickaxe plus the 10 you are not in your mech isnt all that fun i also dont like how slippery the mech feels when youre running around

also this game has no business selling a cosmetic dlc pack yet

#####

this game has some interesting mechanics like vacuuming up resources and throwing them at your mech shooting seeds into the soil with your gun and perhaps the stake driver tool that stabs at objects for collection

outside of those things theres not a lot going on here the world is very empty feeling and resources are far too scarce and spread too far away from each other the mech and pilot walking speed are a bit too slow for my liking i will keep an eye on this title but its going to take a lot to bring me back

#####

100 recommend the game its very relaxing and soothing to play and has a nice progression system there is no need to look up guides at all you just have to either explore the current area or make sure you have crafted every tool you have unlocked it is a very well thought out system that makes you go through everything you unlock

the days for me did feel a little short tho but that could just be me

#####

i had high hopes for this game mainly because i made assumptions about the gameplay based on the the theme i was expecting something similar to my time at portia with mechs and automation when in reality this game caters to very casual players looking for a cozy game

you have to go around feeding animals the more nests you feed the more resources are regenerated the following day and cleaning up toxic sludge and weeds it reminds me of a casual slime rancher or perhaps one of those simulation games where you clean up an area by removing the trash and repairing broken railing

i only played it for a little over an hour but that was enough time for me to get bored and to feel like i was doing chores i would encourage people to play the demo first

#####

game freezes every three seconds when it doesnt have internet access

#####

fun coozy game but feels like youre playing minecraft sandbox 
you have a field and some materials now go build until youre tired of it 
the game has potential but it definitely need some love in making it feel grindy driving and not like a open sandbox world

#####

in my 8 hours i completed most of the content i got softlocked in an story event area and cant leave very basic 11 upgrade system the farming and animal feeding feels like an afterthought the worst is that an npc constantly comments on almost everything you do maybe in a year or 2 this will be fleshed out but for now it is pretty barebones

#####

i dont review a bunch a games but this one is very fun and cozy highly recommend 

excited for future updates

#####

usually the 1st 13 hour of gameplay of a game show what the gameplay loop will be all about the game is too slow for me i really enjoyed satisfactory that had a faster pace and this game definitly gives some of satisfactory vibes but yeah the game isnt for me i can see people enjoying it for sure universe is relaxing nice artistic direction smooth gameplay there is issues of course like cutting the wood with a chainsaw is slower and give you less ressources than using a pickaxe for some reasons but its not that big of a deal it feels polish in many ways from what i understood i was waiting a arcadish experience with a normal pace progression in a mix of satisfactory and farming simulator but it is not the case the game should be more enjoyable mid game with the basics upgrades to your mecha but from what ive seen in upgrades menus it will take a lot of time to get the upgrades i would have needed from the start like a more fast mecha that is really slow at the start a lil more inventory space and few other things so yeah keep in mind before buying that it is a chill and really slow pace experience so personnally im getting a refund but i still recommand it if you like those really chill experiences

#####

support the devs buy this

the game is unique  and i feel more to come 

#####

good game fun relaxing but to a certain point there is a lot of work to do

#####

very relaxing game could do with a bit more instructions and game hints to locate materials and equipment

#####

i have been excited about this game after playing the demo that rce played i was not let down

this is a speedy farmercrafting game i have read here that as there is no risk there is no survival aspect and on that point i agree however to call the game too small and boring which it is not it reminds me of how euro truck 2 makes you feel is shallow the game is not very big as it is in early access which hopefully the developer follows and it is not boring it is gaming to listen to an audiobookpodcast to it is beautiful to look at pip3r is no way near as annoying as claptrap from borderlands but a little less is better it is not too deep yet but it was released into early access yesterday so people just need to be patient especially for 20 looking forward to seeing what is in store for this game

overall this game is very entertaining

#####

farming in giant mech suits what more can be said is super chill and laid back and the progression system in this game is easy to get ahold of 

because the game is in early access it is possible to get through all the content but id honestly just take the time to explore and roam around and build some insane looking farms

#####

absolutely love this little farming game love the mech love the animals you come into contact with all of the settings work really well without much having to fine tune literally the cutest game and super cozy its the perfect game for just wanting some chill time where you can walk around picking up resources or taking photos of the beautiful environment

finally played the multiplayer and that is super fun too looking forward to many more hours ahead as they continue to add to the game wonderful early access release so far

#####

pretty chill worth it

#####

this game is my happy place

#####

lightyear frontier is a nice and relaxing game with great visuals and quite satisfying gameplay i played it in multiplayer so cant really speak on the singleplayer experience but i found it to be relatively well balanced between time spent and reward for doing so which is important in games like this

there are some things that my friend and i talked about that would make the game a lot more fun though as it is now theres relatively limited amounts of upgrades to get and a lot of them is just a flat little number boost like more carry weight or more water storage they dont feel like they change your mech very much at all

it also seems strange that the watering mechanic arguably the thing that is the most handson experience of actual farming is so utterly dull to do the water tank on your mech even upgraded is abysmally small and walking back and forths to refill your storage is really annoying as soon as you get to the point of having a dozen or so 25 plot farms it also seems strange that theres no autowater function when that is one of the first upgrades you get but for your seed gun 

the way your mech interacts with its enviroment like falling over when on unstable terrain is a source of great entertainment as you trip over a large rock and faceplant directly in to deep water and respawn but some more mobility abilities would make it a lot more enjoyable the jet we currently have is fun but some grappling or climbing tools would really be appreciated

shoulder mounted tools would also be great autoturrets for doing work for example something to really spice up your mech and customize it after your playstyle beyond just visuals on the topic of visuals though i really have to commend the absolutely bonkers amounts of decoration items and upgrades for your mech we were not prepared for the massive amount of just junk we could use to decorate our homestead very impressive 

so all in all very enjoyable but could use some more meat on its bones

#####

mechchill 

cool game

#####

pretty fun game so far i think it needs a bit more content to justify purchasing and it definitely could use some more typical farming game features especially automation and foundations for largescale building
my one big gripe with the game is that theres no method for long range movement and some materials are specific to certain regions so either you are setting up multiple bases or you have to constantly go between areas regularly to gather materials since materials respawn by feeding animals that especially makes this more like a chore than an enjoyable experience please add some form of longerrange travel be it teleportationfast travel or perhaps a vehicle of some sort
also it would be really nice if we could go inside the latergame houses but its not entirely necessary
apart from that this game is wonderful very peaceful and cozy i will be watching this games development and plan to write a new review when more features are added 

#####

the planet doesnt have a complete ecosystem without predators it misses the mark slightly with what farming is about feels like what vegans think farming is when they claim to be saving the planet 

that being said its early in development i love the concept of farming in a mech so much i tried 3 times over the last 15 years to make a game of my own about it and i believe in the concept so much that i think it can be saved either by the developers as they update it or the community through mods 

i rather piper talk through beeps and boops shes annoying and i dont get annoyed that easy currently encumbered doesnt do much because there is no danger and there doesnt seem to be seasons or a deadline or a reason to sleep so there isnt any challenge which is why people find it boring who cares if something screws up my crops i literally have all the time in the world ill just replant

#####

obviously its early access and naturally missing a lot of features but at the moment i rate it as its okay and a bit lacking in a few of areas i only got a few hours in before getting tired of playing it so maybe some of these are less of an issue later on but

 the little robot chiming in on every activity you do quickly becomes annoying i thought itd mostly bring up little hints and tutorial bits and pieces but instead it tells me ive stepped on an animal for the 1000th time

 unlocking new areas is extremely time consuming and a slog you have to clear slime and weeds from each zone to unlock it and until you unlock it no resources generate in it the process of removing slime and weeds is just really boring and a huge chore weeds arent too bad as you can just vacuum them up but slime requires you to clear them with water so you spent a lot of time running to and from a pool of water to refill your tank

 at least in the early game i felt like i spent a lot of time just skipping days purely to get my crops to grow and to regenerate seeds so i could craft more items and plant more crops to upgrade my mech

 when i wanted a lot of a resource it was a chore to feed every nest in a zone to max out the resource generation or sleep three days in a row

 limited map controls you get one generic map marker i really wanted more customizable permanent markers so i could mark out where resources and animal nests were located without having to constantly remember where to run to ive wasted a lot of time trying to remember where resource nodes were especially if i hadnt been to harvest them in a while

 given that the mech is the selling point of the game im not sure what the benefit of the mech is exactly you get different tools to use but its not really any different from any other game there wouldnt really be any difference at all if you were just playing as a person with an assortment of tools the concept of piloting a mech to farm feels more like a gimmick than offering anything really unique and if anything actually ends up feeling rather clunky at times as you need to regularly exit it to sleep upgrade etc oh and it gets stuck on little rocks and falls over constantly meaning you need to get out and flip it

 and speaking of the mechpersonyou feel absolutely tiny when you get out of the mech like youre literally 1 foot tall you also get a pickaxe that can mine and grab items but ive yet to find out what the point of this is as ive yet to use either of these other than right at the start of the game when you assemble the mech as of yet there doesnt really seem to be a point in not being in the mech

its an interesting idea and i hope it gets better but its more of a meh rating from me at the moment ill check it out again in the future to see how it progresses

#####

a chill game enjoying it so far interested to see where this goes over time farmville meets alien planet sort of d

someone asked or said what is survival without the danger hello  i dont see where this is billed as a survival game its a farming game on an alien planet maybe survival aspects will come down the road but as it is its not a survival game its farming  with a back story

#####

im enjoying the game right now i might have an in depth review later but wanted to put my upvote since the game is what i expected from the demo

edit good god i hate that the satellite comments on everything please give an option to make her less chatty i love her during story dialogue moments but i dont need someone commenting on me picking up a rock

edit 2 current main story is about 7 hours im not the type that goes past the story to 100 things so this was all i cared to do i reckon if you shoot for all mech upgrades and achievements itd be 1020 hours long still even though im stopping my journey here and waiting for full release it was a pleasant experience i had some minor issues with the game but thats more oh this is a challenge and if games dont have challenges then theyd be boring

#####

excellent casual farming  crafting  exploring game

similar to satisfactory wmods and thankfully no fighting thats one thing i really hate in my farming sims and while this game has random events to keep things interesting i never feel rushed and very much enjoy exploring harvesting and restoring the different biomes of the map

it may be early access but i tried the demo bought the game and played it for 12 hours straight so imo it was worth the purchase already

eager to seeing what else gets added to the game as the devs continue to work on it

#####

dont buy the dlc the blueprint for the mailbox replaces the upgrade depot that means you will never build the merchant landing and never progress past the first hour of the game

#####

a very relaxed take on the survival genre 
jump in your farmech build your outer space homestead and enjoy the scenery 

#####

a game to chill and build things very pleasant to play while having a drink 810 would recommend

#####

farmech
farming mech
a mech that farms

#####

i love this game i cant stop playing it

#####

the only thing that will make this game better is if it worked on the steam deck solid foundation for a cozy farming sim

#####

love the graphics and multiplayer cross platform

#####

honestly surprised the amount of content they give you access to in the demo overall ive spend about 15hours in the demo and about an hour in standard play i must say for an early access game this is pretty flushed out nothing overly glitchy and plenty of qol adjustments im getting great frames at max settings everything looks beautiful outside not being able to move buildings and capture animals currently on the road map this is a solid and unique concept 

allinall i appreciate the devs detail even in alpha and the longevity of the demo to allow you to get a taste of the experience its not often i go out of my way to leave a review on something i look forward to seeing what kind of content they add down the road

#####

so far i love it great graphics fun so far

#####

this is a satisfying cozy game its beautiful no rushing no fighting just taking care of the planet and farmingcrafting if you are a cozy gamer i totally recommend

#####

interesting little story has good bones game seems chill but also looks gorgeous and runs very well worth is so far and cant wait to see where it goes in the future

#####

lightyear frontier is a really chill mech farming game focused on making it easy for new players to play
alot of the mechanics are easy to understand and the game isnt too grindy

i managed to fully complete the main story line in about 15hrs playing by myself
i reccomend that you play this with friends to get even more fun and enjoyment out of the game

there is a couple of visual bugs and the piper is a bit chatty imo but other than that it was worth its price

devs please add character customisation

#####

chill game cant wait for future content

#####

its just nice to play a game that works on launch and is so chill and stress free i love it

#####

#####

it is a very explorer friendly game you land on a planet and have to save regions from infection

the difficulty lies in the skill tree which locks you out of certain content until you farm enough to unlock it you get a companion which guides you and gives usefull information at times

unfortunately this game does not offer an extensive questline in fact none at all the only real mission is to spoiler unlock all regions and enter an alien base where you get the water travel perk to travel to the northernmost region where you get basically the same materials as in other regions which is not helpful since you have completed the game at that point yes you could farm all the skills but for what spoiler

they also have a region on the map that is inaccessible in the current version of the game sadly they can release a game on an early access excuse to not bring it to completion if you want your 1015h of fun which is the time i needed to complete it with someone its a good game but dont expect anything amazing story wise exploring isnt fun after the second or third region

exploration 710 pretty decent
replayable 210 why would you its just exactly the same again
story 410 only story is to unlock all regions and spoiler enter some alien thing spoiler
graphics 810 solid scenes to look at
base building 810 functional stuff to advance is good rest are all props to roleplay
mechanics 610 skill tree is good until you see that you dont need everything to finish the game

#####

it good

#####

fun and relaxing

#####

nobody is gonna see this so im just gonna say im gay

#####

i was on the fence on this game however since as of the time of writing this review the online coop wasnt working since that was the main selling point for me and my friends i  do not recommend this game in its current state and will be going for a refund since it lacks what it claimed coop

#####

love it

#####

loved this game so far  beautilful enviroments  love farming and the music hits 100

#####

please add
ambience volume slider the crickets omg
ability to rebind keys this is a must dont force us to use hardwired keybindsso tired of this

#####

think titanfall but instead of combat you farm and relax and have a pleasant time

#####

only played for 20 minutes and already encountered a game breaking bug i jumped out of my mech to build my first base and its not letting me get back inside the option doesnt show up 

kek

probably gonna refund

#####

ny det

#####

ok firstly this is early access so can change

have played this title for a little over 24 hours now and as steam keeps asking i will share my thoughtsas someone with varied gaming interests i have played quite a few of this genre
i have over 2000 in rust and ark each so am used to the farming aspect
i found the controls quite intuitive with control being smooth
the world quite stunning with some interesting life
so far it has been a fun and engaging experience
it does lack a little polish though and so things can get stuck you included
you get the occasional locked view on entering it too
but get out then back in and it is all good
things i wish we had
fast travel omg fast travel it is not a huge map but it can be a lot of walking initially
i totally understand why it is not there
but im lazy so would like a compromise
not pop wherever you like
just enable a buildable transmitter that will only deliver you to base so getting back after farming is quicker
not the journey out 
all in all i have played full release titles with more bugs
had less fun doing it too for twice the money
all things considered the test of and action is would you repeat it
yes
with this yes i would
its a great little game that i look forward to seeing completed
and i happily recommend it to anyone who has realistic expectations
however if you lack patience it may not be for all
have a great day and thanks for reading

sucking squirting and mechs 1010

#####

ok

#####

great game would recommend it and would love to see it on the switch please the best

#####

at this time i have about 7 hours in this game i got it on the day it came out so far its very fun seems like i have many more hours of gameplay and a nice chill game too play with friends i recommend

#####

overencumbering and tedious not relaxing

spent 5 minutes having to collect tablespoons of water to clean up toxic sludge 

went to last spot to collect a starter tool and got stuck fell off a small cliff and was not able to reset

might be better when mech movement speed and resource collection are improved



#####

they have ratscallionsratscallionsi literally paused my game to write this reivew buy this masterpiece of a game

#####

наконецто farming simulator 3024

#####

found this literally out of nowhere and fell in love with it maximum cosiness just sitting in my mech in the rain

#####

here is my early review of lightyear frontier httpsyoutubeyspwxrk1eri

i also have a lets play and beginners guide if you want to see more gameplay to make your decision on whether to get the game 

#####

titanfarm thoroughly enjoyable and a great way to wind down after a long day

#####

интересная и увлекательная игрушка очень спокойная требующего огромного терпения рекомендую играть в эту игру

#####

i am digging pun intended this game  not overcomplicated and fun to explore  hope they keep adding on to it

#####

great little chill farming game

#####

this game is amazing i really love it and have a rapidly growing appreciation for it theyve thought outside the box as my friend said it is literally titanfall 2 before the imc think of it as a prototype used by civilians before military instead of the other way around used for farming landed on another planet to feed humanity its a solid game its got a few bugs sure but none that are game breaking and with friends this game becomes 10x better as with any game

#####

play this game

#####

this game is such an amazing way to pass time like a combination of animal crossing minecraft and stardew valley 1010 recommend cant wait to see if they release any dlc

#####



#####

so far its been great playing with friends ran into a few annoyances on day one but the devs seem to be listening and fixing those bugs  gameplay issues

#####

familyfriendly farming game about an individual trying to do his part in fixing the world would be considered one of the more relaxing and fresh takes on an actual farmingexploration game very very chill like damn i was surprised tbh

#####

ive fallen and i cant get up

#####

having fun so far 

#####

not a bad game just not what i was wanting yet wait for more content or an expansion very good foundation for the future


#####

not that much fun tbh   clear areas collect resources unlock decorations  no instructions on how to do things like build roads which dont seem to do anything btw  or complete missions for your neighbour might be a worthwhile game one day but atm its a grind and with too much walking

#####

yes

#####

awesome this is very cool fun so far and the cool is so great

#####

cool game

#####

1010 would spraywater in my friends mech face again

#####

69 hours in and the gameplay loop so far is as follows
build basics according to tutorial clean area to unlock resources feed wild animals to make resources respawn more efficiently to speed up progression get upgrades clean new area rinse and repeat very chill because there isnt much to do its pretty but the demo pretty much summed up the entirety of the game so far 410  farm game with an annoying ai helper which just gives you lackluster positive reinforcement for minor inconsequential successes

#####

mediocre at best

#####

because of a game breaking bug that renders plots unusable if plots are removed the mounds stay and cannot be interacted with and you cannot build another structure in its place i simply cannot recommend this game all my 20 hours gone to waste and i have no motivation to start over this kind of bug in a farming game is unacceptable

on second thought  i did start over and i gotta say that i cannot stop playing you know that meme f you and ill see you tomorrow  yeah thats what happened here

its a fantastic game with the current content so much stuff to do and explore

#####

just crashed and it wasnt great when it was running after reading the eula stay away until all of that legal and keybinding and length of game play is fixed

#####

lovely game

#####

gud

#####

the game is too small there is barely any game to play i would recommend waiting for the actual release

#####

titanfall but farming

#####

i dont think its ready to play yet moving around doesnt work youll be walking forward and then the forward movement will stop the view just wobbles side to side but you dont actually move anywhere if this ever starts working ill have another go as the rest of it looks quite nice

#####

the key mapping is in game and working so far review updated
thanks for the quick response
the game is playable for now

#####

best game cool but bot nead more invertory capacity more like 300350
days gone so fast from 40 days
in all game so asome recomendet to play with friends and relax

#####

game feels warm it has a good color palette as well as relaxing music it runs well and gameplay is interesting and id normally put hours in to startbut

i dont get the trend of having an annoying buddy narrating to you constantly its invasive breaks the moments and nothing i wanna hear for hours on end  for example she makes quips if you run into something or when you wake up on a new day or just randomly talks honestly takes the game albeit early impression score from and 8 to a 4 for me 

there is an option to lower the voice volume theres subtitles but considering she seems to be your link to the storyline that does make it easier to miss important dialogue

#####

for a cozy game i have unlocked 4 storages and all are 60 weight limit i heard someone else say they had 6 and still 60weight limit the game needs a warehouse or dedicated storage like ark where a box holds one item but unlimited storage is super tedious atm and yes u do have crafting out of near by storage if game wants to play special snowflake with storage at least give us dump all items to storage or something any of these 3 features would pro fix most of this problem

#####

game looks really fun excited to try it again after its had some time to bake  one wishlist item is if the mech can be something other than combustionpowered  seems kind of weird to try to find a new home and immediately start emitting pollution  carbon

another one is to be able to avoid using the mech altogether

but honestly they nailed the aesthetic and it is absolutely gorgeous  really looking forward to it

#####

dont buy it unless ur pc is really good me and my girlfriend tried to play but everytime it would crash and they would have to reset their pc

#####

ones trash is you know the line

#####

b 35b good but should be improved

 chill farmingexploration game dont expect more than that
 decently optimized even ran on my worst laptop with about 56 fps
 you can decorate everything you can also remove the ugly nature decoration called trees everywhere 

 no noticable innovative designs or behaviors as far as i could find
 controls are nonresponsiveclunky when controlling the mech but fine when controlling the human controls are fine again when using a gamepad for both weird
 developers appear confused on what the bug actually is declare it fixed too early then have to roll out multiple patches to address the bug they declared fixed in the first patch

 somewhat annoying minigame weather events that are just point at the sky and hold vacuum  point at sphere and spray water not sure what these were supposed to be
 absolutely no automation at all so you will end up doing tedious tasks repeatedly despite the civilization having mastered intergalactic travel theyve never invented sprinklers
 watering fields is inconsistent  based on a micropixel adjustment youll either water a 5x5 or a 5x5 but one of the corners is missing this gets even worse with the higher upgrade
 100 achievement completion requires another player in a game where multiplayer is barely functional

h1detailh1
ive seen and played better farming games but its not to say that this game doesnt have some moments where it does shine unfortunately these are rather rare with the majority of the game being a mundane time waster  which isnt a bad thing just wish there was more overall it seems more like an early demo of a vision of a game where the developers themselves arent sure where to take it yet

theyve got multiple concepts they could take further drastically improving how interesting the game is the farming aspect so far is the most fleshed out but compared to other farming games of similar style is just barely scratching the surface the explorationstory aspect is almost nonexistent as if it was added just to have it and the animal part is so surface level that i ignored it for the entire 2nd save and didnt notice any difference  never ran out of materials

i hope the developers explore their concepts further and expand the game some ideas
 agriculture sprinklers its weird that a civilization that has mastered interstellar travel doesnt know how to make one considering that theyd be way more effective that a big ball of water washing away the soil
 agriculture crop mixing mix crop seeds to make new crops in addition to exploration
 agriculture fishing i dont need to comment on this how dare you not have a fishing minigame 
 agriculture animals right now theyre only used to have a faster refill on regrowing materials so why not make them also drop animalspecific resources or even being able to catch the animals and raise them on the farm
 exploration puzzles while there is one puzzle its only used to lock away travel to a clearly unfinished area considering the mechs ability jumping puzzles hidden cavespaths etc would all be an option

#####

the gameplay makes no sense the game is very long and boring

#####


i will leave the cat here so that everybody who passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards

my fav game rn it looks soo good and its mad cutee


#####

needs a bit more information as to what you are actually supposed to do and give a explanation as to the actual objective  incentive of the gameplay i wondered around aimlessly not knowing what i was doing this is supposed to be relaxing i found it frustrating

#####

i thought i was buying an early access not an alpha so many bugs unplayable in this state

#####

h3very short game lack of contenth3
i unlocked everything every upgrade artifact building achievement  everything for this genre and price i expected a bit more meaningful game time
hrhr
bprosb
the game is chill relaxing and pretty i love running around exploring building stuff organizing thats what you can do here

bconsb
list
    lack of meaningful content
    your mech often tips over and you need to get out and flip it its not fun just get rid of it anything that is designed to purposely waste my time is a huge putoff
    you are forever overencumbered
    strikeno keybinding optionstrike
    i had 16 oil pressers and having to click them all then click the oils 96 times every 15 minutes is tedious
    storage access radius is tiny doesnt encompass my entire farm
    stupid critters running around my base getting in the way and i am not able to shoo them away forever they keep coming back
    strikethe npc wont shut the f up fix speech volume  0strike
    maximum size water sphere is bugged not watering mounds
    nothing to spend money on besides seeds and cosmetics
    mechs hard to steer its all floaty and not fun to control
    feeding animals feels meaningless because all resources respawn on their own
    you need to run across the entire map to get fractulite then walk back home overencumbered not being able to sprint is so much fun glad its in game
    no incentive to play the game after there is nothing left to accomplish or unlock
list

i know its early access but that doesnt give a free positive review pass

#####

nah ill keep an eye on it for the future game feels empty atm

#####

boring

#####

super boring overall objective of the game is to clear out zones of some weird weeds and goo no sense of danger no survival aspect no other quests ect either walk around gathering resources or sit around waiting for your farms to finish thats it just to upgrade your mech tools to get to a higher tier resource area and repeat the process

#####

did you feel the pain to collect resources well i did

graphics are good game play is okay there is story line also


update can i get refund

not even started and game bug out and stop working

#####

a boring game

#####

so i like but 4 max players for me is just not enough  
game need time to grow up  add content  make dedicated servers for like 20 players  let them create the game 
we need more co op  and   some challenges 

i like to game is relaxing 

#####

annoying narrator i played a lot of games but this annoying voice no
 too peaceful 
 boring and slow 
 controlling mech is clunky 
 graphic is nice they needs to optimise it 
looks like asset flipper no amount of work and love can help this game to be better but maybe its not for me  


#####

just trash

#####

fun

#####

very relexing farming game with a little bit of exploring and some simple jumpnrun puzzels as of time of writing there is about 20 hours of content i hand a lot of fun with lightyear frontier thus far

#####

love it i just hope we discover the ancients

#####

a great game that is relaxing and fun with no shoot em scenarios but it keeps you engaged to gain status and learn new skills and capabilities  fully engaging

#####

game is amazing but there are some things that i would like to point out that i think might help the game  and also to address some bugs
 
firstly  let me give you a brief review on the game

 lightyear frontier is an open world exploration adventure game revolving around the player controlling a big mech the game is similar to subnautica  in the way that  the player you have to explore a forgotten alien planet  restoring land and finding new and exciting stuff and lore about a society that laid there years before you arrived kind of like the architects from subnautica and subnautica bellow zero 
the game also strikes similarities to slimerancher  for its art style and game mechanics of farming and having some sort of vacuum for picking things up

from these 2 comparisons i do not want this to seem like i am calling the game a copy cat i am actually praising the game devs for taking inspiration from these games and actually composing similar stuff to some of the best parts of those games lightyear frontier imo is actually one of the best adventure casual and story driven open world games out on the market  coming close to those previous tittles i mentioned  even for a newly released and early access game that still has a long way to go until it would be finished

the game is amazing because of its visuals story the feel of the game in which i want to add the rain
what i mean by the rain is that in most games  rain is an element made out of particles that dont feel like they have collision  in this game because you spend most of your time inside a mech  the devs animated the rain hitting the glass of the mech perfectly  i want to say that when i first experienced a rainy weather in this game  i got captivated by the movement of the rain drops and the sound of them hitting the top of my metallic and glass mech it made me feel like i next to a window on a rainy day with my window open  actually smelling that fresh aroma of rainy air
the building mechanic is really great  even the customizations in this great game are amazing  letting me choose my part in whatever way i want the color customization is phenomenal and also fun to use
also at first i didnt think that build a farm with lots of pointless details around it would be fun  but this game changed my perspective on that  and i can surely say that i love my farm  and the building opportunities  that this beautiful game offers

stuff i would want to see added  improved
i know the game just came out  but i would want to make some suggestions
from upannervalley on reddit add more periodic auto saves 
from upannervalley on reddit have more coal in every biome
make different map markers  so that we would be able to tag important stuff on the map with some different icons take inspiration from genshin impacts map and map markers
more mech upgrades 
give the mech a slightly less chance to tumble over
a way to cook stuff for a possible hunger bar  or just for aesthetics
make an upgrade point in the mech upgrades thing  that gives storages a wider area in which items can be used from inside them 
make the inventory upgrades more significant 
make a way for the mech to get damaged over time  and for the player to be able to restore it also what if it could blow up in 5 or so pieces and yo had to repair the damaged parts
work more on the mech pathfinding to hoe the ground 
make different tools for the player without the mech that take on a different role than those on the mech
make separate inventories for the player in and outside the mech suit

and now for some bugs i found
when using a composter  after a few days of filling it daily  the composter will get stuck and stop working  causing the game to think that there are greens inside the composter for it to destroy and it gets stuck  stopping the animation with the small green clouds around it and the flies the game will think that the composter is full and will not let you destroy it
spoilerafter getting the walking on water powerup sometimes  when you approach a body of water while pressing shift  the game will not put me in walking on water mode and will just let me enter the water normally and drown
when trying to paint the upgrade depot it completely ignores the action  remaining the same color while also taking away one of my paint buckets that i used on it

hope this review and request was helpful  im excited to see what the devs will bring to the future of this game i really see and think that this  game will be the next big hit in the gaming industry 

conclusion is that i think every person should give this game a try and i believe that most people are gonna fall in love with this game 

rating for the games current state 810

i await feedback and if you guys have any more requests for this game put them in the comments bellow
have a great rest of the year 3

#####

peaceful and fulfilling even at this date completing everything catches you off guard and its an amazing experience for those loved ones you want to make a memory with

#####

good game for relaxing

#####

great potential very buggy of course it is early access lol but i have one big bug to say something about the pathing is bugged twice i have spent about two hours making nice and even paths in multiplayer only for my friends to say they dont see anything we save many times during our sessions we load back in the next dayreload the game to play and my paths are gone other than the eventual bugs that pop up in early access games this game has a lot going for it i cannot wait to see the future updates maybe interior decorating for the different dwelling types snap mode for pathing for easy straight paths and more path options suit options just a ton of quality of life things which i am sure the team has talked about before haha

#####

this game is supper satisfying

#####

very family friendly and just relaxing game to play  you can hop on tend to a few things and move along as needed

#####

this game is one of the most beautiful and peaceful games i have played in quite some time though occasionally it felt a little grindy it made up for it by not feeling pressure or stress from not having enemies

the mechs give this game a really fun and new way to farm i love the customisation ability for them and making your mech unique

i would 100 recommend palying with a friend or a group getting to share the visually stunning places with someone else adds to the experience plus an extra set of hands is always a bonus

keen to see what comes in future updates and developments

#####

chill af love it

#####

mech walking simulator with occasional farming and hidden item side quests

#####

very relaxing and satisfying game

#####

good cousy and relaxing farm sim  survival game

#####

i really do enjoy the game but since its early access still there is some jank to it at the moment days are far too short so there is a significant time crunch i tend to feel if im growing a lot of crops at one time but otherwise with no consequences to not sleeping its pretty easy going i do wish the mech was a bit faster its almost agonizingly slow to get anywhere but upgrades do help with that other than building your farm and grinding materials there isnt much to do at the moment but the game is pretty gorgeous and fun if you like the more laid back kind of gaming im interested to see where this goes

#####

honestly been having a lot of fun with lightyear frontier  i refuse to give this game less than 5 stars

puts a lot of amazing elements into one game making it the ultimate base for the perfect game


#####

a nice chill craftingfarming sim without raids or combat or any of that junk just go at your own pace and explore the world

#####

love this game i have completed it i wasnt really rushing end game or anything but 13 hours is about it for game time right now you can obviously spend a lot of time customizing your homestead and mech but the customization options are a little bit lacking right now

i hope the devs add some automation features in future updates maybe little drones we can build to automatically water and plant seeds more stuff to do outside the immediate farm would be nice too i know ranching is in the near future so thatll be a cool plus

ultimately i think theyre heavily inspired by satisfactory so im really hoping for them to push into that direction with automation more vehicles specialized diving mech perhaps and bigger goals than just clean up the nearby environment

satisfactory x lightyear frontier crossover is what we all need

#####

this shotgun marriage between titanfall and slime rancher answers some very important questions that have plagued humanity for centuries

 what if we could use a smart pistol to plant crops
 what if bt had an accent that made you think he can make hella grits
 would a titan wear a tractors grill as a loincloth

and so so much more

in all honesty a very cute very lovely and very chill farming game its early access so its about 2030 hours of gameplay at the moment if youre someone who wants to collect and finish things i only played it single player it might be even less with friends pushing progression as well i will be keeping an eye on this one for future content updates for sure

#####

very much a game to recommend ive been enjoying calm hours in this game its very atmospheric and if you enjoy this kind of game slime rancher but remove slimes and add a mech i do recommend picking this one up also writing this review and thinking about what makes games viable ive noticed that i have not had a single crash in 10 hours of playtime which frankly is amazing for todays standarts 910 100 1010 when more content gets added

#####

1010  has garden gnomies

#####

brilliant little game 
i cannot wait to see what else the developer will patch into the game for an early access game it is very robust and did not glitch on me once 
i would love to see the mech get visibly stronger with upgrades etc but that is just a small point the game loop is fun and the crafting is very logical would absolutely recommend the game in its current state

#####

cozy farm vibes in a mech 1010

#####

been playing with a friend and its gorgeous chill simple and very enjoyable whether farming building or cleaning up the regions all of it is fun

#####

if you enjoy cute and cozy games with a  stress and carefree relaxing nature a game that has simple and relaxing resource gathering and farming a game with some simple puzzles to unlock parts of the map and the background lore then i recommend you give this game a try

my husband and i play it together for some fun relaxing us time and we have thoroughly enjoyed playing it so far 

i will say however that i do wish the farming element was a bit more complex by some means since its such a large part of the game but the game is also in early access so that may change as new updates come additionally i do find the mech to be a bit cumbersome especially when trying to traverse difficult terrain but right now those are my only real suggestionscomplaints

#####

this game was very fun and i cannot wait for more content 

pros
crafting pulls from chests nearby
various types of storage
farming system that is fun and intuitive
mech customization
good pacing

things that could use some improvement
some of the stuff is quite repetitive as far as unlocking zones but each zone is unique enough in design that it is not too bad
mech customization is cosmetic only i wish there were certain buffs or stats with specific designs
no way to mulch plants into seeds
no detailed build customization for housing or buildings they are premade blue prints

overall
this is a fantastic game well worth the money tbh the cons are so minimal for me that there wasnt really anything i really disliked about the game overall i just wish there was more content already so please keep it up

#####

the perfect chill game

#####

there have been some users who have only played this game for 3ish hours or less and gave this game a poor review i hope that mine can help others to understand how wonderful and cute this game is an example gripe someone wrote about is the mech being afraid of water although early on i can understand this frustration without giving detail like many other upgrade as you play games there is a way to get around that later on 

the ui is very smooth and the inventory system at first is a hassle until the recent patch allowing for easier storage and carrying capacity building and upgrading your farm and your mech has been a lot of fun for both my wife and i she likes to paint hers different colors every so often while i run off and collect resources she feeds the animals and i slave away at crops but the best part about this is that it doesnt feel like a chore the music is relaxing and with the days that rain my plants are watered for me

lastly one of the funniest things i have experienced in this game so far is the toddleresque motion of the mech when it trips on something i can jump and fly out of nowhere as if im a wwe wrestler about to land on my opponent my wife who is just simply trying to craft noxious spores and watch as my mech rolls all over the place afterwards get out of the mech and simply flip it back over to do it all again will i for sure i will and happily too get this game play with your homies or your significant other you wont regret it

#####

good 

the core mechanics are pretty much there just needs a little more honing in some areas 
 better optimization 
 sometimes the crafting system got me stuck there were a few times when my whole progression was halted because the game never told me that a specific item needed to be crafted in order to unlock new recipes 
 the control panel being functional and not just a static texture would help make the mech way more immersive 
 you absolutely need to be able to go inside your housetent if one major change had to be made it has to be this one 



#####

very fun

#####

its alot of fun enjoyable relaxing play style really like the soundtrack
