the first portal had genius original gameplay mechanics great story great level progression great voice acting great characters great engine and such a nice british humour it originated a ton of memes
if you didnt play finish and love portal 1 you are a bad person

this sequel brings all those qualities to a new level _the story is deep_ lots of wow moments graphics is beautiful much more levels environments and elements to solve the puzzles the coop multiplayer is so fun its epic
in my heart and in my mind i have no doubt _this is the best game ever made_
if you didnt play finish and love portal 2 you understand nothing about videogames

my son is on the asd spectrum and ever since he began playing this game it has truly opened his mind to thinking creatively whenever he is trying to solve a problem  thank you valve for helping my little boy

#####

h1 congratulations the simple fact that youre standing here listening to me means youve made a glorious contribution to scienceh1

portal 2 is the one of the greatest games ive played and this is actually coming from a person who doesnt even like platformers and puzzle games portal 2 is equivalent to bt2 judgement dayb when it comes to rating sequels ive refused to play it for a long time and finally decided to try this after listening to my friend and i regret not playing this masterpiece any sooner

h1prosh1
the developers picked up the best parts original and expanded upon it in every way imaginable both in gameplay and plot 
well written and memorable story and dialogues pacing is also well done 
best voice acting in a puzzle game i seriously cant think of any game topping this 
bstephen merchantb and bjk simmonsb did an absolutely terrific job bellen mclainsb performance as glados is so good that youll love to hate her character so then its a success i guess d
portal 2 has a humor like no other game its funny its dark but most importantly its original
gameplay is fun addictive and educational no matter how complicated the puzzles get the solutions are always sensible difficulty is much balanced and forgiving compared to the original portal which was a lot frustrating at times 
performance is flawless it was so smooth like as if valve built source just to make this game 
excellent soundtrack and musical score by bmike moraskyb and bthe nationalb 
two player coop campaign is equally fun as single player mode very welldesigned levels and actually requires cooperation and trust of your friend 
user created levels and mods are very impressive shout out to everyone who used the level editor to create amazing custom levels it was fun playing check them out once youre done with the main story 
nice and clean graphics aged very well even though its almost a decade old game visually this perhaps the bestlooking game from valve imo 
suitable for all ages no matter whether youre young or old portal 2 can be enjoyed by anyone who is familiar with playing video games with mouse and keyboard theres also a ps3 port available with ps move support
credit to valve for providing soundtrack for free
excellent port also supports linux and mac so no one is really missed 
steam cloud saving achievements steam trading cards official mod support 
one of the greatest video game endings so many great and ambitious and big budget aaa games have fulfilling gameplay story and quests but when it comes to endings a lot of them are either disappointing or dont meet the level of expectations the credits start rolling in not portal 2 it manages to be fun from start to finish line 

h1consh1

first part of the story can be a little predictable if youve watched a lot of movies and tv
most assets seem like theyre copied straight from previous valves works like the first portal half life 2 and its standalone episodes 
honestly ive tried hard to find and couldnt at this point im just nitpicking valve  

h1the bottom lineh1
portal 2 makes the original game feel like an experimental prototype you might think it is overrated but theres only one way to find out just get the game and first thing play the game already portal 2 is one of the funniest best written game of all time stephen merchant as wheatley and jk simmons as cave johnson perfect casting valve never disappoints or at least never did a decade ago or so portal 2 made me like puzzle and platforming games and im thankful for that

the developers borrow some concepts from 2005 indie game narbacular drop valve was so impressed that they hired the guys behind it and asked them to make portal you can check that game out for free by visiting their website just search the name on google or any other search engine that you prefer 

highly recommend it tobeveryoneb if youve read so far then youre probably interested in the game so wont hurt giving it a try

i have no idea why i waited so long to review this game here goes nothing and i hope you rate this up if you already know a thing or two or hate reading visit my pros and cons section as it helped many customers decide if this game is right for them

bintrob
you know how when you are on vacation and say i am so glad it isnt winter right now yeah that sums up the power this game has on you when you play the game it is socrisp vacationlike and when you have to leave it is like that miserable winter i was talking about

bsummaryb
this game as you should know from some other reviews and through the fact that it is one of the best selling games of all time leaves an effect on the player it is a beautiful storyline you play as a female test subject through the campaign she i wont spoil her name is forced through many tests glados a powerful robot who took over aperture has prepared for her you learn a lot about this character as you portal around puzzles of rooms and a lot is learned about yourself the programmedtobe idiot whom you will find out through the game is something to look out for as you think he is helping you escape it is a clever twist you will learn that the industry you are escaping from used to be a shower curtainpart factory yeah it will all make sense when you play 

bmultiplayerb
then there is the multiplayer mode with atlas and pbody who are trying to free the humans or whatever that itself with a partner is totally worth a lot of friday nights now that they are implementing itemsloadouts into the game or hatstauntsclothesflags to those who are uncertain of the term the game will be more interesting now i may not have many hours but i assure you that i have beaten multiplayer in about 4 hours and the single player in 3 i mean the rest of my hours come from exploring morecommunity maps and that is the amazing thing about this gameno matter how many times you have beaten it it is still fun also playing multiplayer with a different friend every time makes you find a lot out about their creativityteamworkleadershipmental abilities

bother important thingsb
the many achievements with variety are also something to look on about there are many things you will never notice no matter how many times you play unless you youtube some of it the deeper you dig into the storyline the more interesting you find the game there were many rumors that we are still uncertain of which makes this excellent

to dumb it down

ubprosbu
amazing graphics for a nonstop beautiful gameplay 
wonderful audio and music for a great experience 
welldesigned maps and challenges 
unlimited maps usercreated 
fantastic storyline 
many users own this game lol i remember the commercials 
holiday sales make buying this game super affordable
gender neutral
ubhelps with cognitive brain activitybu

ubconsbu
limited storyline i wish there was more to it but there is always portal 1 
some levels take seconds while others take many minutes not really progressive difficulty wise in my opinion which isnt a bad thing here spoilerto mespoiler
limited campaign exploration some repetitive looking levels here and there 
restricted to the short story line however there are some mods which are amazing but if you want more you have to manually download them instead of them being included with the game

bmy opinionated reviewb
i would say the cons are so minor that i shouldnt even have mentioned them because it may not make you buy the game do not let that happen get this game i recommend buying during a sale to get portal 1 and 2 for a cheap price together for the full experience because they raised the price of this game recently this is a classic game and will go down in history as one of the best  revolutionizing the way we thinkgame it was such an amazing thought that i hope you guys consider for yourselves

bratingb
out of 100 there is nothing wrong with this game you may not like it if you arent creative dont have friends to play it with or cant appreciate an amazing portal transportation concept but listen you will fall in love with this game and stack hours to it there is no community to worry about other than wonderfully made maps from users like you definitely get this game if you dont have it  that being said my review shouldnt even matter i would give this a spoiler97100spoiler after all of that i hope you read everything before looking at my rating

bfinallyb
thanks so much for reading so i hope you share the love and rate this review up as it took some thought to make if you are still wondering whether you should get the game or notwell it always will be a musthave and yes get it

this is one of my impulse buying on summer sale and i love it it was dirt cheap considering how well polished this game is
this game makes me somewhat feels stupid and smart at the same time

ps
if you cant solve one of the puzzle here is the todo list 
1 check your surrounding carefully
2 find the exit first and try to backtrace the route
3 always think physics with portal more importantly momentum this is the most used physics in this game

#####

in the winter of 2012 i was out in the cold for pe in year 9 of school it was miserable and to this day theres never been a single time where id rather be somewhere else more than that the lesson came to an end and i was nearfrozen i got into my mums car broom broom and she asked me how my day was i was so cold that i could barely form words i was driven home quickly and placed under a heated blanket with one of my favourite bagels

at that time i had been working through portal and was currently in the second act
humans forget things thats natural but i know deep in my heart that i am never going to forget the feeling of playing one of my favourite games on a ps3 nestled under a blanket and chomping on a soft bagel

life has its moments and ive cherished the game ever since

#####

very good game can u make a portal 3 


#####

in my playtime i felt proud for not looking the answers online and it gave me a sense of accomplishment without giving me a brain damage

portal 2 definitely live up to what people say about it the game is overwhelming and have the right to be considered b one of the best puzzle games b created to date it is really a must play for pc gaming even if you are not into puzzle games like myself i will talk about the most striking things for me during my playtime and some thoughts about it

list

   u b storyline b u  the story has improved a lot since the first game there is now a more noticeable narrative between the old villain glados a new character whitley and the playable character chell there is also a lot from the origin of the aperture science making it an interesting and solid game to go through
   u b challenging and mechanics b u  the game has a base mechanic the portal gun a weapon that shoot 2 different portals that you can go through it might be simple but the game keeps giving you new things to work with along the chapters making it a lot more challenging as you go further in the game
   u b comedy b u  this game is hilarious not only from the well written jokes spoken by  the characters but the environment has some hidden details that are so funny as well i would definitely recommend you to read the plaques and frames around the map
   u b aged like wine b u  portal 2 was released in april of 2011 back then it was revolutionary it was a brand new game with new features and mechanics today it is not much different the graphics is fairly decent and the game still unique the best thing is that portal 2 is a lot cheaper than it once was
   u b coop b u  as atlas and pbody you can play this mode with one more friend and enjoy a variety of more levels now with 4 different portals to work with which makes the levels much more complex the coop mode not only uses the already introduced mechanics very well but it also gives a little touch to the main story

list

when i think about it makes me really impressed that this game was released more than 9 years ago and it still a b unique b and b original b puzzle game portal 2 is a muchimproved version from portal 1 a game that was already great but this one is a refined version and brought the potential it had and i must praise the b voice acting b one of the best features and contribute a lot for it being so iconic

is understandable why people are always memeing and asking for valve to make more games of every franchise they have the quality of their games is top notch maybe their secret is that they took a long time to develop from the idea to the playability we just have to keep waiting

u b rate 92100 b u

#####

apparently i havent written a review for this game so i guess i will now

for starters this game is the reason i got a steam account in the first place my brothers friend came over with the 360 disc and i stayed up all night playing then of course he took the game when he left i immediately wanted to continue playing  i was hooked from that point forward played through the entirety of it on some awful computer and getting 20 fps average it was worth every second of it honestly 

the campaign is of course one of the standout singleplayer modes of gaming the difficulty curve is welldone the humor is always wellexecuted and theres tons of places to listen to additional dialogue if you feel like waiting to see what happens
then of course the coop is a solid continuation of said singleplayer but continues the curve with the addition of a second set of portals and of course another person to cooperate with i have tons of good memories with friends and randoms alike especially the moments where you have to decide if you really want to solve right then and there or if you want to move the bridge your partners relying on
and to top it all off theres a leaderboard system that allows you to go for least timeportals with your friends to this day i occasionally check on my scores to make sure nobodys beaten them and its always a pleasant surprise when someone has

all in all the games simply amazing if the fact that its the #1 rated game on steam with 121015 positive reviews to 1586 negative doesnt indicate its sheer quality i dont know what will its a great game that came from a time when valve still made them and it will forever hold a special place in my heart

need portal 3

#####

portal 2 is a masterpiece a work of art that you will love for its ingenious story popculture references to logical puzzles and coop multiplayer

#####

portal 2 is not just a videogame but a lesson in game design

the game picks up the somewhat lost tradition of groundbreaking games developed by valve walking in the footsteps of milestones such as half life 2 and to this day remains one of the absolute best games i ever had the pleasure to experience

portal 2 should be played and revered by every person considering a career in game design as it represents a superbly balanced mix of all the components that make a gaming experience great

exploration humour setpieces narration atmosphere difficulty all these aspects are balanced with a care and love that only legendary developers such as valve have as a results we get a game that never gets dull repeats itself or stumbles the player with overly difficult puzzles which are still available in the many additional bonus maps

one of the finest pieces of digital entertainment ever conceived and one of the few games that managed to transcend the notion of videogame permeating into the general pop culture and achieving the status of legend

more than recommended almost mandatory

#####

portal 2 is a musthave for every steam account

#####

timeless masterpiece a textbook example of how a video game should be
splendid pacing narrative always flows without major interruptions and the player is always in the action superb voice acting jk simmons ellen mclain nolan north that brings characters to life a great framework of story that leaves player with lots of answered and unanswered questions and it is simply fun

i wish valve kept making such great games they truly understood what players wanted they still do only difference is that they do not act on it





#####

on steam the signs of a once in a generation game are as follows

it has been out for years but tons of people still play it

the reviews are overwhelmingly positive

any negative reviews are just 5 year olds whining or people saying why are you looking for negative reviews just buy it

even if youve beaten it you keep playing anyway

your friends have it and love it and if they dont love  it why are you friends

theres more but those are all certain signs and portal 2 checks each box with a mark the size of apertures entire facility

this is a truly unique and special game which just about anyone can enjoy i would recommend it to anyone and everyone

#####

there is a reason this game is the highest rated game on steam bplay itb

#####

now im waiting for portal 3

#####

my wife loves to lock me in a room and flood it with deadly neurotoxin i love her so muhc

#####

at nearly 11 years old portal 2 is still easily one of the best games ever made its graphics hold up to a modern audience and its humour level design and setting are still a joy to experience if youre reading this because you already love it as much as i do good for you if you havent played it yet pick it up

this game is essential

#####

this is probably the most personal review ive ever written we all know this game with its puzzles and mechanics is a masterpiece  but there is far more to it imo last year i cooped the game with a guy i had in my steam friends list for about 6 years the coop was so nice and entertaining that we decided to meet in rl and it turned out that rl teamwork was just as awesome as our ingame coop for half a year weve been a couple now and we will be moving together soon so if anyone ever tries to tell you steam is not a dating platform wether you want to hear that or not  in this case it was  best dating game i ever played thanks for the awesome job valve

#####

before i played portal 2 i had a small wee wee no friends no girlfriend depression and absolutely no will to live none of these things have changed but the game is pretty good coop is nice 

#####

one of the most brilliant games ever made the gameplay humor characters and wittiness are astonishing the coop was some of the most fun i ever had do yourself a favor and get this and the first portal if you havent already

#####

average portal enjoyer

no steam library is complete without this masterpeice

portal was sort of a little experiment of a huge company thats why success of the first part of the portal was a surprise even for the valve therefore seriously question arose about the portal 2 and what we got lets see

　still alive

　　the game begins with the fact that chell along with her new partner personality module wheatley is trying to escape from an abandoned aperture science laboratory throughout the game the plot makes a interesting twists individual deserves compliments perfect finale after which there remain only a warm feeling in portal 2 no epic stories huge explosions incredible action or the salvation of humanity instead there is a charismatic characters intelligent humor and interesting puzzles

　one is good but two is better

　　one of the achievements of the new portal has been the emergence of the cooperative coop story is a continuation of the plot of the single player at first i thought that the only difference of the cooperative is the presence of two players with portalguns instead of one in fact the cooperative has unique ideas many puzzles solving quite differently i advise you not to play cooperative with a random person there is that possibility and play it with a good friend

　endless tests

　　in game was added a level editor so anyone can create their own test chambers or try to play the levels of other players to be honest most of the playercreated levels are too simple or ridiculous but there is sufficient interesting maps and some of them really hard in no case do not miss the community maps

　multiplayer

　　coop    o

　　　　ivalve made another good
　　game with good intelligent humor
　　charismatic characters and unusual
　　interesting gameplay

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　as expected nine out of ten 910

#####

portal 2 is like having a really smart friend who always knows the answer to everything except instead of being annoying this friend is a sassy robot who insults you at every turn and you know what im okay with that its like being roasted by your own personal glados and its weirdly enjoyable the puzzles are mindbending the writing is hilarious and the whole thing is just a perfect blend of science humor and insanity highly recommended unless youre allergic to fun or robots who want to kill you

#####

surprisingly this game can run on my potato

#####

buy this game before you buy food water or medicine

#####

thought the 2 hour unskippable sex cut scene was a bit much but over all a good game

#####

best game i have ever played
the story is the 1010
the game play is 1010
i have replayed this game at least 8 times


#####

do i even need to tell you this is a classic

#####

portal 3

#####

this is one of those games in which theres no need to leave a review because everyone already knows how great it is but you proceed to leave one anyway

#####

chell is back after what happened in the first game and being put in a relaxation vault spoilerwhere she had the risk of dying due to the apertures power outage in case you dont know whats this about read the portal comic which tells about the event portal 2 lab rat i recommend itspoiler

the story takes a turn and we dont even know who to trust until the end

the coop mode is spectacular and quite fun

the puzzles compared to the first game are more complex

the sense of humour is present just as it was in the first game

the gameplay doesnt change much compared to its predecessor

we have the possibility to play community maps through the workshop so the fun can be neverending

#####

just play this for science

#####

dont have much experience in this game but what little time i did spend playing was great fun one of my top 5 games of all time easily 1110

#####

buy it for science you monster

#####

portal 2 is what every puzzle game wants to be every puzzle is meticulously well crafted and a legitimate joy to play the narrative is strong and mysterious and will keep you guessing what will happen next the voice acting and writing are on par with rockstar and naughty dog making this one of the most wellwritten and hilarious games ever made the returning glados is a fantastic character and the new robot wheatley is also surprisingly wellwritten there is very little wrong with this game bar some nonobvious exploration sections that take up a negligible part of the game there is no lousy puzzle or wrong area and the game is paced freakishly well this game is timeless and will hold up as one of the best puzzle games ever

#####

great story great puzzles great game

#####

definitely one of the best games ever created 1010


#####

i snort crack when things get tough

#####

i will eat 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise for every like  award this review gets

#####

an amazing sequel not only does it keep the atmosphere of the first one but also upgrades everything mechanics graphics its longer and the story is just great new characters that add so much more to the universe characters that you will never forget

new puzzles of course that will challenge you and feel satisfying to complete a beautiful ending and conclusion to chells story it definitely will leave with a desire for more that you can fulfill with the coop mode or the myriad of chambers the community has been uploading over the years

just get it as soon as you can and make sure you play portal 1 first so you can enjoy 2 the most

#####

h1 one of the best games ever h1


i thats it thats my review you all know its true so i dont need evidence i

#####

people rate with game having like 10 hours and then never play it again if you are trying to decide if you want to buy the game or not and that really bugs you then im here to tell you that you can get a little bit more hours out of the game than that 

#####

a woman with millions of fan theories about without ever speaking a word
intentionally designed to be stupid british cores
cruel women cores that are really good at singing
turrets with low self esteem
a man that hates lemonade and sounds like j jonah jameson from spiderman
a potato that becomes your friend

combined together with the one of the most original gameplay ever

1010

#####

ive bought this game a month ago and i started playing it last week and im sad

sad that i didnt start to play it immediately when i bought it
sad that i didnt buy it earlier  a lot earlier
 
portal is one of the best physics based puzzler games ive played not only are the puzzles challenging but the game itself has been made a lot of fun as well with those 2 robotic personalities

#####

                         waiting
                             for portal 3 h1      
















#####

h1glados is the best waifuh1

portal 2 is probably the best puzzle game of all time and one of the best games ever made i cant believe how such simple puzzles are presented so well that the game leaves such impression

the whole gameplay is solving puzzles by using portals you can travel through you can shoot up to two portals  one being entrance and another one is where you exit after entering the first one pretty simple heh so whats so special about this game well everything the level design is outstanding theres no repetitiveness youll never be bored and puzzles itself are well thought some will be easy and some will be tougher to solve but they are done in such a manner that neither of them are too hard to frustrate you and it feels rewarding when you finally got it right

there are also parts where you just walk and even that is filled with glados talking to you to keep you entertained the areas you travel through are also beautiful and interesting to look at oh glados is not just talking it will make you laugh too whenever you start feeling that the game might become boring you suddenly get glados say something or you just solve the puzzle the pacing and great
theres also coop mode but i havent played it so cant comment on it

graphically it looks great even though its a pretty old game by now but everything is pleasing to your eye areas are more diverse than in the first game and you see less repetitive patterns

sound starting with music and ending with glados is amazing it just makes the whole game complete every sound every word every note of music every ambient sound are in their places at the right time

this is probably a puzzle masterpiece worth playing even if youre not a fan of puzzle games im not i cant recommend this game enough its must play

just get please just get

#####

take everything you love about portal then times it by five this game has so many good aspects to it its hard to know where to start

sound witty dialouge excellent voice work a really cool soundtrack and even something as simple as the sounds that the portal gun makes sound awesome

gameplay addictive

story really good there are some parts to the story where i genuinely felt threatened and isolated 

graphics nothing to complain about

although portal 2 is undoubtedly one of the best games ive played in a while there are two errors that i find with it

#1 there are parts in the game where you have to use the zoom key to find almost unfindable portable surfaces i thought this gameplay mechanic was rather silly and annoying

#2 there are parts in the game where the events that happen dont make much sense and you wonder why you have to do certain things or why youre in certain places

overall this game is one of the best games of our generation and its loads of fun its good aspects overwhelmingly outweighs my tiny nitpicked errors

#####

if your friends dont think this is one of the best games ever you need smarter friends

#####

honestly how can you call yourself a gamer if you havent played portal by now

portal is back and better than ever the tests are as mind bending as ever and theyve added new elements like light bridges and emancipation gates the graphics are smooth and attractive but nothing thats going to make your jaw drop the controls are as simple and effective as the first game but then none of that was what worried me i had no doubt that they would be able to recreate and expand upon the technical aspects of the first game 

my concern was whether or not they would manage to capture and continue the personality and sense of humor of the first game i am very pleased to report that the sequel does not disappoint the sequel pics up right where the first game left off and glados holds a grudge her insults passive aggressive comments and general malice will have you chuckling throughout the game your new companion and guide robot also adds to the character of the game though he can be a bit heavy handed at times 

if you enjoyed the first game you will love the sequel both for its expanded challenges and its unique personality as long as you enjoy a good puzzle and have a sense of humor you will never regret this purchase

#####

masterpiece

#####

its not very often i go back  review something i played almost a decade ago but ive been thinking quite a bit about the state of aaa gaming recently and inevitably came to one single conclusion portal 2 is perhaps the best game of the past 10 years

in a world where big budget games tend to be focused on either the cinematic instead of gameplay draining your wallet through nefarious lootbox systems or perhaps worst of all attempting to be everything while not really succeeding at being anything see every open world action adventure story driven experience with rpg elements  coopmultiple support portal 2 just shines like a beacon of game design a game where the gameplay never once suffers because of the story and the story never once suffers because of the gameplay

if i wanted to sit down  watch 20 minutes of drama with zero input id finally get around to watching breaking bad  why on earth would i want that in a video game thankfully portal 2 manages to tell a both dramatic  hilarious story without detracting from the gameplay experience which itself is spectacularly enjoyable in its own right that unique marriage of narrative  gameplay is whats left portal 2 at the forefront of my mind now more than 9 years later

in addition the art continues to age well  the soundtrack is one of the best of its kind out there if that wasnt enough the workshop community has seemingly added a ton of extra content to the game over the years so if you ever feel like the game is over but you want some more addictive portal puzzle solving action theres plenty to be had

overall as late as this review is relative to the release of the game i couldve wrote it just as easily back in 2011 portal 2 is a special game  looking at everything thats followed it since its release just highlights further what a brilliantly unique title it is

portal 2

#####

iportal 2i is a firstperson science fiction puzzleplatform game and the sequel to the series taking place in aperture sciences enrichment center consisting of numerous test chambers

the game features both singleplayer and cooperative game modes singleplayer mode provides an immersive story while the cooperative game mode is a new way to play the game being able to cooperate with a friend to solve puzzles and achieve common goals is a great experience

the storytelling is very impressive the unusual humor the game has makes it very special the game is much longer than the first game even without including the cooperative courses

the game includes more diverse mechanics compared to the first game the mechanics are so much fun and creative there is even an incredibly useful upgrade to the handheld portal device

understandably playing games with outdated graphics might not be easy for some players outdated graphics in puzzle games may cause headaches and nausea unlike the first game the graphics are not out of date the game still stands strong in terms of visuals after many years

with its originality iportal 2i is a mustplay puzzle game and a perfect example of a successful sequel making the first game feel more like a tutorial it is also a great privilege to meet cave johnson please keep in mind that there are no cakes in this game only lemons and a potato

#####

nice story
classic
amazing soundtrack
cheap if bought in summer sale etc


no cake tho

#####

complete this game without a walkthrough and you can officially say i am not a moron

#####

glados is hot

#####

portal 2 is an absolute masterpiece the voice acting is some of the best that ive ever heard the puzzles are just hard enough the game runs beautifully it is just enjoyable if you look at the single player if youve considered buying this game and havent yet do it the only bad part about this game is that now that im finished with it i can never experience it for the first time again

next target  coop campaign

#####

honestly im still baffled and im clueless how to start this review im still clueless how they set the bar for their prequel this high and even provided with a better sequel i cant wait to jump into the coop function honestly since the singleplayer was this good

valve literally took a look at portal and said what could we improve towards the sequel they added new general features like a loading screen which i didnt find mandatory and you can see where your portals are placed through walls they stuck with similar ideas to complete their puzzles and added loads of new ways to solve puzzles and move along the map speaking of puzzles they added so many that it seems that the game is twice as long as the prequel they added lasers and with them you have cubes which you can use to direct the lasers in any way you want  you have bouncing pads and on walls you see indicators which show where you land you have bridges to guide you around the map you also have floating pads which can work in two directions but only when triggered by a button finally you have three kinds of gel red blue and white red gel gives you a speed boost blue gel gives you a jumping boost and white gel allows you to portal on it mainly for places that you couldnt portal on before

obviously the things previously said arent the ones that baffled me but it is mainly the environment the story is amazingly well built and it teaches us more about apeture sciences it also contains a few plot twists here and there the places you visit are fairly new but youll visit some well remembered places from portal something they also introduced is companions the most part of the game youll have a object travelling with you one of them is a funny little core with a british accent aside from entertaining you the bots can help you sometimes to get to certain paths the jokes are as good as last game so expect a good laugh

i highly recommend  that you buy this game and play it for the rest of the day or week turn off your notification because the game doesnt support tabbing and enjoy this gem for many and many times you want and are supposed to complete the story edit you also can choose from many maps from the community to test out so you wont get tired of the story and you can still play

#####

i really like the game but i couldnt find the stupid cake

#####

yes i love wheatley
yes i love this game
yes i want a 3rd one
yes im sad valve is dead

posted april 17 2011

the highest rated game on steam the best puzzle game ever fathomed the 2nd best game ever created and #1 worst dev moderation in history 

a game with limitless potential with a limited ability to reach it

a game with so much nostalgia that its players become forever stuck in 2011

a game with such good comedy that people mistake it for a sitcom instead of a puzzle game

a puzzle game whose players dont like solving puzzles

a game full of paradoxes literally

a game full of sarcasm 

really and truly there is no other game like portal 2 in existence because there has never been another game that comes close to portal 2s sheer amount of wasted potential if only valve would add a level editor and workshop people would be able to play free high quality puzzles indefinitely and never have to buy another game in their life with the community in charge of creating content there would be thousands of new maps for people to play and test their brains with every week if i were to make predictions this level editor should contain

1 all portal 2 test elements including reflection gel and sendificators

2 all the extra valvemade fizzler variants not used in the main campaign for some odd reason

3 all test elements from portal 1 including cube deflectors flux fields positron orbs and lifeform sensors

4 the ability to choose between portal 2s aesthetic styles maybe even portal 1 with matching element variants

5 the ability to add custom background music from either game i especially love halted production and sin

6 an easy resizable grid system for more complex and puzzlerelevant architecture

7 an efficient brush compiler with optimized entity instances

8 the ability to add custom music and screenshots

9 other cool and unique options for different test elements

its amazing how valve came up with all these cool new ideas thank you so much for all your work we cant wait to participate in all the future mapping competitions youll hold as for workshop integration the only problem i foresee is people posting unsolvable puzzles on it but if they just add a mechanic like mario maker where you have to beat your own level before publishing it that should fix the issue oh wait you say mario maker wont be released until 2015 and i just violated our nda no dissenters allowed contract welp guess i better change my identity and make a new account see you in court mate

bportal 2b takes everything that was done right in the first game and injects it with steroids it boasts a longer more diverse campaign that still manages to hold on to the humor atmosphere and overall quality that made the original so enjoyable it also boasts a new cooperative mode which brings the experience to a new level and to top it off with steam workshop integration the possibilities for new content become limitless

in the campaign all of the strengths from the first game return and are finetuned to perfection the puzzles are more diverse and interesting with more advanced mechanics introduced the atmosphere is even more fleshed out and enticing the dialogue is even more hilarious and entertaining and to top it all off the game is about twice as long

after that there is also an incredibly well designed cooperative mode complete with its own characters and puzzles this adds what is effectively another whole game to the mix which is a very welcome addition

and to top it all off with the steam workshop integration there is endless possibilities for new puzzle rooms in both singleplayer and cooperative modes not all of it is great of course but some of it is arguably better than the real game  it is a gift that just keeps on giving

with the gameplay being so intuitive and enjoyable and the limitless possibilities of the workshop bportal 2b rockets to the clouds as a deity among video games  it is handsdown one of the absolute best games in existence  if you havent yet tried it now is the time  there are hours of entertainment waiting for you

portal 2 is the sequel to portal and adds more puzzles and more fun
at the beginning of portal 2 chell is awakened in a longterm relaxation chamber in aperature science by a little hilarious british personality named wheatley wheatleys goal is to help you escape however you soon find out that glados is still alive chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected glados the story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact
the gameplay from the original game returns in all of its mindbending glory players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits transport weighted storage cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers additions to the gameplay include the propulsion and repulsion gels which do pretty much as they describe either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air in addition players must redirect light bridges and conveyer beams with portals as well
one of the most exciting new features in portal 2 is the inclusion of coop gameplay
coop gameplay gets its own storyline and characters aperture science robots atlas and pbody each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve you can either play with a friend splitscreen or online or team up with a random player
i highly recommend portal 2 to anyone who is looking for a good fun game that will take up a few hours and even make you think instead of the average first person shooter 
overall portal 2 is a masterpiece and definitely worth the money

damn this game is good i think at this point everyone knows what the portal series is so ill just point out some of the highlights
the story is great with interesting characters and a perfect pace the plot twists are well done and it only tells you what you need to know the story is also supplemented by the great humor
of course its a puzzle game so the puzzles and level design need to be good luckily theyre done flawlessly on top of that the environments are also amazing and add lots to the world
once youre done with the story mode theres a level creator that is perfectly made and allows you to do just about anything you want people have used this to make some crazy and amazing levels the community while im not sure how active it is now has always been very helpful and creative youll never run out of content as long as talented map creators exist
definitely a must play for anyone its only 20 and worth every penny

daddy i want a portal gun  my 6 year old tells me one afternoon  um sure okay i say  the idea never enters my mind that he is talking about a video game  a few days later i notice something while he is playing scribblenauts  right there in his inventory of scribbly things is a portal gun  

the portal gun

 ohhhh i say  now it hits me  where on earth did he see that  i must be a terrible parent  okay  daddy can play for you  i say with a gleam in my eye  we proceed to install portal 1 right when i start the game he grabs the keyboard and takes over  before i know it hes blazing right through the levels  then he says lets play portal 2

portal 2

yes i want to play portal 2   well  i actually do own portal 2 so fair enough  its been on my backlog for too long  we proceed to install portal 2  and on to the beginningits as if we are transported to a movie  hes a little scared  i ask him if he wants to stop its okay  it may be too scary  he squirms around but as soon as the puzzles start he is all over it  wow this little guy really knows how to play  physics in a hole  whatever  a 6 year old is blazing through this  he gets stuck on level 15  i get stuck on level 15 too  this puzzle is wrecking my brain but then i realize i simply did not notice something  solved and on to the next  the both of us play through the game off and on for a few months he turns 7 and we put in a good chunk of puzzle solving together along with a fair amount of coop play  i even bought a controller adapter for a ps controller so we could play side by side  a week ago we both finished it  on the really scary parts i let him leave the room   i cant remember the last time i had so much fun completing a game with a partner  my own little guy  thanks valve for making a great game that is a also a wonderful fatherson game to play together  he proudly wears an aperture laboratories tshirt now

portal 2 is one of my alltime favorite games and easily one of the best puzzle games ever made the story and characters are well written and the gameplay is incredibly fun and challenging the graphics and sound design are topnotch and the level design is masterful the games sense of humor is also a standout feature i love how the game tests my problemsolving skills while also making me laugh the coop mode is also a great addition and adds a whole new level of fun and challenge overall portal 2 is a game that i highly recommend to anyone who loves a good puzzle game its a masterpiece in every sense of the word

#####

i cannot believe it took me this long to write a review about this game i wrote an essay about how good it is for an english class before i wrote a review talking about how good it is

long overdue i honestly dont even know where to begin with this masterpiece this game is hands down the best one i have ever played in my life an improvement on the first one in all the right ways this game is potentially the only singleplayer experience i have had a proper craving for the only experience that i have genuinely felt that going back and replaying is the thing i want to be doing

in the essay that i wrote about portal 2 i spoke at length about all of the fancy rhetoric that the game employs to convey various emotions and force the player into a mindset the big thing i noticed was how well the game uses the physically small map to portray this massive sense of scale in the essay i focused more on how it forces the player into experiencing something akin to a trapped freedom where you have the opportunity to do whatever you want but in a certain space in retrospect i should simply have written about the way that the game conveys lonely companionship fearful trust and reliance on someone openly trying to kill you it tears out your deepest emotions and plays with them trying to and succeeding in making you feel two conflicting emotions simultaneously this is a powerful way to write a story and portal 2 pulls it off flawlessly

with a mix of toptier voice acting fluid animation realistic interactions interesting characters an amazing story the usage of a silent protagonist and the lack of cutscenes entirely the game feels realistic and involved the game doesnt break immersion for a second while remaining tense it manages to employ humour and does everything tastefully

i cant rave about everything in one review because it frankly will turn into another 20 page essay like the last one did the tldr of this is that the game does everything a game should do flawlessly


this is the best game ever made and nothing can change my mind

if you like portal 1 you love portal 2
if you not like portal 1 you like portal 2

portal 2 is the follow on to the extremely successful first person original the game retains all of the game play elements from portal 1 and adds lots of new features such as bridges made from light beams and splashing paint gel which accelerate your speed or make you jump higher 

in the single player campaign you play as chell as with the original portal your character can take a small amount of damage before they die thankfully like the original you dont take fall damage still  the aim of the story mode is to explorer the aperture science lab which is filled of complex puzzles that have a clear exit point but there are also other parts of the game which are not so clear leaving the objects less clear

the tutorial at the start of the game explains all of the game play elements very well and gets you well prepared for the on coming puzzles and whenever there is a new element introduced the game does a very good job of making you aware what it does without shoving a tutorial screen in your face every time

portal 2 is powered by the source engine like all of valves more recent releases half life 2 left 4 dead tf2 and it looks stunning you will find it hard nowadays to find a game that looks as well polished as portal 2 all of the colours textures and visual effects are done perfectly 

storywise is the feature in portal 1 that i thought it fell down on however in portal 2 they knocked it out of the park it follows on from the story line set in the original and goes beyond the level of detail and complexity that you would expect i needed to find out how it ended once i started playing and the ending is just beautifully crafted 

the difficulty is like most puzzle games if you are good at them it will just come naturally it definitely has a better difficulty curve when compared to the original but even still at times i had to revert to a walkthrough to pass through some puzzles shame on me eh but there is nothing here that cant be solved if you sit and think for a couple of minutes each time

the single player story mode took me about seven hours to complete this to me is a perfect length for a game of this type the game ends at a high point and i was 100 satisfied with the outcome there is also a coop campaign included which will also add a good number of hours on top of both of these we also have steam workshop support meaning endless hours of mods and different chambers to try and master i have yet to try any out yet but some of the maps and rooms i have seen on the workshop page just look amazing i wouldnt be surprised to see people being able to get fifty plus hours in this game 

in conclusion portal 2 is a must play for any gamer out there it is an absolute classic that should certainly be in your library it goes on sale every few months so most people will already have it but you need to play it

portal 2 takes elements of adventure puzzle platform and firstperson action games and blends them into a unique genre mix it builds on the foundation of its acclaimed predecessor takes all the gameplay elements that made it great and vastly improves them in every aspect with that said i strongly recommend to play portal first if you dont you will still play through the sequel without any confusion portals plot was minimal even though exceptionally wellwritten and the basic puzzle design is picked up in portal 2 but you would miss out on a great game and why would you want to do that

once again you take over chell portals female protagonist who finds herself rudely awakened from a cryogenic sleep and imprisoned in a small chamber inside the aperture science testing facility an environment vaguely familiar from portal  vaguely because a lot seems to have changed since your first time around some of the structures at the beginning of the game are indeed places you have already seen during your first escape but this time they are clearly aged in a state of decay overgrown with plants and seemingly abandoned but soon you will have to make your way through unknown terrain and new test chambers that turn out to be anything but abandoned fans of portal will be pleased to learn that glados makes its reappearance something else is different right from the start you are now accompanied by a britishaccented robot named wheatley who insists that an escape can only be accomplished together

portal 2 really shines in the writing department the story is much more developed compared to the first installment many unanswered questions are revealed such as bits and pieces of aperture sciences history and the origin of glados personality where glados was portals only speaking character you now get to hear your goofy sidekick wheatley and through prerecorded messages aperture science founder cave johnson all voice actors did an outstanding job and manage to really bring all three speaking characters to life

if you played firstperson shooters before you will be instantly familiar with the controls mouse for camera movement wasd to move space to jump and left  right mouse buttons to shoot your portal gun all game mechanics from portal like pressure buttons disintegration fields and of course the eponymous blue and orange portals that are surprisingly simple in theory but make for surprisingly diverse and challenging puzzles made it into the sequel and in addition many more are added different sorts of gel that let you jump higher or run faster catapults light bridges air tubes and lasers each element of its own already makes for complex puzzles but once the game starts to combine several of them youre in for a real challenge

compared to its predecessor the game provides a lot more content not only is the single player campaign about twice as long it even adds an extensive second coop campaign two players open a lot more puzzle opportunities and the devs managed to use them to their fullest but dont worry you are given various means of communication its recommended to simply plugin your headset and make use of steams voice chat feature but even if you dont you can still highlight spots by simply pressing a key start countdowns to synchronize your actions open a small screen that lets you look through the eyes of your coop partner and perform small gestures to communicate nonverbally or you could just utilize the ingame chat to write

but it doesnt end here thanks to user generated content the replayability is almost unlimited when you mastered both campaigns just tap into the huge library of player generated chambers even whole campaigns are available to download and keep playing with ever new challenges

when you compare the visuals to portal you cannot help but appreciate the excellent graphic design while portals test chambers looked bland and lifeless theyre now impoved with many small details you have moving transforming environments plants growing through cracks in the walls and especially the vast subterranean areas later in the game are a stunning sight

long story short portal 2 takes the premise of its predecessor and takes it to a whole new level a game for the books

portal 2  november 27 2019  

one of the best games ever made humor mechanics puzzles that requires actual thought great price for a game that aged very well

#####


















#####

amazing game even better than the first  its practicly given away at this point so no reason for anyone that has steam to not have this game

#####

this game has an amazing story that kept me so tied in that i would be caught playing for hours on end and i enjoyed every second of it it legitimately depresses me that no game will give me the same feeling that portal has given me ever again the entire atmosphere of this game makes you feel like you are alone with incredible views and silence in most parts of the game which i happen to love when there are characters they have lovable voices and personalities that keep you engaged to listen to their back and forth witty comments the game play is of course incredible even when i was stuck on some of the puzzles the game managed to keep me fighting on and trying again valve has done a great job of using the materials they created to make new and exotic puzzles over and over again if you read this review and want to see the game please do not watch any game play or get spoiled in any way whatsoever this is an experience you want to have on your own and one you will miss when it is over thank you valve for this masterpiece

combustible lemon

feeling dumb together

#####

i wonder if any of this backstory existed when the first one was created it is a nice mix of prequel and sequel an equel and i found it just as interesting enjoyable and funny as the original  i look forward to and hope for portal 2 episode 2 sometime before my untimely death

after almost 1000 hours of playing this game i finally feel like writing a review i love this damn game its litterally the magnum opus of valve and even after 1000 hours on it i still find the comedy funny and it never really gets dry there are many mods for the game that keep the community up and running like portal stories  mel portal reloaded and aperture tag there are also good mods in the making like desolation with a dedicated team of modders behind it i highly recommend you play this game as its loads of fun even if puzzle games arent your cup of tea they are not hard to overcome and every part in a chamber has something to do with the puzzle itself there is also coop mode and it offers even more content aswell as letting you play with your friends its price is definetely worth it for the ammount of content youre getting

#####

if you played portal 1 and liked it you are going to love portal 2 it has everything that the previous game had to offer and much more

the campaign is much larger than the previous one with a bunch of new mechanics as well what really shines here though is the fantastic voice acting from the antagonists wheatley is hilarious with his british accent and glados just being cynical and awesome as always
it has a lot more challenges as well and the multiplayer works perfectly 

the game is a masterpiece indeed

#####

portal 2 is the second and last official installment of the portal series released in 2011 by valve

in my opinion this game adds a lot to the original formula and improves a lot of aspects of the first game this time youll have to break out of a destroyed aperture science using your skills your beloved portal gun and 3 gels that youll have to master this is the repulsion gel the propulsion gel and the conversion gel

the plot is pretty well written and even if you havent played the first game youll understand the story as the game doesnt require a deep understanding of the first game the characters in this game feel alive and are very charismatic from the ironic and twisted glados to the incompetent and dumb wheatley the humor is well done and the dialogues especially in the later scenarios are hilarious 

the aesthetics are amazingly beautiful and also youll have a lot of these socalled screenshot opportunities even if you are playing with a lowend rig youll be amazed by the beauty that can spawn from the source engine an engine that has been around since ages

and the last but not less important aspect of the game is the soundtrack from the first time you awake from your long time sleep to the last song the ost is not only fitting but also feels like grabbing science and adapting it into an mp3 format you guys did an excellent job with it as it adds a lot to the experience

overall i recommend it to every time of gamer and nongamer if you want to get into gaming try this game if you love fps try this game if you love puzzles give this game a go and if youre a valve fan why are you reading this review in the first place get the damn game

life was meaningless

i had no purpose other than to continue my work the only thing i had ever known work had been fun at first and my boss had seemed nice and rather witty however after some time my boss began acting strange it started with the lying then my boss began to intentionally make my work dangerous i survived but only through quick thinking and a bit of luck

eventually the everyday grind of navigating my way through a neverending maze lost any appeal my boss promised me cake when the job was completely done but it wasnt worth it i wished for something anything even death that would rid me from this meaningless existence i was tempted several times to walk infront of a turret or fall into the radioactive slime but the pain these methods would bring seemed greater than the pain of a meaningless life so i carried on

then one day my boss had a surprise for me he had brought me a companion to assist me in my work or more specifically an aperature science weighted companion cube at first the companion cube assisted me with basic tasks which i nonetheless couldnt have done without it we rounded a corner and came face to face with a ball of radioactive energy coming straight towards us

i thought we were doomed but then the companion cube jumped in front of me of its own accord and shielded me from certain death my mouth dropped as i imagined the pain the cube must have been experiencing my boss said something about symptoms of enrichment center testing and perceiving inanimate objects as alive but i paid no attention i knew this was love i knew this was real

we continued on together for a while the cube was essential in completeing the task my boss had set for me i tried talking to it but i received no response my boss then oddly informed me that the companion cube would never threaten to stab me as if it would everbut more importantly he informed me that my cube was mute i felt a pang of sadness  not the selfish sadness one feels when they lose something but the true sadness that is felt when empathizing with another being

this revelation did not hamper my love for my cube my companion who had brought happiness and joy into my life and who had selflessly endured pain to save me from death after opening the final door which would lead to the elevator i had grown quite familiar with our boss seemed to congratulate us on our new found compaionship but then the bos said something which would change my life forever

however the companion cube cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and unfortunately must be euthanized please escort your companion cube to the aperture science emergency intelligence incinerator

i gasped in horror looking across the room and seeing what i now realized must be the incinerator i fell to my knees tears already streaming down my cheeks i looked at my faithful companion and proceeded to envelop it in my arms determined to never let it go

my boss continued on as if nothing was wrong while it has been a faithful companion your companion cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test if it could talk  and the enrichment center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot  it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you

you could never be a burden to me i cried and hugged my companion cube to my chest but then i remembered although my boss had lied to be at one time boss had since promised that he could no longer lie to me i had to finish the testing or else i would never get the cake and if the cube couldnt come with medidnt want to come with me

i hugged it one last time then picked myself up off the floor i walked slowly hesitantly toward the button that would open the incinerator it took more willpower than ive ever needed to press it then i picked up my companion and held it over the flames tears clouded my vision and my hands began to sweat uncontrollably and not just from the heat i held it there for what seemed like hours just crying and admiring its beauty but then i remember the cake and the cube slipped from my hands

you euthanized your faithful companion cube more quickly than any test subject on record said my boss congratulations

1110 would euthanize my companion at the behest of my boss and all for a piece of cake again

#####

i have no words that can adequately describe this game the puzzles the music the deranged artificial intelligences everything is awesome

h1portal 2 is even better than portalh1
portal 2 is another game on my must play list portal was already incredible yet somehow valve managed to make the sequel exquisite 

h1positiveh1
 fluid responsive controls
 amazing puzzles both for single player and coop
 great difficulty curve
 this time there is actually a story we finally get to learn more about aperture science
 wheatley joins the party in combination with glados their unique personalities and humour just make portal 2 incredible basically fantastic script and voiceacting
 this is not just a remake of portal this time gels are added to put a unique touch on puzzles basically an upgrade in gameplay and difficulty
 coop mode like singleplayer the coop mode is brilliantly designed and addictively fun 
 communitymade maps basically endless fun and challenges
 companion cube still loves you 3

h1negativeh1
 spoilerstill no cakespoiler
 you require a competent buddy for coop

h1conclusionh1
valve really outdid themselves this time there really isnt much else to say the praise i gave in my portal review is just as valid here although it must be said that portal 2 deserves even more praise  byou would be a fool not to play portal and portal 2b

definitely one of the best games ever created 1010

#####

no steam account is complete without this game thats the only kind of gatekeeping i will go for

#####

i wish this game would be released in vr in some time at the future

#####

ah how i remember having first played this with a friend and then my boyfriend he and i did the coop together prior to doing the singleplayer mode bothwas definitely a blast

portal 2 has all the ingredients to being a great physics puzzle game along with the interesting story in the solomode for coop you play as atlas or pbody who must solve all the puzzles presented in each stage as instructed by glados i will not go into too much detail of who glados is but this feminine voiced ai is not exactly the brightest guide with good intentions she has made sinister comments towards the players or individually as a way to cut down trust and teamwork despite the entire point of coop mode being working together ive heard glados mention things like me performing better than my partner and viceversa as well as hints of betrayal all of which i find hilarious both coop and solo mode has these factors which keeps the entire game very interactive and thrilling despite portal 2 being a puzzle game my boyfriend and i enjoyed our times of thinking testing and trying tricks and tactics to get the level cleared

in solo mode we continue off from its prequel playing as the main character chell who mistakenly stars up glados while in the aperture science laboratory glados is of course the antagonist spoilerat least for the first halfspoiler were guided by wheatley another ai residing in aperture science for some period of time spoileruntil glados is taken downspoiler regardless of which mode you play there is also some fourth wall breaking too where the player is challenged to act against what they are instructed to do plot twists and dark truths about the aperture science laboratory are impliedhinted within certain stages if you look hard enough

the graphics and audio are what youd expect from portal if not better the soundtrack had songs like want you gone and the turret opera song from the end of the game which were stuck in my head after completing the solo mode no complaints here

my only negative experience for the game is that i was incapable of playing it for prolonging hours due to motion sickness portal 2 will have your screen spinning flipping and some flashing graphics here and there so make sure you have the settings set right before letting nausea ruin the experience lol

steam achievements a workshop for custom levels and a scoreboard exists for if you want to play competitively in each stagelevel i love this game and hope that for some miracle valve will make a sequel wishful thinking on my part portal 2 is a mustplay if you havent done so already

#####

very fun did nut

#####

my gambling addict friend said if i post a review on portal 2 and it gets 350 likes and 150 awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka so im just gonna leave this here

fatty adopted fatty fatty fatty no parents

#####

portal 2 is a fantastic puzzle game and remains as a timeless classic 910

#####

having just completed portal i was ready for portal 2 portal 2 improves everything the story is more front and center than in the first portal glados dialogue is vicious as she mocks chell nothing is off limits with glados this go around there were several times i was shocked by her remarks

iscience has now validated your birth mothers decision to abandon you on a doorstep

most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished i want to congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few pounds

waddle over to the elevator and well continue the testingi

lines like these really add to the animosity glados has for chell and just add to the story wheatly cave johnson and the voice acting are perfect i loved exploring those sections of the facility as well as completing the various test chambers

portal 2 added a lot of new mechanics that really added to the game yes portals are fun but figuring out how to use portals with light bridges conversion gel propulsion gel repulsion gel and excursion funnels was immensely satisfying portal 2 is amazing inventive funny and exciting the final battle was out of this world and the final scenes leave you wanting more

#####

it goes without saying this is exceptionally one of the greatest firstperson shooter games that doesnt require real bullets competitive teamwork accurate aiming targets and most other common mechanics that are found in that specific genre to make such a fantastic and charming game this title demonstrates what it always had shown in the prequel perfect gameplay and immersive storytelling thus this sequel opens the gateway to the remarkable portal series

now imagine all of those unanswered questions and obscure mysteries that linger within the first game and how this sequel answers nearly all those said questions with the utmost scientific explanations through the lines of entertainment from this one from what i could honestly tell you this game took the first games mechanics and widened the story much more bigger and exceptionally better portal 2 is by far worthy of the game of the year 2011 awards

#####

potato glados

#####

it just goes to show people with brain damage are the real heroes in the end arent they at the end of the day brave

#####

this video game changed my life

#####

valves proof that even a puzzle can be an aaa goty masterpiece

#####

i bought this with my partner to play coop together and i think i speak for both of us when i say we enjoyed this game very much we did the mistake of doing the extra optional difficult missions right away before doing the main story due to our lack of reading skills which made things harder than necessary since we sort of skipped the tutorial but it was a fun but challenging experience nonetheless we have yet to finish the main coop or the singleplayer missions but i would like to praise the game regardless because it truly is a fun game to play where you have to use your brain a little and when playing coop you have to work together which was an overall very positive experience

i will update my review after completing the game if it somehow changes my mind but for 90 off on sale cost  1 usd this game is an absolute steal and i cannot recommend it enough if you grab it while discounted the game may be old but the graphics hold up pretty good i would say

#####

portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games ive ever played the levels are very well designed the characters are memorable the dialogues are humourous the puzzles can get confusing at times but not impossible to solve multiplayer is a lot of fun and the story is great especially glados and chells relationship i absolutely love this game

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdvvzaz8yo6o

#####

before you buy this game

note that after playing your brain will explode with knowledge
understand that your iq will increase
know that it may contain traces of smooth jazz
deduce that portal 2 is worth your time

realise you have been warned

#####

good game

#####

if only valve could count to 3

#####

this game is great for rainy days

#####

the single player story is one of my all time favourites for any game the graphics are also extremely good especially considering how long ago the game was released definitely worth playing

#####

timeless masterpiece finished it long ago and it still has infinite replay value with mods and custom levels

#####


the only two holes i went into

#####

great game with good puzzles and gameplay its really entertaining 
can be challenging sometimes makes you use your brain real good
funny characters and dialogues 
no bugs at all for me at least
this game should be more expensive imo

#####

my four year old son played this game so much with subtitles it taught him how to read and write 

as well as how to solve three dimensional puzzles i guess

cant recommend highly enough as a teaching aid babysitter and as a tool to instil a dark sense of humour in anyone

#####

one of the better games released by valve really had fun playing the single player and multi player mode with my friend

#####

glados well this is the part where he kills us

wheatly hello this is the part where i kill you

#####

would definitely recommend this game you have to remember though its a thinking game you might be well acclimated fps games but its always a welcome change its grown over the years with addons and mods making it even better

#####

perfect game dialogs plot logic puzzles  everything at highest level

#####

the cake is a lie

portal 2 is a firstperson puzzle game developed and published by valve and released in april 2011 portal 2 incorporates a campaign that allows you to solve challenging puzzles while treating you to a strong and simple storyline this review will discuss the campaign the voice acting dialogue and the coop feature

portal 2 features a quality campaign that emphasises creativity through overcoming puzzles and excels in superb voice acting that includes funny humour you begin the campaign as chell a female character holding a portal gun chell completes tests using her portal gun while being monitored by ai computer system glados voiced by ellen mclain chell completes these tests while listening to wheatley a programming core that is voiced by stephen merchant in which he wants to escape the facility the puzzles are diverse and i do not grasp the notion they are repetitive they do in fact become more difficult as the game progresses which is due to new things being added to each level that add a new layer of complexity for instance some levels feature turrets that can spray bullets at you which you must destroy before advancing portal 2 has a really good ending that ends the story with an amazing final mission that mixes both emotion and intensity furthermore the ending smoothly transitions into the credits that completely alter the atmosphere into a beautiful light hearted finale complete with a song sung by glados briefly the single player experience does have some annoying glitches with freezing when pressing r for the feedback prompt and frequent crashing via alt tabbing these two issues had minimal impact on my experience of the game

the dialogue enhances the single player component by incorporating witty humour with dialogue that provides excellent characterisation to the characters for instance events showcase characters change of heart and provide some emotion to their robot personalities this creates a juxtaposition of humans and robots because the game reveals human traits of emotion selfinterest for personal gain and relationships with other individuals within glados and wheatley both whom are robots the voice acting in portal 2 complement the strong dialogue because individually stephen merchant delivers a memorable and excellent performance for wheatley by striking different voice tones that match different situations within the game meanwhile ellen mclain provides a good voice line to showcase the personality and character of glados the dialogue and voice acting immediately created a sense of whose a protagonist and antagonist in the simple story of hero vs villain

the coop element of portal 2 provides more levels to lengthen the game these levels add some exciting fresh dynamics to each level because you have to cooperate with your team mate and depend on the other to complete levels for instance i had to stand on a button while my friend flew to the other side of the window to retrieve the block in order to complete the level

h1 b conclusion b h1
portal 2 is a good and challenging puzzle game that emphasises creativity and excels in the simplicity of telling a story the story nicely builds to an excellent climax that feels like a satisfying conclusion to the game the game features beautiful voice acting and some exceptional performances from merchant and mclain and strongly delivers in the quality of the dialogue i am new to the puzzle genre so playing portal 2 felt fresh and different there are some issues outlined above in the game but nothing that detracts from the overall experience at 1999 i recommend it 

rating 8510

h1 b pros b h1
	 the simple story that ends with an excellent climax
	 excellent voice acting
	 very good dialogue 
	 the challenging and increasingly complex puzzles
	 length

h1 b cons b h1
	 annoying glitches with the r feedback prompt in single player and frequent crashes via alt tabbing

cooperative multiplayer
ah but portal 2s delights dont end there the game boasts a cooperative multiplayer mode thats as delightful as having a partner in crime working together with a friend or perhaps a friendly rival to solve intricate puzzles and communicate through ingame gestures is as charming as watching a synchronized dance routine

the cooperative puzzles require seamless teamwork and communication which can lead to hilarious moments of miscommunication and botched portal placements but remember in the world of portal 2 even the most disastrous mistakes can end in peals of laughter

graphics and sound
portal 2s visual design is as polished as a shiny new aperture science test chamber the environments are a testament to the games attention to detail from the decaying ruins of the facility to the pristine test chambers that beckon you like a magicians invitation

the sound design is equally impressive with a captivating soundtrack that complements the gameplay like a welltimed drumbeat the voice acting particularly the performances of glados and wheatley is nothing short of stellar deserving accolades like a standing ovation

challenging and rewarding

h1great gameh1

portal 2 is a continuation of a very good first part the game is based on the same mechanisms as the first part and adds elements that make the game better

im mainly talking about cooperation mode its done so well that i think its more interesting than the single player mode and more fun to play of course the storyline is very good but the ability to solve puzzles with a friend appeals to me more the boards are made in such a way that we are unlikely to finish them by ourselves and the cooperation is very important here

of course our main object that we need to complete the game is the gun portal just like in the previous part it does not introduce any innovations it works on the same principle as before that is it can create two portals between which we can move

we need to mention the riddles that await us during the game we will come across simple trivial puzzles which will take us literally a while to solve but we will also find some that we will have to spend more time on this discrepancy makes the game more diverse and friendly even for younger players

the graphics are very good for the year of the game release the locations are nice they contain various details despite the old engine the graphics can really make an amazing impression

h1summaryh1

portal 2 is definitely one of the best games ive played its hard to find any mistakes the game is just great we have an interesting storyline good cooperation mode easy and difficult puzzles all in all the only thing i can attach to is a few bugs but they are so few that they do not affect the pleasure of the game

portal 2 is a phenomenal game by valve and a true successor to its first one not my first time playing this ive played this before steam like 4 times and now this completing it in 6 hours is kinda short looking forward to trying the coop such an amazing story visuals gameplay everything on par especially the design of the gigantic structures just like how in halflife theres black mesa not to forget about the voice acting in general is the cherry on top imo jk simmons nailed it voicing cave johnson making me imagine how his facial expression was every time he talks i wish if there is a new portal game in the works or going to be who knows overall highly recommended every gamer or a newcomer should play this 1010

#####

pirated this game back in the day it was so good that i had to buy it for eel dis time

#####

just maybe possibly perhaps very likely the best game ever
but you probably already know that

#####

portal 2 is a masterpiece a work of art that you will love with its ingenious pop culture logic puzzle references and cooperative multiplayercompared to the first part has more levels and takes longer to pass than the first parti advise everyone to pass a legendary game


#####

when life gives you lemons dont make a lemonade 


sell em and buy this game

#####

there is no describable feeling for the pang of sadness i get whenever i replay a valve game knowing they will never put their all into a game ever again alyx is nice but the earlier halflife games and portal were something special

#####

great game i really wish theres a portal 3

gets sent portal 2 as a gift

amazing game truly defines the puzzle genre while acting as a great sequel to portal read the end for a tldr

campaign is flawless it offers a more indepth journey through aperture that the first game could never accomplish with the original source engine campaign characters lovable exciting and not annoying one thing that games forget to do is make their characters good this game does that in just the right way that it feels like youve built a connection to the characters puzzles are easy once youve mastered them as i have but harder once you first play through the game

coop amazing taking place after the events of the singleplayer campaign you and your friend maybe someone whos played the campaign before can have a really fun time playing level editor easy and fun to use i really enjoy building levels for this game and it shows based on how many ive made you can also use the hammer editor to build more indepth and custom levels but if you are new to level design and want something simple to start you out this game is for you

community levels sometimes fun sometimes boring you never really know what youre going to get with a level from the workshop it could be either be a masterpiece made with the hammer editor or a test chamber made by a 5 year old who thought walking to the exit without having a puzzle was hard there are also coop community levels that can yet again be played with your buddy if you and your partner had a really fun time playing then youll probably enjoy working together to beat community levels of course you still never know what youre gonna get

community mods or 6 part levels these just add more game that you would want to replay there are some really good standalone free mods on the steam shop right now if you want to pick them up some really good steam mods portal stories mel aperture tag the paint gun testing inititive thinking with time machine here is a list of some 6part levels that i would personally recommend wheatleys unscientific tests minecraft in portal 2 cosmogny and many more

only bad point in this game there are coop cosmetics that are not required but still act as inapp purchases if you are so inclined to buy them the entire store is only about 10 dollars which kinda balances it out though

tldr campaign is really good coop is really fun level editor is a excellent introduction to level design community levels you really dont know what youre gonna get played 6 hours of custom levels today and i wanted to die at the end includes coop community levels so you and your partner can want to die together sarcasm

final review finally right 810 valve youve knocked it out of the park once again hopefully half life alyx will bring us the same experience

the villain most in need of a hug award

portal 2 is the phenomenal sequal to valves awardwinning portal 

many were dubious about portal 2 prior to the release due to how amazing portal was feeling that nothing could live up to it unless the game were truly amazing valve managed to pull that off by miles

portal 2 is hugely fun with a remarkable and hilarious storyline which blends so perfectly from the first game its almost seamless with stephen merchant bringing an extra layer of awesome as the memorable character wheatley 

on top of the great story you have the map maker which provides hours and hours of enjoyment on top of the original packaged challenges 

get it

the original portal was a success i dont think anyone anticipated arguably the best part of the orange box it was a remarkably clever and original puzzle game with an absurd amount of character but to everyones disappointment it was all over too soon but we were not forsaken quite the contrary with portal 2 a direct sequel by which i mean to say you should play the original first as well as before reading this review which will inevitably spoil it valve has not only given us a bigger and better game but one of the greatest pieces of interactive entertainment ever i mean no hyperbole when i say portal 2 is an absolute masterpiece on a grand scale and a game absolutely everyone should get the chance to play

fair warning there is no way to talk about portal 2 without spoiling everything that occurs in the first game so keep that in mind if you have yet to play it by which i have to ask why the heck not disclaimers out of the way portal 2 once again places you inside aperture science an expansive underground scientific research and testing facility with fewer ethics than living test subjects which is to say just you chell reimprisoned and put to sleep for who knows how long only awakened when the entire facility is on the verge absolute destruction unlike before however you arent alone now joined by a naive little robot named wheatly with glados in pieces escape seems like a simple objective that is until someone flips a switch to turn her back on

the original portal is still one of the best written and most hilarious games ive played and yet its sequel is miles ahead of it in every possible way with only a handful of characters its amazing how charming and witty every line is hilarious clever and maybe even a little touching i cant think of a game that even comes close to matching how perfectly timed and expertly written every moment of portal 2 is its minimal cast does an amazing job of breathing life into the decrepit facility and makes the simple aspect of walking from one door to the next and immensely enjoyable activity 

and it isnt just the writing that deserves remark but how valve has implemented it to seamlessly interact with your actions characters respond to what youre doing in such a realistic manner that its hard to believe they are simply programs setup to do so with so many games relying on traditional uninteresting storytelling mechanics portal 2 moves the medium forward in ways developers need to take note of

however smartly written the dialog may be its in the portal puzzles themselves that valves intelligence really shines not content to simply reiterate the same mechanic we saw in the first game new elements such as propulsion gel and laser maneuvering cubes are added regularly and consistently expand on the basic portal mechanic in unexpected and interesting ways every time i thought id seen all the ways a mechanic could be used valve expanded the spectrum and again astounded my expectations with the outwardly simple variances in usage that never would have occurred to me even on my second playthrough the puzzles never stopped being incredibly rewarding to solve and giving me just enough of a challenge to consistently test my intellect in a wholly unique fashion

for how old the source engine is at this point youd never know portal 2 was built on it based on how it looks to this day i am utterly astonished at what valve manages to pull off with the engine and this is easily its most impressive usage to date the once sterile aperture science is now presented in a gorgeous display of disrepair walls crumbly around you lights flicker and cast dazzlingly shadows plants grow through into the facility and it all looks absolutely amazing even with its makeover aperture is still an eminently memorable and distinct place to inhabit and the increased variety in locations does an impressive job of realizing the sheer size of the facility which weve only scratch the surface of

i always forget to mention the soundtrack not because it isnt a fantastic accompaniment to your journey through aperture but because it blends so well with the rest of the game that i almost forget its there thats not a slight against it however its a complement to how suited it is for the game that i cant separate one from another its a brilliant score with so many layers i couldnt begin to pick it apart to describe it to you but thankfully i dont need to as even if for some reason you dont play the game the soundtrack is freely downloadable as for the ending well lets just say jonathan coulton is a genius and leave it at that

and then there is the coop mode yet another brilliant way valve has surprised me turning the solitary campaign into a multiplayer experience that demands cooperation this is what impresses me the most about the mode it isnt just two players going through a game designed for one but an entirely new set of levels purposely designed to force you to work with your partner to complete them its amazing what can be accomplished with two sets of portals and this is fully taken advantage of in what are perhaps the best designed puzzles in the entire game if you dont have a friend to play with go make one for this game its something you shouldnt miss out on

i cant get over it ive been impressed by valve numerous times in the past love portal to death and thought i knew what i was getting with its successor but portal 2 is so much more than that its an incredible achievement in everything it attempts from its outstanding script to the bewildering puzzles and spectacular presentation its the best game valve has ever made one of my all time favorites and without a doubt one of the mediums greatest accomplishments

now if youll excuse me theres testing to do

its a great one for creativity and nonlinear thinking some puzzles require thinking in multiple dimensions with those dimensions changing midaction at times others exploit interesting features some bugs some are known bugs that everyone eventually knows   the main story line follows the escape of main character chell from a morallychallenged ai known as glados and her bumbling sidekick wheatley  for those who revel in personal peril there are pitfalls into acid bottomless voids and numerous murderbots that appear as very menacing suppositories

#####

love this game so many memories
