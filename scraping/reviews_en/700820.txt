i wanted to like this game  i thought it would be amazing based on its description  i liked the idea of building a society each person getting their own personality exploring tactical combat your people living a life and dying and hopefully leaving the next generation better off

16 hours into it and i still cant get excited  i never get the just a few more minutes feeling

the biggest problem for me is the amount of micromanagement needed for just even a small colony  i think i got up to about 12 characters and it got so boring  i had to start naming my tribe folks as male wood for a woodcutter or female nurse entertainer so i could try and manage them from just the character pull down menu  where i was looking for a game i could grow characters and feel their personality i had to manage them purely on their function

additionally the villagers seemed to be automated in all the wrong ways  i made a caregiver  hunter  his primary job was to teach and raise kids but when not doing that i wanted him to hunt  unfortunately he spent all his time hunting so instead of getting my kids education to up around 300 path points they hovered around 100  150  developers if you are reading this you need to allow for priorities to be set  another example of poor automation  one of my villagers was a water carrier and clay digger  the intent would be for him to gather water and when enough water was gathered start digging up clay  but currently you have to craft water  so now with all the management im doing i have to take the time to craft water  if i dont then the privy or bath isnt able to be used  note to developers  allow a priority to be set based on storage thresholds  ie priority #1 craft water until there is 100 in stock then dig clay until there is only 20 water in stock then switch back to water  bottom line is that your characters automation will likely not be going in the direction you want it to and you have to micromanage some very low level crafting eg water

another problem i have is the ability to go out and explore  only starting with 56 people in the campaigns makes it very difficult to be able to go adventuring effectively quickly  first i need to get enough artisans gatherers and collectors to keep my society going  im 12 hours into a game before i can get to a point where i can craft simple weapons  but i dont have the ability to send out 45 people at once to explore and fight  thats not going to happen until the 45 hour mark ill concede that maybe i dont run the  most efficient colony so others may get to this quicker  but even the combat is difficult to follow  weapons have different means of using them ie slash vs thrust type thing  but it was never clear to me if my characters were using the method i had clicked on  ill admit my combat experience is limited so maybe it gets better as it goes

 a couple of other negative comments  
your character not only dies if it runs out of hit points but if one of hisher attributes go down to zero  this brought a whole new level of micromanagement  i now have to monitor my characters to ensure they werent going to die from doing mundane tasks

too much confusion on building and crafting  whats the difference between a wood hut clay hut and stone hut  which toy do i need to craft and for what  if i craft something it goes into my stock but now i have to remember who i crafted the item for  hey ive given the pregnancy balm to that woman and she hasnt used it in months  so you have to micromanage who crafts what then manage who gets what craft and then hope the person you provided it for uses it  oh wait the axe that you crafted for your adventurer cant be used because hisher body and mind arent high enough  so now i have to wait for them to get enough path points and hope a skilltrait comes up that allows me to raise their attribute to the correct level  but its going to be another 20 minutes before his path points will raise to that level  and i have to remember when i finally do get to them what it was i wanted to do

as your society progresses these dynamics just worsen  im not entirely sure what the benefit of a cook is or an entertainer  but i have them and im managing them but i dont know why


anyway i will say i do enjoy leveling up each character and trying to get them the best they can be  im not quite sure why i would choose a negative trait eg sloth when promoting a character but im sure im missing something

perhaps more trial and error will help me but its hard to get motivated to play this game  i wouldnt recommend it at this point

#####

yes the game is opaque as hell but fuck if it isnt fun for someone like me the mechanical complexity and unpuzzling it out is half  the fun

edit ok 10 hours later i have no idea how this game has mixed reviews ive spent 12 hours straight hooked on building my little villagers up to greatness

edit edit seriously how is this game not getting rave reviews read through the positive reviews that go more into depth if youre skeptical because it is completely absolutely 100 worth it there are some janks what ea game doesnt have them but ive been completely hooked i genuinely dont see the apparently dealbreaking issues negative reviews are talking about at all it really comes across as a lack of interest in learning and unraveling the mechanics of a game oldschool style which the first men absolutely rewards if you played and enjoyed old games like majesty  other reviews have made this comparison as well and thank goodness for it or i mightbe overlooked this gem  you will absolutely fall in love with the first men confused by mechanics thats fine the game is really not punishing for it the only thing to be aware of it that its difficult to get out of combat if you started it unprepared but theres also very little pressure forcing you to just wait until youre very prepared expect to put hours into building up your little town in what at a glance feels like slow progress but really youre constantly chipping away and get a feel of establishing and fleshing out your settlement the whole time it really is a gem of a game

#####

love the concept art style is amazing not digging the mechanics  long time basebuilding management resource survival genre favorite of all time is dungeons 3 but the ui gets in the way of my enjoyment ive been playing the lindaris level for awhile now and consulted the tutorials i could find but for me theres too many choices and the waiting the waiting for another child to be born and get old enough to actually be of function needing the nursemaid needing the teacher dude needing a lot of prosperity quite frankly i cant even remember which path 3 steps later is going to open up the job functionality im looking for as another reviewer stating i have begun naming the players after their job functions to keep everything straight while ive played rpgs before as wellfor me  theres just too many esoteric upgrades i play a guessing game hoping ive landed on the right skill tree to open up the job function i want down the road then when i get there i realize i need some other resource covered or didnt pick the right skill tree or dont have the right amount of blahblahblah to make it happen its not fun if anyone wants to say well theres a learning curve frankly i dont want to spend hours and hours and hours learning the various functions the skill trees the esoteric lore etc i just want to play the game its like watching a movie where they keep hitting you with backstory and you just want the fun to actually start ive come to realize that the game may not be for me and at 22 hours in i should feel pretty confident with the ingame mechanics i dont i hope the devs will change some things but all of this is just my opinion other people may be perfectly happy with how this game is progressing

#####

i had the bad  luck to buy this game 1 week ago and it was unique  beautiful and most of all hard  then there was an update which changed the game entirely  deleted most of the nice stuff it used to have toolsprofessionsinteraction of your people etc and now it is a common cimcity game and very easyboring
actually it is the biggest disappointment i have ever faced from an update
dont buy this game unless they return to the previous version

#####

ive been waiting for this game for a long time and its finally here yes ui is bad i mean really bad eu4  rimwold level bad but good thing is it can be fixed and developers are also aware of that situation in their shared roadmap it is stated that they will make uiux updates pathfinding has its issues but this also is not a gamebreaking and frustrating issue and also can be easily fixed
at this stage this game is full of content i love the idea behind every villager is a person with a personality and every villager is a contibuting member of a society aspect in this game this sole idea is something new and something hard to implement surprisingly it works
also custom maps are available it gives a feeling of old warcraft 3 custom maps it is in fact a complicated game but after tutorial  1 hour playtime everything become so simple good days are upon us may the devs continue on this brilliant project

#####

 art style is beautiful
 mostly autonomous peeps that can be drafter for combat andor exploration of the map

 the game has no tech tree and what your people can build and craft depends on semirandom traits you pick up for your people from leveling

 you spend alot of time trying to figure out what you should choose as level ups for your people and early on you can only guess what is actually useful and what is not

 the game has alot of resources that are very unclear on how to aquire them
 it is not clear how to advance the careers of your people and get more advanced building weapons tools etc
 due to the systems being opaque it is hard to judge what you should be doing how deep the game actually is and is it worth it to get past the learning cliff caused by the numerous stats resources and poor ui

some people might enjoy the game as it is many people will struggle due to the lackluster ui  id recommend waiting for some of the ui overhauls from the roadmap to be implemented before delving in or at least being aware that this game is currently pretty hard to get into

personally im trying to decide if i should refund use several hours more trying to figure out if the game is actually worth playing or just keep it and try again after updates as the premise of the  game does hold promise

#####

as with anything here on steam id recommend checking the playtime of the reviewers before you make up your mind this game has a learning curve to understanding the ui and the tutorial is admittedly sort of barebones at the moment  but im not holding that against the small indie team making this thing coming in expecting this game to be as polished as the juggernaut that is rimworld is a mistake and i wish more people werent ignorant of that fact this will get better in time patience is a virtue folks

what is this well this is a very unique take on the colonysimgodsim type of genre mixed with a partybased combat system its all wrapped up in a rather elaborate techskill tree combo system that gives you all sorts of unique class combinations to play around with for your pawns its definitely worth it to fans of either of those genres i mentioned as its outofthebox approach to combine the two oddly works decently

if you look into what the devs are hoping to accomplish in the future with the title as well tons of the stuff on their future plans sound awesome things should only get better

it is still rough around the edges but these guys are onto a winning formula with this and im here for the long haul

#####

if you are in the verge of trying this game or left it because you could not understand it please join the official discord
game devs and veteran players will happily help you and guide you thru

this game has a very steep learning curve not for the kind heart
it is absolutely fantastic and rewarding once you understand it
i will try my best to explain the aspects of it

colony sim build your civilization and evolve it you will need to do a lot of micromanaging most task are performed by themselves others will need to be ordered by you

survival nourishing each of their body needs is a must you will have to order them to craft some of these items

strategy you will need to organize and plan every building and all of your character skills and tasks they can perform

adventure you can get fighters ready and go explore and fight you have to micromanage the fights

development unlocking new buildings and job is very hard to understand at first join discord we will help you understand the basics of it

game developers are a lovely group they had been incredibly open minded and helpful 

i see myself sinking thousands of hours in it 

if you like a good challenge and want to be able to do things around the house do homework or tend the kids while you play  this is a game for you



#####

dont buy the game if you have no intention to pay attention 

so many comments are bitching about the ai being weird jobs not working right the game being super confusing and hard and its really not if you just watch your characters and how they behave

its a great game where you build your own village with your decisions played it a lot the past days now and it got me really hooked as i find new things that completly change the way i would play the game and its fun to think about how you approach the game itself playing the game itself feels a lot like a riddle and in generell has a very gentle and forgiving playstyle if you dont force your simcity mobile edition playstyle on it where you expect the random i do what i want shit to work out in the end

#####

desperately needs a real tutorial i could not even tell if it was a bug that my characters were sleeping multiple days and never waking up or if i had to click on something to make them wake up also clicking on items seems to do nothing definitely needs a lot more time in the development oven

#####

 the unique art style
 interesting approach to levelling the characters
 nice lore

 the incredibly unintuitive ui this is actually the main point for me eg some craftables do not appear all the time traders items can be found in the crafting menu etc
 characters block each other constantly in combat as well as noncombat even if there would be enough space to walk past each other
 price quite high for the state of the game 

cannot recommend it at this point

#####

i bought this game 3 days ago  and they just had a game changing update that changed the entire game  listen the game was hard before the update now it is so easy  its boring and the excitement of unlocking certain building is gone because they give you the requirements now 

#####

 early acess review

i cannot currently reccomend this game due to some specific issues i have with the current state of the game the players ability to efficently communicate with the colonists is lacking the player needs to do alot of repetative input to be able to achieve simple goals

i followed news of this game for quite a while becasue it looked like a really cool and interesting new take on the genre and the art is amazing
   i love colony survival games and i played alot of them in my opinion what makes the best ones stand out is to what level youre able to communicate with your settlement with communication i mean things such as  creating work orders moving colonists around to deal with threats or priorities and setting up some levels of automation
  1 my main problem is that youre very limited in terms of automating tasks alot of the tasks works fine but some does not when  you have a healthy amount of colonists leveling them up properly becomes a full time task both in time and concentration what trait was i leveling up on this guy again i tried to find a way to automate cooked food and water production but i could not find a way to do it basically you need to keep repeating the same boring process over and over again to acheive basic goals this grows old after about 10 hrs for me if the game asked of me to give specific input when it comes to weapon crafting and outfitting my villagers with equipment i dont really have an issue with that becasue its a longterm solution and meaningful progression alot of inputs to get it done but it is alot more rewarding than filling up your water supply
 2 edit this issue has been fixed in a recent patch softlocking  hardlocking progression is a nontrivial threat if you do not understand the economy of the game its quite easy to lock yourself out of progression to get more stones you need to build a building that requires stone if you run out of stones in your stores before you do this youre locked out of this resource same with wood and clay i think relativly early in the game you get acess to an inn where you can trade for resources for long term sustainability
   3 organizing against military threats is a chore and pathing in combat is not good similar to rimworld you can form a squad of drafted colonists that suspend their normal duties and instead do what you tell them to do this system works great as fas i tried it but when you want to have more than four colonists quickly responding to a threat or go out on an expedition it becomes alot more complicated becasue from what i can tell i can only have four colonists drafted at a time i can select a single colonist and rightclick on a threat to have them engage with it wich kinda works but it requires alot of player input im not sure why you can only draft four colonists at a time maybe i missed out on some mechanic to upgrade this if it is there it is hidden relativly deep into the game
   regarding pathing the pathing during combat is problematic the colonists dont seem to register and adjust to paths being blocked by other colonists they will instead try to take the same path even if it is blocked this can cause issues when fighting in chokepoints such as in between buildings in your village or terrain features if you have alot of melee dudes you need to babysit their pathing to make sure they get into combat effectivly even more player input needed

theres alot of things i like and love about the game the issues ive mentioned takes alot of the fun out of it for me however i hope the devlopers will adress these issues one way or another in the future and i will be thrilled to change this review into a positive one

questions are welcome if you want me to elaborate on my thoughts

edited part 2 issue seems to be fixed


#####

yes the game is rough around the egdes and has a pretty steep learning curve but the game has magic under the hood and once you get a grip the game is really fun  the rpg aspect of character growth through pathsjobs is totally unique this is where much of the learning curve is but again once you figure it out its really cool to watch your folks get progressively better at their jobs or widen their range of jobs  along with jobs you can develop their personalities that give bonuses to traits  the devs are active and really listen to the players many of the issues in some of these reviews are already fixed

#####

ive followed this game for a very long time and while i appreciate the hard work that has been put into it by the developers i really cant recommend it in its current state
the release date was postponed a couple of times and while a completely polished game is not expected with early access i feel it should at least be in a semibeta state that will pull players in and make them excited for a full release
unfortunately at this time the game is so buggy as to make it unplayable and i almost wish for the release date to have been postponed a little more 
that being said i am still looking forward to the game as the concept is unique and the art style is absolutely fantastic it has great potential and i hope that the development team stays as dedicated to it as it seems they have been up until now
hopefully the game will become playable soon and i am looking forward to the full release i will definitely update my review if it becomes the great game it was intended to be

#####

1 game art is very good and interesting
2 games lore is interesting
3 games ui its not selfintuitive at all so even if youre a longtime gamer youre going to have a hard time understanding what does what major issue imao
4 price is very salty for the actual stage of the game major issue imao
5 game has some campaigns scenarios and some custom ones skirmish scenarios and map editor are not avaible at the momment

#####

it seems like the devs have recently completely revamped the gameplay i purchased right after this update so i cant compare the changes but i found the game in its current state to be too barebones there is not even an active tutorial it is shown as under development some nice concepts in the game but let this one cook for another 6 months to a year

#####

im old  give me a worthwhile tutorial that actually covers game mechanics and i probably wouldnt have refunded i will wait and see how it turns out down the line

#####

i have spent a long time following this game and waiting for release initially i will admit i was disappointed the game art is beautiful with some amazingly different features however there is often a reason that almost all games stick to a standard recipe at least in the basics of the game
tfm doesnt stick to the recipe it laughs at the recipe it throws the recipe out the window and does its own thing and initially this is astoundingly overwhelming the creators have done themselves no favours at all releasing at this stage the game while polished at least in what little is available is pretty bare bones in content a very poor tutorial that literally says it is in depth and teaches you everything you need to know about the game actually teaches you next to nothing and then a handful of scenario maps which basically stick you in a sandbox mode coupled with some very odd mini game things

that said you really have to give this game time a couple of days at least because you will really find yourself struggling to understand what the hell you need to do but after some trial and error and restarts because nothing you do is reversiblethings will start to make sense a lot of people are complaining about the price i cant say i entirely agree its 20 for something thats been in development for 3 years the artwork is pretty damn unique and as i said before beautiful if you dont think 3 years of a teams time is worth 20 then your delusional

i do however hope that much more content follows quickly and much better updates to the ui to fix the wild stab in the dark approach you have to take currently
you get the feeling at times the developers were being different for the sake of being different but i do think it has amazing potential if they take the criticisms as constructive and adapt

#####

this game really helps me think about something else and keeps me busy since im having quite a tough time recently

its kinda hard to get into at first but since ive been keeping an eye on it before the release i was able to watch some gameplay and study the mechanics

thank you for helping me having decent true fun in a cruel world

#####

great strategy simulation game thatll have you drawing many similarities to rimworld

very enjoyable and definitely fun in this early access state with the devs making many daily updates to the game

major differences
 less emphasis on setting priorities characters will have passions and gather on their own without instruction
 characters will gain experience that increases their primary stats and worktime activities gives them path points pp with every 100 pp allowing you to level up and choose personalities passive buffs stat increases or passions gatheringcrafting abilities these personalities and passions on each level are random and no two settlers will have the same options when you level them
 larger focus on an ageing mechanic buffs and debuffs depending on whether youre a baby child adult elder
 create 4 character parties that can scout the map attack enemies and pickup loot 
 the ability to transfer gearloot instantly instead of requiring the character to go to a stockpile

#####

really fun game the biggest strenght is probably the originality and how it actually innovates with new gameplay ideas the game is not for everyone as most good games are the micromanagement gets tedious and there are a lot of things you need to keep in mind but in the end it is all worth it as tfm delivers an unmatched colony builder and rpg experience in one package

#####

i would say how it is right now no there are a lot of bugs your people can get stuck on buildings and starve to death or fighters get stuck on loops where enemy points are in the walls i had fun playing and will keep checking in on it but it became very frustrating when i had to just stop a play through because all my people were either starving to death or not able to progress

#####

reminds me of the old culture games really glad someone brought that style back im enjoying the experimentation with the mechanics theres even a sandbox campaign to experiment with the complex tech tree 

i would love an even higher speed up option while i wait for all the babies to grow up

if the devs go through with their current roadmap this game could be a wonderful polished diamond

#####

update nov 23
i left this game for several months and just recently comeback to see how it goes looks like its now more accessible to people since this game is now a bit simpler honestly i like the previous direction of the game which is complicated for most people but if this for the good of this game to reach more people i guess ill support and as promised i nominate this game for labour of love in this year award i know this game would not win since there are more popular game out there but i hope this can encourage the dev a bit to always update this game to stand out in colony sim genre


if the dev always constantly update this game weekly ill definitely choose it in next labour of love category steam award theres always change to be better every week i play this game

#####

 as for me it is important how we perceive a game and im sure alot ppl will try to compare this game with rimworld for me rimworld is something like harrison deathworld where you trying to save your life at any cost tfm is more looks like tolkien hobbit peacefull village where after some developt you set small party of 4 brave hobbits for the journey

 things i like
visual part of the game is really great different biomes awesome animals alot monsters and music good all of this gives really warm feelings
developing characters alot perks early game getting some top tier perk gives wow effect alot different items for adventurers
overall developing village alot buildinsjobs alot items crafts resourses i like traditions and adaptationshope for more new with time this things make loosing elders due old age not such a critical
roadmap  looks promising

 thing i dont like or need to be fixed changed
speed of game really infat to child 1 year child to adult 1year path points for lvling 1015 after 45lvls all jobs 2030 take time adaptations after first 1 or 2 something like 2030 the game flowing to sloo i complete memoria campaing in first time just strarting mining cooper all take to long times
optimization the game looks great untill you get about 50 settlers even opening craft menu gives a lagg and devs anonce removing craft menu from settlers why  this was only 1 way to avoid lagg with opening 1000 item list
better and clear tooltips and information things not such bad how alot ppl complain but for sure need to be done better more filters in crat menu
better settlers automation and settings for this i hope someday its will be possible to autotake essences and hunters will possible to carry multiitems
roadmap  again i like it but its sad that devs prioritizing skirmish and not random dunno who is interested in 4v4 settlers battles with rng perks for the same reason i dont like they spend alot time for custom the game positioning more like colony sim not minigames or i mistaken and steam gives wrong tags for now its only 3 interesting campaing with mostly the same progressionand due to slow village develope its not such great playing them 1 by 1 after you finish them  end of the story no random no global map or something like this

at the end i wanna say the game is cool and cozy and i want to belive in devs and planned roadmap

#####

tldr if you wouldnt play rimworld without your favorite mods  hold off on buying

there are some interesting design choices at play here but nothing that instantly sinks the game yet also nothing that makes this seem like it will be a standout title a few years from now like rimworld  at least not yet as rimworld initially didnt seem like it would become what it did until the modding community took off with it

i have to call out one thing right off the bat  of all the design choices that it seems many developers are making these days that are easy to avoid being unable to rebind keys in a game should be considered a cardinal sin  really it doesnt take a lot of resources to code this but many devs put it off thinking ill just add it in later as it really isnt a big deal  never thinking that there are people out there that perhaps ucantu play or prefer not to play the way ithe devs doi  its becoming a bit silly with this because you know people clamor for this on discord and the devs are like well add it before release  how about add it right as development begins

i was intending on keeping this short as im still learning about the game but ive already missed that boat

the art style is going to be hit or miss for most but i did find it interesting that some art assets have a idont starvei look to them  then theres the ui not a fan all of the colors undecided that represent different thingsconcepts and the individual components that make up the game  while i havent dug into the stockpile system too much it seems bleh on first pass  similarly while out on an expedition and opening up things like barrels and chests there is very little feedback  sometimes you see one of those colors and an icon pop up and sometimes nothing so you dont know if it was empty if you looted it or what

at this point even though i havent hit the two hour mark ill probably keep the game as it is interesting but my suggestion for most is to be patient and see how it progresses from here  theres a game here theres potential for a good game even perhaps a great game with modding  but if you have doubts about spending 25 or you wouldnt play rimworld without your favorite mods then hold off for now

gah  wheres my maybe button

#####

i wanted to wait a little more to put my hands on this gem because i felt it needed more qol updates with the ea release there is an amazing structure and flow in the game and it hooks me to the screen in a very scary way maybe it is me but since it was unique and nothing to copypasta devs didnt figure out well how mechanics can communicate with an average player like me now it seems like almost every ui element improved and tells me what is going on more with meaning way i mean how can you release a game without an alert system seriously good thing it is in the game right now and helping me a lot to overcome the pressure

considering it has been around 40 days since the release their development power looks promising i have been in the discord server for a while and communication with the community is also good i believe this game will be one of those must play in 67 months not because of qol updates but also content and more will be flowing hopefully check out their roadmap crazy stuff if they can deliver

a few recommendations to devs please add abilities to summon enemies to our village with a riskreward concept for some reason i dont feel like exploring outer worlds that much but i still want to take that combat challenge in my village with my own will that reminded me of risk of rains ritual events where players can summon elites to make more income yes there is a map with waves of enemies incoming but i want more with my own control on top of that

i am struggling while sending crafts and consumables to my villagers because i have to inspect characters before sending an item maybe add a focus button to the player portrait the character panel looks quite busy but if can manage consider adding currently equipped items maybe switching with the trait column to reduce the noise

good luck looking forward to weekly updates 3

#####

tutorial play through review

let me start out by saying that this is a great game thats vibrant and beautiful but i have a lot comments for improvements from my first play through since its lacking in a lot of ui aspects that should be reducing the clicks to goal

need a better ui i dont want to keep clicking to open things just to see my resources all the time i merely want to glance over to see my resources or progress

display at top left the major resources for buildings and separate them into tiers for basic and processed the current ui is too basic there needs to be one more level of separation to display the building resources and food resources for building production and assignment

raw meat vegetables and cook food should be separate while cooked food should be consolidated into the top left display

please display in a bar style the building type and name we dont need the descriptions we can look it up if we need to in a help section or something maybe a dont starve style ui

there should be a building queue and resources required to make it

please show a building limit for how many people should occupy a limit like 12 or 32 for under and over limits this isnt a cap but shows the optimal amount of people for a building assignment

there should be auto level pathing option for non adventurers since once communities get to a certain size it becomes unmanageable the only time this would be a problem would be for the nursery when selecting babies

for the auto pathing the resources generated should be shown on the resource page so that we can place or use later

need to allow us to move community members wherever we like we want to be able to perform unique maneuvers because it seems drafting is only for adventurers

the mob interactions need to be fixed they should switch targets to the closest adventurer if the adventurer gets far enough away not chase them down while getting hit by other adventurers

we need to be able to create buildings or designate areas to perform certain actions such as eating it seems odd that the community members get their food and eat wherever without the ability to designate a location or create a communal eating building

we need a progress bar for production tasks to know when tasks or assignments are almost done seems odd that we cant see anything but have to wait for who knows how long

havent gotten the unity soul or tech or anything but is there an achievement or progress bar for anything i dont understand what it does

maybe for later but we need events that force the need for community members such as monster invasions food droughts resource collapse or creates recognition for these community members hopefully down the line we can get a title assignment for recognition of community members

closing comments
this game requires a lot of time to build up the communities developers need to reduce the user input to a minimum this seems to be an adventurer heavy game maybe add in other aspects such as trading and item production so that exotic resources can come to the community and masterpieces can be created by craftsmen i felt the lack of community destruction in this game it was too safe and vanilla the base building needs setbacks feels like there should be a 2 steps forward 1 step back approach for the base building to get the player involved

#####

the game requires some patience to learn but its definitely worth it getting past the initialization its a unique colony sim  rpg mixture i really liked the ai and different passionprofession paths changing the behaviors of sims 

dont expect rimworld controls or a game like settlers tfm creates its own subgenre 

as maps feel like one time challenges i would like to see a bigger campaign or more mission maps in the future definitely

#####

id have to agree with the con posted by most people  the game is not friendly to new players  so much so that you need to be a masochist mentally to want to figure everything out on your own  

i can be that type mentally for some games just couldnt do it for this game  if you dont mind just clicking random buttons and seeing what works and doesnt work over and over to learn the game because youre only getting a very basic tidbit in the tutorial

#####

if the game appeals to you visually and conceptually youll like it be prepared though to save a lot cause theres still a bunch of bugs that pop up every now and then which require you to load your last save currently theres 3 campaign maps which take some time to finish also theres 4 scenarios which dont follow the normal games rules the game needs a lot of tweaking but a lot of what needs tweaking is mentioned in the roadmap so all in all give the game a go if you dont mind a true ea game state dont get it if youll complain about missing stuff thats planned

edit ive been following the weekly updates and a lot of the stuff has been addressed havent played again yet but i like how its going definitely a good job by the devs

#####

very confusing ui plus totorial is a bit bugged
game maybe is ok but so far its difficult from tech perspective
also its hard to understand the needs  statuses of each colonist not sure even if they have hunger stat or anything

anyway its bit strange game i will wish list it once again but right now its in too early stage

#####

although some parts of the game are still clunky i think their is a lot of potential here the current systems in the game are quite complex with a lot of replay value from save to save the devs frequently update the game and do their best to listen to feedback on discord as long as this continues i think many issues that others have brought up will be addressed im having a lot of fun myself atm but i am also fairly easy to please if anything changes in the future with development i will change this review accordingly

while i give a positive review here i do not recommend to buy the game in its current state there is not much content right now 1 sandbox map 1 tower defense map a tutorial and demo map and its still messy by messy i mean that development is still ongoing very noticeably the game does not look like it has reached its final form yet the main menu will greet you with most buttons still greyed out for example

what you can do on the defense map train a bunch of adventurers build up your little settlement trade when you are strong enough defeat the big bad guy or so havent actually gotten there yet you manage your villagers individually by giving them new traits all the time  whenever they level up after doing a few tasks traits are semirandomized and determine which job a villager performs you can only control adventurers directly all the other villagers are more or less autonomous you must also watch out for their needs by giving them relaxation items or downtime activities that they may perform if one of their energy levels reaches zero they will perish and you are responsible for managing the population reproduction new babies as there is an age stat it would appear that villagers will also die eventually or at least suffer from stat penalties at old age

city building  check
adventure  check
rpg elements  check
snacks  check

time to sit back and play the game i have been in testing for a few months finally a few days off in a row i can try get another 120 suns old age warrior hes got not damn teeth but his sword arm is as strong as well hes still swinging ok

yes this game has a brutal learning curve hell i have played the test for a good 100 hours but you know what at some point it just clicks and all that shouting and micro managing just seems to vanish into nothing as you battle with yourself to remember what goes with what and how to improve your city then adventures into the unknown for glory

also guys when are you gonna take my advances to be your voice actor for the mission quests serious i would love to p

the devs have worked their socks off talking and taking feed back from the testers and improving on what i think is a super city builder adventure game im here to support anyway i can and will at some point have more time to play and keep giving feed back these guys listen to their players and fix issues or improve i think the folks giving bad reviews need to just relax and keep trying to understand this game its defo a hard one to master i just cant get away from the art style

anyways love the game keep on improving guys i know it can only get better 

#####

fun game to micro and minmax it takes a bit of time to understand the gaming mechanics but it is super fun to play after that

#####

upd a lot of updates and game is constantly evolving i like the work devs put into it

2 hrs review 
very good and engaging game
i would really advice developers to create a demo containing for example tutorial mission because you will fall in love with the artstyle and general love that has been put into this game
despite being early access it gives tons of stuff already to do and you can become pretty frustrated if you dont like management games

#####

a huge game i hope the developers continue commited to this project the game has so much potential

#####

i really enjoy the art style but thats about it for now at least i dont understand why sop many people are comparing this to rimworld as there are very few similarities which is fine but theres not much for the player to actually do id compare it closer to majesty but even then the game isnt there yet i felt i was just watching the whole time and occasionally clicking something to level up a pawn tfm might make a decent  idle mobile game and maybe i just dont get it but for the price id recommend passing on this one for now at least

#####

tfm is unusual unique piece with great artistic touch and deepdetailed game flow visuals and sounds fits well together with the ambiance it is colorful and rich crafted by talented developer so many details everywhere it is like a complete painting at some point and i didnt even see the whole existing content yet but i watched lots of videos from content creators

so yeah probably it is not the gameplay you are used to but if you are up to something new this should be what you are looking for

at the begining you have to read many information especially traits you are applying to individuals

managing individuals since they are infant until elderunless they die to some other conflict is what sells it to me but i am also working on improving collective behaviors increasing their life quality as they serve to village better as an outcome preparing party and explore the world bringing back the loot is great loop

game needs bigger maps i am assuming will be added in future you should definitely check the roadmap 

daynight cycle will change the games ambiance and gameplay a lot 

this indie product has massive area to improve as content and feature wise hopefully devs can afford working on it until it reaches to full potential and on top of that if they can manage adding coop  multiplayer this might one of the best game that can take a year or two or 3 who knows all i want is playing such game with my friends before i close my gaming scene

i was stalking developers discord they are really good at listening feedback and applying what is essential you can literally ask them anything at least you were before release

also i am huge settlers and km fan you better make those roads functional asap

#####

been playtesting this game for quite a while i enjoyed it due to how unique it is its so rare to play a new kind of game something that deviates from the more general genres of gaming it is however threading on new ground and explaining the game is hard not only in a review but also in the game itself the tutorial might not be covering whats needed the ui will give you a challenge at first

with being in playtesting i can say that the developers are very active and quick to look at player feedback and implementing them in the game although now the game is in ea implementing might be slower so i expect rapid improvements now that the floodgates of feedback is coming in

if you are into learning and discovering new systems in a game if you want to find something that isnt a copy of other generic settlement games i would recommend tfm

#####

i really dont understand how this game doesnt get better reviews 70  thats way below from what it deserves every one wants another rimworld clone while they should want something new and different as wellp 
very nice game the mechanics are very good altough very different from what we re used to i like that the game uses passions rather than chores and your people are more alive than just being robots doing the same stuff over and over again you need to spend time to flesh out your characters and give them traits and then watch your village evolvethe artwork is just fantastic i am really exited to see where the development of this game will lead us 
very nicely done keep up the good work developers

#####

the game is really immersive i felt like i was really there and tried to establish the first human tribe  since i know that the producers are turkish it was more exciting for me  even though it was early access it is very successful even in this form i think we should be supportive i believe they will improve even more with our support 

congratulations

#####

this game is sticky as hell i just got roasted by my wife after playing it for over an hour  she wants to go out   ill continue playing it tomorrow there is a bit of a learning curve as it has a complex game mechanic but i strongly recommend it to whom enjoy creating

#####

at this state no for this pricetag bigger no

so ive been playin almost any genre for 15 years now but i got lost in this game after 15 hrs i still had no idea how this game works maybe it was because of bugs maybe it was because im dumb af i doubt that i even played the tutorial kind of got lost there aswell maybe because i had to leave and saved and loaded back in later
i read the overview ingame wiki  still no clue

1 very unintuitive
2 translations arent finished at all
3 maybe bugs i cant even tell if this game has bugs or if i just didnt understand it for example i wanted to build sth but i couldnti closed the window openend it again and suddenly i could build something
4 its too early to publish for this price tag
5 i dunno i have never been so lost in a game ngl

#####

this game giwe me lost feeling about discowerie what we got in the past when games did not hawe rewievs on dif platformssome argue about not understanding how to get things for me thats a plus because i do not want to see a plan on how to get something i want to dicower myselfi play so much at the moment and keep open new properties and other things skills and passions are so deep and open many new thingsif you like understood all things from the beginning this game is not for you here you develop your story and story is different every timefor me this game reminds in some ways a dwarf fortress and its great pluss

#####

keep in mind this review is from 11182022 will update it as things progress  this game is early access to please dont take my words personally  i encourage you to playtest on your own

this game looks visually wonderful and i find the art style charming  for me it played a bit like a setitandforgetit rimworld where i am mostly sitting back and doing not a whole lot while i level up my characters from time to time  instead of workbenches like rimworld you build preexisting structures  this made me unable to feel like i was really basebuilding instead just plopping down interactable props whose size and scale i had no control over  you can build walls paths etc but beyond that you will just be thumping down prefab everything  maybe some like this but i dont care for it wasnt really able to get into that aspect of the game and didnt care too much about my base since my control over its design was limited

i enjoyed watching my tribes ai and following their tasks  for the most part they seem to take care of themselves well enough that i didnt need to intervene much at all  there were a few times i had to draft people to get them out of spots they became trapped in but other than that it was fairly smooth  the equipment system is really strange where anything you equip gets destroyed if you remove it and nobody else can use it either  it was obtuse finding out that the person i instructed to make a weapon didnt just have it in their inventory but that the weapon they created went to the colonys massive inventory where i had to click it from there and assign it to said colonist  

i would say as far as now the game feels like it takes elements of the rts genre buildings are prefab and rimworld the colonists and their needs and combines them with majesty ai that mostly goes off doing their own things  im unable to select neutral as a recommendation so i am choosing yes to recommend this game  definitely keep your eyes on it if you are a fan of colony sims although keep in mind the base building is just placing prefabs

#####

the game is extremely buggy to the level of being unplayable sometimes bugs corrupt your save game and when that happens say bye bye to your wasted hours because there is no going back 

#####

gameplay feels way too boring after first few hours

progression and people skill micromanagement is overcomplicated and tedous yet slow and not really rewarding

your people does not feel human more like dumb bots doing same chores time and time again

#####

ive been waiting to play the game for more than 2 years so im amazed by their passion towards the game 

at first glance ui may look hard to you but you can have a grasp of the game right after the tutorials they are quite selfexplanatory after 15 min tutorials for understanding everything in the game

#####

decided to check progress of game it completly lost it original desing from demo version and become blant as lot of others game copies of colony sims they probably want make game easy to enter in exchange for identity so i suggest just pass it you wont lose anything interesting

#####

you love majesty but you wish you want a bit more control then this game is for you there are no ui problems the majority of the stuff is intuitive just keep in mind that you have to be picky with passions and traits to avoid your citizens stuck without job orders because they love everything and thus do nothing

thought gonna play for an hour already spent 3 and gonna spend even more

i would recommend to make the game a bit more hardcore as well with more enemies and random encounters

#####

absolutely loved the art and initial story for this game its in ea so obviously needs a bit more work but its a game ill keep coming back to and follow

#####

what a fun and innovative twist to a city builder haha i dont know much about turkish folklores but love me some dark fairy tales haha the learning curve is a bit steep and the tutorial could use a bit more of a description as to what roles things like heart soul and self actually apply to uhm only other thing is it becomes a bit clicky with the upgrades once your settlement gets large mabye could do with an automated path like this persons a woodcutter it now automates things along the path that will help in woodcutting and instead of the item being from clicking the upgrade just throw it in the rewards build section would be nice to be able to also stockpile the reward builds from leveling up gives more wiggle room to plan where you want things to go but the adventuring part of the game brings back some serious heroes of might and magic vibes d it could also use a bit of refining in the sense that its very very hard to escape a battle if your already committed to it id actually be stoked to see a more tactical ff7 battle system where can pick and choose attacks at leisure like a battle start then boom into a kind of jrpg style combat it gets hard to land attacks on multiple opponents in real time but im old school so take that with a grain of salt haha over and all with the updates they have already done and the roadmap for what they plan to do keep an eye on this one if you want a quarky little twist to what your normally used to i see myself getting many many hours deep into this one d

#####

there is a lot going on here and micro management is almost unbareable i have already played it 2530 hours and i would say that justifies the pricetag i am very much enjoying my self but there are times of frustration

#####

ui is very bad but thats it for me the idea behind the game is great it has any other colony sims essence and a greater character development system  we will see if it lives up to its potential

#####

while the price is a bit on the high end the game is rather fun and do i look forward to it being finished

#####

its an interesting game with interesting mechanics sadly its let down by being extremely buggybroken ive yet to be able to finish a single game without some kind of major bug making my playthrough completely unenjoyable for example settlers becoming stuckfrozen on a task forever 

they seem to be working quite a lot on the title with frequent patches but i still cant recommend putting down money for the game right now maybe put on watch list

#####

i have read the down vote reviews and i understand the problems they have had with understanding the basic functionality of the game  it has taken me 2 or 3 failed senarios to figure out how to use items from the tree inventory and how to play to the strengths of your citizens but even my failed play throughs have been fun  i highly recommend this game to anyone who would love to play dnd mixed with a city builder like banished  that is the best way i can descirbe this game

#####

alright as i had hoped the updates that they have regularly been putting out have been going great and its been a massive improvement since before
the character stats still largely feel meaningless with the only ones of any note on my traits are movement speed and whatever additional resource activities grant but since the stats now influence what type of traits will also pop up theres a chance that it actually does something in the future
the ais been substantially improved though largely because we stopped having to rely on the ai for literally everything and now manually assign tasks

it is still hard to tell if some jobs are actually getting done by multiple people at a time with one building or not some like the cook pit will kick the previous worker off if you assign another and yet others like the nursery appears to switch out the workers on a rotation i couldnt honestly tell

also you really want to have each character only doing one or two jobs because the scrolling function on the job doesnt really work and rubberband boxing still doesnt really work and the combat controls are obnoxious where its simultaneously only directly controlling one character but all of the drafted character regardless of weapons or range all move around the enemy if you click on it

#####

a hidden gem  its a combination of heroes of might and magic rimworld and sims honestly give it a chanceit starts off real slow and fairly easy to pick up the and lore is unique the one thing id like to see added is some defense building the raids can get rough and defensive buildings would helpoh yeah the updates are constant props to the devs

#####

beta tester with 300 hours in the game huge fan sort of a combination of rimworld and magesty with a lot of extra twists thrown in very much a just till this happens and then its deep into the morning hours type of game

a response to the naysayers
tfm is a meaty game that doesnt hold your hand it does need an advanced tutorial and my understanding is that work on the ui to ease understanding are high on the priority list

that said i firmly believe that those that either watch some videos or persevere with some trial and error through that initial learning curve will be greatly rewarded

update

i stepped away for a while after things were heading in a way i personally didnt like  tried it again with the latest update and go no longer recommend this significantly dumbed down game many of the mechanism that made the game unique and interesting are gone or changed to a pale version of what they once were

maybe those that thought it was too complicated might give it a try again but im out


#####

not quite as polished as i wish it was lategame gets very crowded with both crafting options and characters to manage but which management game isnt and they already took some steps to make the ui better through patches its certainly not similar to other games i know and the party exploration system isnt the most elegant solution in my opinion but its a fun game with a lot of untapped potential an enjoyable take on a highfantasy management game with a unique progression tree

#####

this game is great  tutorial is great to get you started plus there is a search function to find any information you may need  youtube videos for more in depth content  if you like rimworld or necesse type games youll enjoy this one 

like most of the games in this type of genre its going to take a couple hours before you are comfortble with all the uifunctions but once you are the game really shines

#####

if you play rimworld you know these games have an impossible to understand ui xd
but you learn the ropes its suffering then its great

now im sad game still not 10 i want to forget it exist and comeback in 2024

amazing potential and the multiplayer option that is not enabled yet makes me dream of this game  

go on devs hope you make a lot of money in early access

#####

has many unique game mechanics and the art style really sells it one of the most visually pleasing games to play

#####

watching your people doing different things with awesome music is very relaxing character specs differentiation is wonderful it makes every character quite unique i recommend it to everyone

#####

shes got a lot of soul but certainly rough around the edges  i bought and have no regrets  look forward to where this goes and want to make sure the developers understand hey youve got something here  

the character evolution is top notch  there is a lot of depth here  everyone is complaining about lack of a tech tree  life doesnt have a tech tree folks  however it does have a progression where you learn to grow wheat before very particular herbs mine copper before youve learned to make steel  your knowledge base stays in your settlement  you can have that steel maker teach a 15 year old how to smelt unless he dies first and takes that knowledge with him  yes there is some rng in the character evolution  i would say it gives characters flavor rather than all being the same blank canvas at birth

i will criticize the current state of the party system a bit  there needs to be a tech to expand it slowly  perhaps a second party would start as a single scout and could grow slowly  there also need to be a lot more scenarios soon

there is a published roadmap and i look forward to seeing this diamond in the rough get polished

update 1 year later same as above holds true  however there is a lingering saved game corruption issue  as i recall it led me to rage quit last year and i just sunk 6 hours only so see it is still an issue  there is nothing more frustrating than loading a save and it being like oops you broke the game  tell us about it  all your characters are frozen in place rendering the game unplayable  

save yourself the frustration and do not buy until the developer clearly says they have addressed this issue

#####

this is fascinating indepth colony sim based on the principle of interdependent character specialisms its a deep and compelling departure from your more obvious dwarf fortressrimworld clones where every citizen can pretty much do everything
puzzling out what infrastructure and character specialisms you need in order to progress to a more sophisticated crop or manufacturing process is enough to keep me busy endlessly even without focusing on combat only just getting into the belief mechanics and its blowing my mind

honestly could not recommend more to fans of the genre even at this stage of development a few puzzling mechanics and some micromanagement that im trying to navigate but otherwise its an utter joy from art style to gameplay progression

#####

complex but fun game very pretty art style and innovative gameplay

#####

early access first impressions

the first hour was baffling the tutorial can only explain so much of what is a very different style of game to most 

i notice some reviewers have opted for the cry like a baby instead of actually trying to learn a game because the mechanics arent copy pasta from the last 100 games they played which looked similar on the box
if you have an ounce of adventure and enjoy character stats god games and general strategy then you should probably just ignore the naysayers and crack on

if you find yourself struggling get on the discord and onto the yt guides people have made even a short 510 minute video explanation can help ease you into this unique game
its got a few rough edges it is early access after all though after a little back and forth with the devs on their discord it is clear that they have a lot of plans already in place and they seem like a clever bunch so i am not sweating it

price           seems fair when considering what the finished product will offer
concept    very unique and refreshing a proper god game in many ways
visuals       pretty quirky seemed a little cluttered at first but your eyes adjust quickly to 
                       what you are seeing hopefully they implement colour impaired options as the 
                       game is very reliant on colour systems for ease of play 
gameplay  there is a bit of learning required initially with a strong emphasis on choosing 
                       your villagers stats as they progress ensuring you level up and pass on skills 
                       to the future generations is an essential skill which will take bit of mastery the 
                       menus can be a little cluttered until you learn to use the filter options but this is 
                       also being worked on by the devs based on community feedback


tldr  its very cool very unique and very clever if you arent those things then just scroll past xd

#####

my society story everything was going fine then everyone died because they didnt have a bonfire to sit at 

some bullet point complaints
2 hours of play and the only thing i had to show for it was 6 houses and a few roads
automation seems broken people will just work themselves to death 
the games tutorial hardly goes into the deep depths this game has to offer leaving you feeling confused
complex to the point of being obtuse and unfun 
how the heck do you fulfill red needs

absolutely unfinished absolutely confusing

update they seem to be updating many of my issues out of the game the dev team is active and i may have been rash with my first impressions my complaints stand but they have been addressed on further reading

i totally missed the hunter in my first play through while it was probably mentioned in the tutorial i didnt exactly catch on to the whole build aspect of my civ ill give it another go

#####

great game still under development and looking very promising there is at the moment some missing features but most of them are scheduled to be released in later updates 
i would definitely recommend this game if you like strategy  survival game with management

#####

this is an unique game with unique mechanics that being said there are many issues of polishing that need to be addressed my main concern is that new craftables are not marked therefore you have to search the list to find new additions this is not only items as buildings are also on the same list this may seem like a small nuisance but it has turned playing the game into a chore of checking lists all the time to spot a new item in there simple feature that is missing the developers said that a qol update is in the pipeline so i will update this review when that is done

#####

i bought this game at version ea 065

this game is a slowpace colony sim with a lot of micromanagement and rng game
and require a lot of trial and error learn about game mechanic

mostly i have to manage crafting building selecting jobskillbehavior etc manually
ai units are quite annoying and stupid at current stage they call for some gears but they dont craft it by themselves 
i have to command them to craft to deliver and to equip it pretty boredom and nonsense

pray rng god when unit is level up and unit born because the game will random main element and behavior

personally i like this game and recommend it to people whose love complex colony sim game

#####

amazing game
keeps updating every week with new content and fixes
a great city buildingmanagementrpg games and a fresh new take on currency management
deserves every penny

#####

finally

#####

interesting story world building and variety in game design  

overall tfm has a great potential i hope devs will bring the game to its potential with hard work and steady updates


#####

killed my first character from punching a training dummy to death him not the training dummy

#####

played about 30 hours during the closed test phase and have to say this game makes progress fast its obviously not completed being released in early access but it already is worth tryng out at least

#####

h1 an awesome 4x rts h1
disclaimer i was a playtester for this game and help find bugs for the devs to fix and remove those bugs

anyway this game is really fun it got the speed of a rts but strategy of a colony simulator there are 5 statsresources you worry about but its very intuitive and easy to understand the combat is interesting and intense finally there are great signs that this game was a labor of love and confidence the devs really communicate with their fanbase and both sides got what they want a good strategy game with magic the gathering knights and merchant and warcraft elements

#####

game has a great concept however the current implementation has its share of problems

it has a lot of complexity which is not necessarily bad by itself and a very clunky interface which leaves most of the micromanagement in the hands of the player that is a big nono for me also i found pathfinding to be quite problematic graphics are ok and adequate for this style of game

i cannot recommend this game in its current state at the current price tag however it is worth keeping an eye on if the devs are able to develop it into a more polished experience this has the potential to become a hidden gem

#####

i do not write reviews until now

price does not match product game is workable but there are game breaking mechanics with little tutorial 

wait for a sale  dont buy in current state unless you are fully into supporting developer and working bugs out

game is worth 12 of sale price currently

#####

save a lot game crush dont save when you camp

#####

first game in a long time where i gave up before even finishing the tutorial 

the amount of information that is shoved at you loads of things you are expected to keep track of with an unhelpful ui for the task perhaps ive been spoiled by other games but im not interested in constantly babysitting and micro managing to such an extreme extent

#####

i genuinely couldnt grasp all the negative feedback its essential to remember that the game is still in early access it has immense potential and is quite enjoyable to play

#####

yeah

#####

theses beans need to bake longer

#####

to start im not a huge colony builder fan  ive played some banished but thats about it  so my knowledge of the game genre is very limited

that being said this game gets weekly updates the team in discord and the community in discord are both extremely helpful and want feedback  both positive and negative  they ask for us to blast them with things we see as opportunities and they actually respond and work on it  the road map goes into 2024 theyve admitted it wont all be there until then

a lot of the negative reviews have actually already been addressed in game theyve made so many adjustments  it takes a bit to move things around and get a full understanding on what does what but every recent update has been with more tutorial help so again the devs are listening

now my one con to the game i got it on sale for i think 1999 might have been 1799 i dont fully remember  i do feel the 2499 price for a game that is still only about 14 done and in dev is a bit steep imo but i also understand that this is a small force of devs so were investing in them as they try to have a life with bills to pay too  

at the end id say the game has potential to be one that you get lost in and then the wife comes down asking what time you got up and your reply is a few hours ago  not that you didnt go to bed at all

#####

h1 tldrh1 
the game requires at least six months more for ea release imo and another 6 to be fully fun for everyone who plays dont let those negative reviews scare you as i mainly noticed they include localization issues from eastern countriesi did some google translate and price comparisons from those who have no idea what ea means and support developer ability of it if you want to support devs and be an early bird of this gem i recommend going ahead if you can afford it if you dont want to support devs dont buy or refund immediately and dont pull devs down by steams sale algorithm if you believe in the project because it just kills the project in the eye of the gaben let them gather people capable of giving positive feedback to help shape the game for the rest of the gaming community who loves the genre if you are familiar with the development timeline of rimworldwith massive respect to our lord tynan you will know what i mean

h1btfm 910bh1

my first impression is that the games world and characters are pretty different compared to what i saw in their concept trailer published maybe four years ago you can look for it on youtube if you wish from their youtube pagegatheringtree i watched one video with actual gameplay from gamerzakh if i remember correctly it had cardbased combat and a different structure with a similar ambiance i cant believe they scrapped that prototype and started over with a realtime version that takes some balls if you ask me or they are pretty funded or lack some cable inside their brains i also joined their discord after the prototype and now checked recently again when i saw the ingame discord button yesterday i noticed they have new developers in their team and the discord channel is quite active as it is more extensive and devs are just working like a bee programmers ask to save games from players to fix issues and track ingame report systems solo art guys keep showing visuals and looking for feedback game designers are nonstop trying to help with issues and gathering feedback you should join it is like their games mini version in discord hahasorry devs oh and props to veteran members they keep helping around anyway let me get down to the pillars of the game but i have to state i review the potential on top of the current state as we are buying an early access game not the final product

h1bvisuals  9 fantasticbh1
the detail in the characters constructions and environment is crazy i am a fan of those cartoonish oldschool vibes but sprite animations on fx characters with impressions buildings with interaction point animations working with figures alone made me think what i paid is stealing their money at some point the community can also contribute to such art style once they provide tools ive seen much better 2d game art but kept my ten scores to disco elysium monkey islands knightsmerchants  so yeah i would say tfm is dont starves level to me characters can enter to 2d constructions

h1bsound  9 good jobbh1
ive seen soundtracks in games hans zimmer levels such as gothic diablo kenshi or wow so i spare my 10 for those games but this game also has a unique taste often eastern vibes but middleeast more lets put it in an oriental way which is a fresh take always i am happy they are not into medieval in a concept with adameve the sound is spoton and supports visuals when you click on any construction they have its sound activities combat etc but there is no sound on characters maybe it will kill immersion without unique engineering touch and converts characters to generic that is why i wish they could craft a voice system that works with character seed and makes up premade sound with fake language it can increase the immersion and character feeling significantly in my opinion and with the help of engineering each individual can have a unique voice ive seen some experiments about that but what do i know

h1bgameplay  9 unique bh1
the main reason i gave 9 is they are trying to achieve gameplay i didnt experience in my 25 years of active gaming i am sure it exists somewhere i didnt play because humankind can only improve what they have seen before so far mix of settlers village management rimwrolds character progression wc3s world exploration and inventory system and pillars combat system comes to my mind speaking of wc3 the custom maps they added are a little showoff so theyor anyone in the future can craft any stupid idea and share it with the community

this games main flow is based on traits and how they modify themselves or othersboth out of the village or inside you start with adding passion like a caveman and it starts evolving with path point accumulation improving passions and unlocking new ones for generations it seems like a bottomless pit which is the selling point of that game imagining the community involved in this traitstorm is scaring me i am looking for reasons and what it will be in the future not what it is right now and it leads me to support devs as i believe the colony sim genre is in need of this game

h1bui  6 promisingbh1
i believe devs know how unintuitive the ui is based on connecting pieces to the new players especially those who liked the art and wanted to play this unique gem but the game is constantly evolving and no one wants to release the game even to ea with that kind of ui but who knows maybe they are out of money in the middle development considering they have been developing for years i know devs from turkey which is an unfortunate countrybeautiful country 3 when it comes to game development as far as i know with a player baseweak support to such products or art human resourcethe only company i know is bannerlords taleworld and economyi know kickstarter and paypal are not working for example but no one cares about those reasons as a customer and doesnt need to see a single of them and it disconnects the newcomers if you make garbage ui old habits take over and a player is frustrated  altf4  negative review simple as that and it doesnt matter from which country if you make  of 99 localization you get rekt i saw a person complaining about characters not moving because the game is in pause mode in the discord screenshot not insulting anyone but this game is at rubiks cubesolving level with almost to many players

h1bcontent  9 enough for now but i need morebh1
it is rich i keep seeing new stuff even though the maps are small to my taste because the game generates content even in a remote location there is a chill map a combatheavy map and a map in between it is hard to tell right now but i am satisfied with what ive seen assuming i can spare 6070hours in my current state but in 6 months it can be 200300hours and grows exponentially as variations grow to feed every run once their mapmaker tools are unlocked to players considering communities of such gameskenshi rimworld etc are mad scientists i cant even imagine what kind of content this game will hold also as it is 2d i believe generating content must be superfluid regarding new icons constructions and characters or world objects

simple they dont want those who cant afford it at this point with no discount and only those who can give feedback and support devs why would they start with no deal or lower prices for an unfinished product my only concern is that they can get through this if they are in a financial situation i feel like they are as too many games in discount right now i noticed they use steams new regional prices which is a horrible decision if you ask me it is not up to you new indie devs to test steams new ideas simple as that to me but what do i know i can only hope for the best

i love it amazing dynamics world concept and art style the world is more expanding when you play over than 45 hours

#####

update 012534   this game looks like it is turning out to be abandoned the roadmap lists a bunch for things for late 2023 and none of them have been implemented


i changed my review from a positive to a negative because this has the potential of being amazing but the current way that group combat and combat in general is designed is probably turning a lot of people off the controls and dynamics need to be overhauled completely to follow the standard rts form factor

click and drag to select multiple units press ctrl# to assign units to groupshotkeys right click with a unitgroup selected to move to a location or to engage an enemy units need formation buttons and behavior buttons ranged units need to try to stay in range they need to be able to be told to guard an area patrol an area follow a unit engage a unit within a certain area and then return when the enemy leaves etc 

if this game followed the typical controls and ideas of combat of historys great age of empires series command and conquer starcraft warcraft etc then i would be hooked as it stand combat is way too frustrating difficult and tedious to hold my attention

the rest of the game is marvelous i love the art style and the animations i love the sprites i love the scenery and buildings and how everything looks painted by hand the sounds are good honestly everything else is in pretty good condition

#####

refund requested no dice apparently international consumer law doesnt apply to steam its an rts not a city builder but its also more than that there are very large parts of the early game where you dont have anything to do except watch as animations take place the game gets progressively more complicated due to micromanagement of toons in mid to late gameits not apparent what you need to unlock buildingsprofessions and the in game help is convoluted to say the least at this point its pretty bare bones the ui is small and buildings are not easy to find id expect a lot of content to be released over the next year according to the development roadmap that is to be the case so for now its a no but i will keep an eye on the games progress as updates come out this will be updatedthe graphics are ok and the games engine seems to run pretty smoothly theres a base for a great game here                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                          
update after the last large update and two smalller ones in 2 weeks the game runs more smoothly and path progression is easier too understand and use effectively changes to the way building works mean the building tree mean its easier too naviigate also an active and responsive development team is a very good thing

#####

great game so far i cant wait to see where it goes from here

#####

different

#####

great game very unique looking forward to seeing it grow and improve through early access

#####

очень крутая игра

#####

i dont generally leave reviews but i want to support this very odd game

its an unusual game its really not like any other colony builder youve ever played or probably will ever play yes it is rough around the edges and nowhere near its finished state but 20 hours in im still hooked and will gladly burn my old save and start a fresh one as the gamechanging updates roll out

the developer is active they listen to what players want and youre in a for a unique experience i dont know about you but im tired of the same old same old

#####

demo and no ways to change view  window mode needs an endless mode or longer game play

#####

amazing game all i need now is to wait till i can add anime girl into it using workshop

#####

its a game ive been waiting for a long time the release of tfm in early access proves how important it is for developers to get feedback from players my first impression of tfm is very enjoyable i didnt understand how the time passed i would definitely recommend everyone to play

#####

definitely enjoying what is here so far it needs some work still as expected considering early access but theres alot to enjoy once you figure out the paths and what unlocks what it can be a bit complicate at first but was alot of fun once i got those things figured out ill be watching for further updates

#####

ive still a lot to learn but a very fun game so far congrats to the devs

#####

i like the game a lot my only complain is that i cant build a colony freely  i dont rlly care much about the campaign and different scenarios i am more about a sandbox scenario with random events havent played a lot so maybe i will change my opinion about that but i really dont like premade scenarios a thing which came as a shock also was that colonists do what they want  you can have a surprise that a guy with 3 jobs does what he likes most and ignores the other jobs and you cant force him to gather for example if he doesnt like it you need to assign them from the start with a job in each colour and stay on it otherwise you will not get points into that colour i discovered too late i dont have points in green colourprosperity because my dude got a berserker trait and started training ignoring cutting trees and collecting mushroomsbut what rlly hurt me was that without prosperity i could not get a salvo to make more babies so i need to restart the game probably  i will be honest here there is a lot to work on this game but i bought it to support their work i think the game is on the right track and in time will be a jewel i dont know what to say about price some will comment is not enough content and compared with other titles like rimworld it is inferior  but do not forget rimworld has like 3 dlcs already so is a very mature game and at release was also in a kinda incomplete state  but i chose to support their work and hardly wait to get the final product in the future

#####

good stuff

#####

really trying to like this game not asking to take me by the hand but i see nothing that realy explains anything besides some very useless tutorial texts 
you select paths without knowing whatever they do games of trial and error seem to fail to deliver enjoyment
i dont need to be a winner im a rimworlder used to loosing however i like to loose because i failed not because i pressed mindlessly something
it is frustrating will give it another start else it will be a refund edit soon

oh and the game is too expensive for what it delivers not even some hd def textures for close ups

#####

 the art youre either going to love it or hate it thats going to be quick to see for me i find it hard to actually see whats going on
 colours the whole game relies on colours red means one thing yellow another maroon is for a stat about 5 of the population are colorblind it feels so weird
 nothing is obvious but i am unsure if theyre purposely trying to go for a hard game or if its just ea issues to complete the tutorial you have to create timber how do you do that i think i have to just add more buildings and hope my people build it
 the trailers feel very different from what ive played it is ea though
 the description says create your own adam and eve adam and eve didnt suddenly know how to create structures axes etc nor did they escape from boats

theres a lot of great ideas here the art style however isnt for me but thats a personal thing and the accessibility is poor so for now ill refund and try it again in a year

i wish the team luck and hope its great but i was super excited about this and super bummed that i was overlooked with color issues

#####

crash every 1 minutes

#####

gud

#####

httpsyoutubeywqraxlgzmc

good game but the user interface is so difficult to play around with 

interesting world design 

has a massive learning curve

multiple game modes 

overall  710

 a good game with great potential 

#####

so i have been waiting for this game for a long time im happy to finally get my hands on it ill go over the pros and cons

cons
1 price seems way too high i mean its ok for me but i can see why other players on the fence think its too much for an indie game 
2 its confusing for first time players the stats alone arent intuitive instead of using game terms like strength intelligence speed etc you get stuff like body soul mind etc
3 little to no tutorial unless you are like who watched multiple lets plays on youtube you will be probably be lost

pros
1 can be seen as a successor to games like majesty basically the colony runs itself and  you just shape the way the characters evolve
2 more relaxed gameplay than traditional colony builders your citizens dont starve or get unhappy and they can play without your intervention they will die eventually though cuz they need the buildings you provide
3 the characters can still be manually controlled especially if you need to explore somewhere or band together and fight an enemy

overall i love this game but due to the price and complexitystrangeness of the gameplay it may not be for everyone

#####

the art style is pleasant but this game doesnt do anything terribly interesting or new for the genre

#####

this game isnt bad but its not for me i found it boring and slow

#####

can i send a beta testing resume for this game i make games in spare time lack the man power to make full games art and all that snazzy bs i have tons of questions and am super interested in how this game works already kinda of can see how youd have it built and i am super interested in this game from more than just a playing angle too

this game is tons of fun for me personally i get lost playing for hours so many paths for characters and loot to find im playing the defensive map right now and am having a blast im very into optimising every character for their jobs and making battle parties plays alot like warcraft 3 custom maps with creeping and all that just less army massing 

or like civ but more focused on the peoples traits to make the civ whole instead of the civ as a whole getting traits

cons are the battle party works really weird when my hunter is in it everyone drops what theyre doing when he hunts anything so hes out its weird and clunky till you get the hang of it but it gives me excitement i havent felt since sim city 2000 reminds me of cool old computer games that just are not around anymore cuz ea ate the companies and pooped all their games out sim city 5 yeesh played it alot but yeesh took what i could get

seems very overwhelming but starts to make sense i found battle classes very late like 9 hours in started over since then and have way better optimisation for the tribe i love it and it snot out for another year officially

#####

tldr

its way overcomplicated for how simple it is

#####

where do i start this game is pretty good if you like survival games im so proud cause the game created by turkish creators ive been waiting for this game so long and finally got it im afraid it will turn into an addiction you dont need a very good computer this is so important i think the creativity level in this game is outstanding its called a strategy game

#####

i admit the price tag is higher than id hoped but there is some meat here of a great game its not there yet obviously but im hoping it will be if you wanted your colony simulator with more roleplaying elements like stats that really matter and an ability to influence them in a fantasy setting the first men should really be on your radar 

lets hope they get the support theyll need to finish this as the game could be something special

#####

very slow development

#####

i liked this game a lot
outstanding artworks and gameplay navigating the map is particularly interesting and enjoyable

#####

it ruels

#####

meh truly just meh thats the best i can muster for this game

#####

where are the oranges i picked

#####

impregnation cream im out cowards

#####

good


#####

ive played for first time game like this very enjoyable and has a huge potential i prefer everyone who likes strategy games

#####

not there yet

#####

no thx

#####

good

its going to be pretty funny with my 1000 game time

#####

yes

#####

no 





#####

i have only just started this game but i felt the need to review it early due to its mixed reviews

i am enjoying it although i am still learning what is going on i can see the direction its going and i look
forward to seeing it develop

there are a few issues and some things i felt the game doesnt particularly explain very well like it took my 
awhile to figure out how to equip weapons and armour but its a unique little game that i am looking forward to 
playing

#####

game is fun very addicting to me

#####

one hour in and i cant wait till turkey day festivities are done so i can come back and play this some more

#####

so its not bad when i first got the game when it first came out it was a little ruff then i figured i would just leave it alone for a year and check it out later well its changed i understood what they were going for before the major update that made things seem a lil too ez hopefully they can keep progressing with this game because it still does seem decently unique

#####

interesting game would recommend for people who like city builders

#####

a nice relaxing game that isnt completely done but still very playable

okay i have only finished the tutorial map but it still seems solid

binding equipment is not permanent you can always switch it out with something else and equip that cool shield to your next defender

#####

it is fine

#####

lots of potential with this game and while there is currently still a lot of work to be done there is a roadmap and regular updates that show a steady progression  good enough for me  it will get there

#####

cool game thumbs up from me

#####

neat city builder with great rpg elements and a lot of things to explore

pathfinding and clicking things is a mess though i hope they will fix it

#####

ea review

this game mixes ideas from some very known and beloved titles such as rimworld clanfolk and bits of anno series at least for me it has is flaws and bugs but it still delivers something new in the mix you feel like you are playing something in which the devs placed a lot of work already

pro

 the animation and design of the game is beautiful but has a kind of you like it or hate it feeling
 music and sounds are very good 
 the general idea is great a first men strategy and survival experience
 some bright future ideas sandbox skirimishes etc and already some campaigns to enjoy which are not short

cons

 price  this is a personal one the price is way too step right now when you compare what you get from the experience a recommended price would have been 1520 at most 
 tutorial this is a very important one needs a lot of work still
 lots of bugs still some of theam game breaking
 needing polish in some areas

all in all if you have some coins to spare and youre willing to satisfy your colony management sim itch this is a more like welcoming entry although take into very account that the initial sales seems to not being good due to the price entry i mentioned in the cons which could transform into a very critical point in the near future when trying to develop the game further

i like this game and concept but for newbie its really confusing first few hours

it needs more automatization because after few hours of playing this game its really exhausting doing every 2min perks and in the final you are not doing anything else if you have more than 10 people in the village and you bet you will have when you start expanding and have more building i like it you can have everyone to be like you want it but after all its annoying artisans works good i like it when they dont have tasks they pick and transform some of raw materials without iddleing

in this game you can do a lot of stuff but in the end its annoying how much management you must to do with settlers 

would be nice to pick what settlers you wanna start with i dont hate that random pick you can always restart but it will be better

ill edit my comment soon i didnt try battles



#####

two thumbs up   bravo

been waiting on this game for a while its all that i expected wanted from it and then some

ive watched a few videos on youtube just basics game play and one explanation about the mechanics  the game is complicated but not that bad at all  just enough for a good challange

good job devs and youtubers

#####

i really like this game and find it enjoyable to play

i like building up new characters and managing their careers  

i also like the mythic setting of the game

there are a lot of things about the game that are currently poorly explained but i believe that will be worked out in time

overall i look forward to this games future development

#####

game is little rough in the current state but it has great potential

#####

this reminds me a lot of majesty with allencompassing attribute system applied to every action your characters take somewhat rough around the edges especially with the usability but thats why its ea right

i did watch one gameplay video beforehand so it was not hard to understand how to unlock more buildings and advance the community probably would have suffered otherwise choose especially the blue collector industry professions carefully at the start character customization and buildup are the strongest and most interesting aspects of game feels very unique and therefore recommended

#####

for people that like to minmax their characters this game is extremely addictive  im less then 15 hours into this game and i havent really explored any of the maps that much im mostly just trying rng for the best statstraits for my community  so far i have some really beefy adventurers that im focusing on  for me its worth it  i guess it all depends on what you want from your time  ive played tons of games that are way more expensive and are lacking  this game seems to have enough right now to keep me busy  810 so far  score may change depending on future patches

#####

games rough around the edges and ive no idea what most traits do i assume doing the matching colours raises that colour and provides whatever trait bonus u picked but overall beautiful art

lots of potential

#####

it is fun peaceful and addictive

#####

a neat little game with a lot of promise i dont like the clouds that darken the screen hopefully there will be an option to turn that off in the future ui needs work and i cant figure out how to keep people from dying due to too many stacks of fatal played the tutorial but that was not explained
