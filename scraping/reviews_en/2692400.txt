long time early access player here and wartales is easily one of my top fave games with hundreds of hours spent adventuring the recent free additions in gosenberg and alazar were really good specially liked the later and was surprised it wasnt a dlc so i had high expectations for pirates as the first proper paid dlc

i like the new dlc but i dont love it while overall its fun a few of its systems really miss the mark for me i would give it a mixed review if i could 

early on you are presented with a ladder to climb to become the pirate lord taking out various rivals along the way but the duel mechanic used to dispatch them just isnt great or fun and looks quirky the mini games are perhaps the weakest part of wartales and to lean into those with duels wasnt the best move on top of it you can loose good fighters in ironman because the duel system completely ignores their gear stats and skills

the region while beautiful is is also too separated from the rest of the map both in geography and the systems i call it pirate bubble as that what it feels like returning to the mainland is jarring and disconnected an example is that the region it has its own healing recipewhich does exactly the same as a normal mainland one but because theyve over burdened the region with unique items they had to create one specifically so we now have a bunch of ingredients to carry around that do the same thing 

ship battles are ok for the first few but then become repetitive with the exact same layout i dont think theyre a great addition either and the boat is just yet more materials with its own long list of ingredients that just make the already challenged inventory even worse sailing is a slog and again you cant sail to any part of the mainland 

not the worst dlc but not shiros best work either over burdened with systems we didnt need and a dueling mini game that misses the mark wartales is a fantastic game and the devs are talented but this is one best bought in a sale

h2overviewh2
bthis dlc expands the games world significantly offering new areas to explore however its vastness is undermined by a lack of depth in content and activitiesb

h2gameplay experienceh2
the dlcs highlight is its boat mechanics and sailing experience which while technically impressive lacks the engagement i hoped for the joy of sailing feels fleeting especially considering the price point of 20

h2content qualityh2
new additions such as weapons armor and enemies are present but they fall short in originality often feeling like reskins of existing models this lack of innovation detracts from the dlcs overall value

h2combat mechanicsh2
ship battles and duels while abundant fail to deliver the excitement one would expect the largescale naval conflicts come across as chaotic but unfulfilling and what could have been thrilling duels end up feeling lackluster

h2new featuresh2
new features like the bounty list introduce novelty but quickly turn repetitive with simple dialogues missing deeper engagement opportunities

h2conclusionh2
in its current state the dlc feels like a missed opportunity it presents a large new area to explore but fails to fill it with compelling content while there are some new features they dont justify the asking price for those seeking a rich and engaging expansion to the base game

h2recommendationh2
i hesitate to recommend this dlc at its current price point especially for players expecting a depth of content matching its expansive new areas

#####

after 165h in the main game i didnt even bothered to search for reviewes on this one just bought it 
despite some annoying frustrating featuressituations  wartales is incredibly awesome and addictive turn based strategy with solid group mgmt crafting combat and cooking 
shiro games dev team had proved themselves in my eyes to be responsible and passionate of what they are doing thus i give them my money to get more of the same  with a ship 

ahoy

#####

full of bugs even after the hot fix multiple achievements are not counted including the visit all interested spot killing the champion if you have killed the champion before the patch good luck time for a new save the bugs are already there when you enter the new region its feel like the dev didnt bother hiring unpaid interns to test their products oh wait they already  up the switch port

the sailing is so so so boring its just running but with less control
the boarding action is freaking stupid since its can just be a regular land battle
the 25h promised gameplay is basically 2 hours stretched out thanks to the sssssssssllllllllllooooooooooowwwwwwwwww sailing experience 
treasures works the same way you find a map then you go to that spot you dont even have to dig it up its already there on the ground on the freaking ground all of the pirate treasures

the duel system drag combat down to a hold you can outmaneuver you can set them up for a precise balista shot but if you dont win this rockpaperscissor mini game with the boss good luck he will grind through your whole lineup i understand that the ai of this mini game is not that smart they always atk on the 1st turn so you can block it but it feels like an uncooked idea and i freaking hate it

so no this dlc does not worth your money nor your time

#####

its a pirates life for me you guys should add flintlock guns for rangers

#####

fantastic

this isnt really a critique but the borders of the base game world never made much sense roads that just lead to invisible walls there are no tells you have to figure out where the world ends on your own i figured that was where the expansion areas would come in it was an interesting choice to add an archipelago instead of fleshing the main laindmass out am i the only person who thinks that doesnt really matter game is still a lot of fun

#####

after seeing the trailer reveal i stopped playing for 2 weeks so i could start a new game with the dlc

i bought the dlc today and started a new game  ive now had to restart 3 times due to gamebreaking bugs

 guards start running after me and wont stop running  i ended up stuck in stromkarp with 6 groups of guards running around the city
 contextual camp tools stopped appearing no wells in cities no monoliths in plains no trees in forests etc
 playing adaptive and was attacked by a group of enemies 3 levels higher than me

if you like the game id recommend getting the dlc while its on sale  but wait until january to play it after theyve released a few rounds of bug fixes

#####

when the sails are out the ship moves automatically makes sense when you get stuck somewhere and ahead is blocked say by a coastline or a rock the ship is stuck and you can not reverse by rowing backwards makes less sense
got no prior save and the game is now utterly stuck together with the ship and can not be progressed any further desperately needs a reverse option

#####

disappointing dlc slow and annoying sailing unfair patrols spawn from nowhere

#####

i truly enjoyed the main game experience even thoguh i wasnt that interested in the plots and it couldve been done better the possibility of repalyability or the fighting in the game are something to look forward to

or at least were this dlc is trash the main game was grindy yes but this took it to another level i dont even bother reading anything as its so damn boring the sailiing on the seas and the battles 20v20 are taking for ever there are fun activites dont take me wrong but if you barely finished the main game or didnt finish then dont buy it

#####

i am enjoying it immensely maybe because i had a pillars of eternity deadfire itch and soundtrack running in the background 

it doesnt excuse shiro from having to implement now very overdue qol improvements from the option to speedup movement in combat to using the nearby stash when crafting in a village or a boat to fatalities when animals kill

#####

was excited by the announcement of this but ive found the content lacking for the price a missed opportunity by the devs to delivery something special duels are a really bad feature my advise is wait for a sail pun intended

#####

without the addon i played more than 200 hours and super fun 810
but this addon is a no deal that turned from excitement into wanting to finish the game as soon as possible
artificially prolonged ship battles unbalanced amount of ropes on our ship in relation to the enemy
they took the worst mechanics from the basic version and stuffed them everywhere enemies boring and undemanding worse than the bandits in tiltren
the main storyline is a fedextype quest a boss fight crawling through two phases
no meaningful soundtrack no variety in fights and interactions  just stuff islands and search for treasures
not a fan of the addon although the ship sailing and expansion was sensible
410 because you can still see a wellexecuted part of the concept and character creation

#####

the devs are real fast with the bugfixes and pirates are awesome steamhappy

#####

love wartales but the dlc is crap the whole duel system is simply nothing more than rock paper scissors not joking ship customization isnt a thing im stuck with pinkish and green sails to strike fear among the pirate hordes and a lot of the new systems are jinky and unpolished this is not a dlc where you can encompass the way of the dread pirate this is a dlc made to sucker you in because who the hell doesnt want to be jack sparrow

#####

i want to start off by saying that the base game is great and i loved playing it ive done three playthroughs of it so far trying out various different build types and strategies and trying all the different narrative options this dlc on the other hand i wish i hadnt bought it the new ship battles are frustrating when the enemy can just disrupt your formation any time they want with the new drop in mechanic the descriptions for the new weapons enemy unit types and new status effects are just convoluted and confusing i can try reading the description for one of the new pirate enemy attack types three times in a row and i still wont know what they do i have to cross reference the new abilities and status effects its just too convoluted the new pirate duel system is just a lazy version of rock paper scissors that i still have to click the help  icon every time to have it explained again the status effects in the base game are for the most part well writen and simple to understand bleed burning poison etc the base game is challenging but fun although it can get pretty repetitive sometimes but this dlc its just confusing and feels like a chore to remember all these new mechanics i havent completed the region scenario to get all the unlocks and craftable items and i dont think i will be trying to complete it either maybe the storyline will be good enough to be worth the slog through this confusing mess

#####

conclusion
rating   good edging on great 
ive nearly completed everything in the region and found this to be a wonderful and engaging addition to wartales and by far my favorite region to explore although some of the new mechanics fall short the new region new enemy types additional class more representation and diversity in the types of characters you can have stylistic expansions more loot extra lore and stories and importantly the inclusion of a ship and the ability to travel on the high seas makes this a worthwhile addon if youve been enjoying the base game while it was disappointing to discover the new travel mechanic is limited to the new region thus creating the belerionbubble the actual experience within the region is quite fun and one can hope that this well executed mechanic will be added to further expansions of the map an entirely worthwhile addition to the game its worth the full price of admission 

graphics
 you forget what reality is
 beautiful
 good
 decent
 bad
 dont look too long at it
 msdos
comments same graphics as the last few free offerings and the base game but the stylistic design changes that accompany belerion and its various inhabitants offer a ray of new eye candy the mediterranean environment is seriously amazing and impressive to look at as you chart the waves of the new region fully living up to the other regions in offering a distinctive look 

gameplay
 very good
 good
 its just gameplay
 mehh
 watch paint dry instead
 just dont
comments doesnt entirely reinvent the wheel as some of the new systems eg your ship are really fun to engage with while others eg dueling can be frustrating and repetitive but most are just addons eg new enemies new loot new battle maps etc to an already strong base game so its more of the same but that same was already good and thus theres very little to complain about 

audio
 eargasm
 very good

 mediocre

comments anyone can play this game 

pc reqs
 check if you can run paint
 potato
 decent
 fast
 rich boi
 ask nasa if they have a spare computer
comments played this on a rtx3070 with overall aboveaverage specs and it runs smooth as butter the dlc did include an occasional visual delay when fighting a particular reptilian enemy type but with each successive patch it becomes less noticeable unless youre hunting dragons like robert baratheon if the base game runs well then this should too 

difficulty
 just press w
 easy
 easy to learn  hard to master
 significant brain usage
 difficult
 dark souls
comments began playing the dlc on my expertexpert difficulty level save and found the region to be somewhat easier than alazar or ludern despite the enemies ranging from level 1214 and my crew entering at 912 however that might just be a product of figuring out how to approach ship combat in a way that prevented the ai from taking full advantage of its mechanics something you cant as easily do on land resource and econ management are more difficult in the region though but if you already have a large war chest it should be fine 

grind
 nothing to grind
 only if u care about leaderboardsranks
 isnt necessary to progress
 average grind level
 too much grind
 youll need to make this your second job
comments isnt very grindy unless you want to kit your crew out with all the new armor 

story
 no story
 some lore
 average
 good
 lovely
 itll replace your life
comments the main story is decent enough with fun side quests dotted throughout the islands but the additional lore is much more interesting especially with hints pointed towards map expansions in edoran and akhed 

length
 long enough for a cup of coffee
 short
 average
 long
 to infinity and beyond
comments not too long not too short though it depends on how mission driven you are 

price
 its free
 worth the price
 if its on sale
 if u have some spare money left
 not recommended
 you could also just burn your money
comments worth 20 or whatever your regional currency is if you were in the mood for more wartales 

bugs
 never heard of
 minor bugs
 can get annoying
 ark survival evolved
 the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs
comments some bugs have been reported though the patches have done a good job at clearing many of them 


#####

excellent expansion  i hope there will be more dlc

#####

the main game is really really good but this dlc is a pain to play the pirate ladder board fights are very annoying its not really a sandbox to explore anymore but instead enemies constantly chasing you where ever you go your mercenaries die unnecessarily in the final boss battle mini game which are quite boring because if you lose the mini game which relies on rng to some extent you are at no health and often stand in fire and thus die this is not fun fix it
same goes for the slow ship movement as well as the very slow ship progress
the new class looks fun on paper but really who asked for a fist fighting class you cant even see the weapon which is a bummer and the class is way to op at the moment why not include muskets or pistols that would have been fitting 
overall 410 dlc 910 main game ill go back to the mainland

#####

h1tldr this dlc is not worth the money dont buy it wait for some fixes and changes i regret ith1

 pirate ranking system is garbage after every new up you will get hunted
 ship navigation and the sea are plain boring
 the combat on every ship is annoying every time there will be reinforcement on the ship
 you cant just defeat the captain in the pirate ranking u need to fight 1v1 in a rockscissorpaper mode
 now we have dragonskinda weird
 cursed villages are now even more annoying 2 whole rounds till you can escape

#####

no no no
why do you release a dlc for a game that is one of the best in his genre and you dont test it
20 seconds after getting my first ship navigate to much nearby the coast i imagine it just stuck on the ground
no way to unstuck it just reload the last save game from 1 hour before
dont buy it for six months and then it will be fine for now is just to be refunded

#####

ill be king of the pirates and earn the one piece in this game  d

#####

a bit pricey but its a lot of content so well worth it feels like a proper expansion pack the ship mechanics on the world map are interesting and the boarding battles are fun if a bit confusing at first the new zone is enormous so theres plenty of space for sailing around and quite a few islands many of which have little settlements i think ive explored maybe a little over half of them thus far also pretty interesting to learn about the belerion and ihrian cultures my main complaint is the pirate leaderboard  its a neat feature overall but exploring shouldnt give you progress on it in my opinion  it makes you have to back off and pace yourself when you want to just look around because simply exploring just gives you so many points anyways 1010 would make my troops pet lizard edgar the ships ballista master again

#####

you can close you eyes and press purchase



there is some bugs
ill trust those guys this game has heart

#####

cant finish this dlc because of bugs

#####

as recommended here i just bought it blindly  just kidding as a former ea buyer i know that shiro has high ambitions and they didnt deliver on everything straight away but this is to expected in a complex game what i do know is that they are very passionate about this game and have delivered and overdelivered on the main games as well so im 100 sure that they will iron out the bugs and listen to the community closely to address any gameplay issues in this dlc as well

im not affiliated with shiro or paid for the review 

#####

a solid expansion to a solid game this new map is more of the same with some original twists and additions
also some people reported bugs ive never experienced the game experience has been very smooth for me

#####

meh kind of pricey for the content there are also annoying bugs introduced with this dlc where you cant interact with world map items for example loc island has intractable stones youre supposed to left click to turn over but you cant actually interact with them

#####

this dlc have lot of bug that break the game a bug where once i end my companion turn it just stuck and wont allow the next unit to play another one is when i use landing kill on boat battle the dead enemy still stand up with no hp bar and all uimenu suddenly gone  make it impossible to end my turn or do any other action because the ui is gone  all this bug only happen on boat battle

#####

how can a bear be kicked into water by a man

#####

first impressions httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5l89xm2eah8
horible dlc it just ticks the same boxes arena hunt rouste main quest and some new food types and plants
whats new its the sailing wich is a very boring side quest your ship has to sail a huge body of water with few islands and even fewer interesting spots on them for example there are 2 mines on different islands in a normal map it would take maybe 2 minutes to mine them in this dlc is 10 minutes to farm them
they are also reusing the same models with small changes for everything ship combat is more dynamic and interesting but also more tedious if you have 10 mercs you will hate ship combat
this is the exact defition of the dlc made by a small polish studio i am sure the original developers of wartales didnt create this dlc the quality of this 20 euro dlc for a 35 euro game is silly dont buy this for more than 5 euros because its a mess

#####

ship stuck inside the  mountain  cant move cant get out cant do anything

#####

enjoyable and difficult expansion really enjoyed the ocean elements visuals and audio not sure why it is getting the hate my only complaint would be the price if it was buggy then most of that appears fixed ive had a few minor bugs in the odd combat

#####

great dlc 20hrs of content and thats if you do it with all the best equipment 

the new class may be a little overpowered but nothing crazy i got the base game and dlc together so i didnt even realize it was a new class just know i like punchy stab guys 

as of right now i only had a couple glitches neither were game breaking just reload to get unstuck

ship fights add some fun mechanics to add a bit of chaos into the normal combat

#####

loving the expansion  sail ships be a pirate loot and create mayhem

tons of extra content  missions areas to explore tombs to find

#####

ayoooo you can be a pirate now dlc is lit if you loved games like i sid meiers pirates the vampire coast of tww3 or pillars of eternity ii i its made for you

its elegantly integrated and brings a lot of little things above the main selling points of the dlc

regarding the price you can put it like this 

it costs something close to one pizza is it worth the price
if the answer is i would prefer to be a pirate for hours than to eat one single pepperonni with a coke dont think twice

and were gonna get free stuff for it later along the road iykyk 
they already prove to care a great deal for the game and the community
you gotta acknowledge the true love they put into this game 

let them cook ahoy

#####

if theres one thing i respect shiro games for it is their intention to innovate problem is this intention does not come with a good quality to back this up the dlc release was met quite cold due to the lack of quality control and user experience in general but instead of improving what was considered controversial shiro games just simply cut off the loose ends and by that i mean almost removing features from the dlc 

for example there are few new combat arenas and one of which takes place on board the ship there are ropes which can be used by your mercenaries or enemies respectively i guess enemies used to take advantage of this mechanic too often and it was kind of annoying but now ive yet to see a single fight where these ropes are used by the enemies

another thing i want to mention is the lack of a soundtrack theres a new track when you are aboard the ship but when you leave it to explore the new areas you hear the same old damn tune you can here anywhere in wartales and it ruins the immersion so much for me that i decided it is worth mentioning here 

pirates of belerion dlc is a fine addition if you want to squeese out of wartales simply more wartales but it could have been a much better experience if it was better thought out and cooked a bit longer

#####

personally i think it is a great addition to the base game 
i love the new class i like the ship mechanics exploration of sea is a lot of fun too plus i love pirates so it would be hard for me to hate this dlc 
fits perfectly for the base game and adds a lot more fun to be had 
i will continue playing this game for many years to come i have been playing since early access i can see all the hard work the developers put into the game and will support them whenever i can
keep up the amazing work

#####

it was pretty fun sailing around in this pirate themed dlc  still wish they let us use our horse companions as mounts

#####

nice dlc

#####

great expansion really enjoying the new content

#####

new contentssailing ship and faction creatures in dlc are pretty good
but some of bugs should be fixed asap

#####

got it for 15 for me its worth it around 30 hours of game play and somewhat new content cheers to the dev team looking forward for another dlc and map expansion to this amazing gem

#####

it adds boats and lizards the only two things missing from this game also those darn pirates are kinda tough 1010

#####

the amount of content is worth the 20 bucks and is a refreshing addition to the game

#####

buggy as hell not all achievements working some blueprints are inaccessible gameplay is boring lots of empty spaces without anything interesting waste of money

#####

great dlc must play

#####

overall 70100h fun

 cool mapcampainbossfights
 feel good sailing feature with customizable ship
 new minigame to clime leaderboardsome dislikes it was fine for me
 few blocking bugs i had to reload foredit mostly fixed after holidays in v1032047
more than i m used to from shiro  maybe more qatesting needed

crossfunded the free update
 interesting new classstanceswitching fistfighter
 new cultureswas getting a bit bland for me

#####

i was so busy playing the game to bother dropping a review just learned its getting review bomb so i come for a thumb up to tip the scale
the dlc contains a massive amount of content ship new combat mechanics new exploration mechanics new battle maps new food items with cool bonuses new character class new factions new story a lot of treasure to be found
there are bugs as people said but nothing is game breaking and shiro developers are working hard to fix them

#####

great game

#####

personally i like pob but the problem with it is that it feels largely out of place compared to the rest of the countys in wartales while you go around on the mainland bashing skulls getting rich and completing the main scenarios before moving on to explore the next area feeling like youre starting a new chapter in your adventure pob feels like the start of a new book it feels far too different compared to the other parts of the game and while that isnt a bad thing per say it makes the transitions between belerion and the mainland feel weird and unfamiliar at times 

while upgrading your boat is essential for surviving the archipelago of belerion once youre done with belerion and head back to the mainland youll never use the boat again making the resources you spent on it feel wasted in contrast when you complete an area on the mainland you carry all your shiny new gear money and new company members along with you which genuinely makes you feel more powerful when you step into a new zone

its a weirdly implemented dlc but for what its worth its a fun dlc but maybe not 24 worth sailing is cool but gets pretty stale and annoying when wind zones arent in your favour the zone itself is nice to look at and the loot is alright but designed to be used in belerion specifically

i think it was a step in more or less the right direction in terms of adding some spice to wartales but hopefully shiro can improve even more on their next expansion

#####

looks and feels great everything ive seen thus far has been top notch my only complaint really is that it seems like its level 10 only so you really have to grind to end game before you can play the dlc i wish there was a quickstart option to start levelled up to the zone thatd would make it pretty perfect 3

#####


i duplicate it for dlc
after the newly minted update pirates of belerion there were only dirty words addressed to the developers not only is the addon sold for 23 game prices adding endgame content and breaking according to fellow reviewers the balance to hell so it is still
1 prohibits players who do not have this addon from connecting
2 introduces bugs including critical ones due to an overload bug we need to drop the save cell
the game is not full of variety so losing progress in which we managed to overcome several extremely annoying relative to the level of search patrols create part of the camp and assemble a good squad is a real spit in the face from the creators of the game and the testers of the addon in particular

#####

dont let others stop you from playing this great game and the dlc they work just fine for me im yet to run into any bugs that ive noticed

#####

adds a considerable amount of sailingbased mechanics along with a large new region the content is enjoyable and the story endgame boss is epic

#####

i love it great addition to the main game  sailing around the islands is a lot of fun and really beautiful

#####

im on a boat motherfucker take a look at me
straight floating on a boat on the deep blue sea yeah yeah
busting five knots wind whipping out my coat
you cant stop me motherfucker cause im on a boat
take a picture trick trick im on a boat bitch bitch

im on a boat motherfucker dont you ever forget
im on a boat and its going fast and
i got a nautical themed pashmina afghan
im the king of the world on a boat like leo
if youre on the shore then youre sho not meoh

#####

great expansion for an already good game  

sailing around a region is a nice change up  respectable amount of new enemies and gear  

pricing is reasonable for whats been added in my opinion  hoping they do a knightsmounted combat kingdom dlc next

#####

whoooo more content

#####

fantastic game
same goes for dlc
always support your good quality games


#####

great dlc

#####

fun with boat

#####

great dlc love it very much  super new content makes me happy
tons of new stuff 
i love stronger enemies on the highest difficulty and now there are really strong units thx
please do more of this

#####

its not a good sign when the bugs of the game meet you straight at the storelibrary when i have bought the game twice after getting the refund first time around didnt add to my library second time around still no difference steam recognises that i bought after the refund cleared the store doesnt recognise that i own the dlc now i guess i am now the concept of insanity whilst im like just let me play your game lol hopefully theyll fix this along with their gameso ive heard from other reviews and so we can all enjoy the sweet sweet world that shiro games have made i need to hear me some welsh voice acted pirates lol

#####

who thought the rope idea was ever a good idea especially for them to respawn every single round the first impression is i dont want to play this game anymore

#####

buggy and stuttering think again before buy it

#####

na

#####

havent played the dlc yet  because a bug wont let me  the update introduced a couple bugs including one that literally prevents me from playing the game because it freezes everytime in a certain arena and i saved right before it happens really nice shiro  

this will most likely be positive when i can play the game  dlc again

#####

bought it reinstalled wartales on game page in library says dlc was added and installed no evidence it installed on game page in store does not say its in my library but says it purchased on my steam account im so confused

#####

your dlc is broke wtf

#####

i bought this so you didnt have to

shiro games has been pushing out patches full of bugs  takes months to fix a many of the minor but annoying bugs
they only deal with the major ones that break the game

if you dont mind being a beta tester  dealing with the bugs by all means go ahead

come back in a few months when the game is more polished

update 1 week after launch 21 dec 2023
some bugs fixed yet even more things broken
this really should be an early access or beta branch until all the major issues are ironed out
but burning goodwill is also an option

#####

i bought the dlc and made sure that both the game and dlc were installed but when i launch the game nothing is new how do i know if i did this right

#####

una piacevole aggiunta richiama molto sid meyers pirate lemozione di navigare aggiunge una nuova dinamica al gioco i combattimenti si fanno più intensi e richiedo attenzione per non essere sbalzati fuori bordo
la storia la ho apprezzata con alcuni elementi innovativi che si aggiungono rendendo le missioni più articolate
nuove equipaggiamenti nuovi cibi nuovi bonus  e una nave a vostra disposizionepenso non ci sia bisogno daltro

#####

sadly i can not recommend this dlc the base game is already very challenging and hard with 2 provinces being so hard that they are almost inaccessible due to very tough enemies and endless poison and fire spam and what developer did they made a dlc with new complex mechanics a new region that is very hard again with even more poison and fire spam its a joke

in pirates of belerion you basically sail around many small islands with almost no towns or trading posts for repair material healing nothing my crew lost so much money food and time exploring islands with literally no rewards whatsoever you will encounter poison crocs and pirates with torches that are very hard to beat i wish developer made one big region accessible to casual players not a masochistic dlc with even more poison and fire spam these posion and fire mechanics are so annoying feels like an artificial way to increase the difficulty of the game

#####

not really that fun i dont like pirate games

#####



#####

embark on over 20 hours of set sail in the sea

#####

i bought the dlc but dont see the new content i still see the message that i have to buy dlc in the game dlc is expensive but devs do it like shit do not buy this dlc

#####

fitrst

#####

can spend hours in this world

#####

very nice addition to the game i love the new content

#####

nice expansion with tons of content if you enjoyed the base game this dlc is a must

#####

love me some pirates

#####

after 150 h i just start the dlc its nice i wish there is class with gun and 1 hand weapon like true pirate

#####

yes bit expensive and buggy at the time of release

#####

fun game adds a lot of new mechanics that makes the game challenging like its meant to be cant wait to polish off the story good stuff boys

#####

an excellent addition to a wonderful game

#####

a great addition to the base game

#####

more wartales always good

#####

i can highly recommend the dlc so far the pirate theme and the ships are a great addition to the main game

#####

its a bit confusing when you buy it as the first indication would be
 starting a new game start in tiltren
 a popup will tell you a ship washed ashore in the south

the buy now popup remains in the main menu

#####

fantastic addition to the game another 25 hours of core gameplay great new combat zones with new characters and beasts new weapons and well though out class highly recommend the devs are active still and constantly hosting streams etc

#####
