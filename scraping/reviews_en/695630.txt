这简直就是ios版原封不动我求你有点当时的电脑版的原来的诚意吧

h1 毫无诚意的移植作品h1

updated on 31st aug 2018
本版的命运和超时空之轮chrono trigger这个ign百大rpg之首steam版是一对难兄难弟啊二者的steam版本都可惜是残缺货

updated on 6th nov 2017 strike 又是有关尚书府的bug就如同community hub里反映的那样
httpssteamcommunitycomapp695630discussions01479857071256607712

b u bug导致无法推动主线剧情 u b目前唯有通过跳过此段的存档解决strike  官方今日的hotfix亲自测试已解决

upedated on 4th nov 2017 官方进行了第二次更新对我重要的一点是十里香bug总算修复了本人曾遇到过使用十里香后倒计时结束偶然崩溃或者无限遇敌可以用十里香聚怪sl大法缩短一点十里坡剑神的时间


strike官方最应该修复的bug 进入战斗界面经常会出现的绿线 在载入游戏后的第一次战斗场景不会出现在第二次及其后会出现除非存档后读取档案之后仍然第一次不出现第二次出现另外此绿线在战败画面里一样会出现strike 11月24日的更新已经修复

updated on 18th oct 2017 昨天看见官网升级的公告看来官方还是比较重视的希望能把其他bug也能修复

olist
     ui是ios的厂商真逗steam不是apple store新仙剑本身有windows版的
     strike  宣传的交换卡牌也没有看见strike 掉卡牌了可惜有人物对应错误的问题用b韩梦慈 b的头像作林月如年少时期
     strike 不支持高分辨率也就罢了连全屏都不支持是什么意思  确认是altenter strike

the classic chinese rpg of 90s the touching story has impact me a lot since i played it long time ago and could be hardly replaced by other rpgs since then

#####

这不是仙剑只是粗糙的同名手游移植稀烂的ui原版古朴的界面完全不见物品在橱柜里闪闪发光昭然若揭完全失去了当年翻箱倒柜的快感无法忍受退货

#####

very very buggy often unable to save and lose a lot of progress as a result

#####

although this game may seem suck if you play it nowadays it was remastered in 2000 i guess for a 95s game and it really brings so many childhood memories nearly 30 years i can finally play it again for me what attracts me is the deeply moving story and plots and really hope this game can be revived  in a better way

#####

dont waste your time this remake is terrible even if they fix all the bugs
clunky controls this game is missing a lot of quality of life improvements the little things do add up
go play the original version

#####

this series is part of my childhood but this game completely disappointed me you can see cheapness anywhere from its ui to its frame its good to have a more 3d view but it actually blocks some items and makes them impossible to pick the most important thing is its too buggyyyyyyyy the bug has made me lose a lot of savedata and wasted several hours of my life

#####

不要做仙剑8了 重置仙剑1吧

#####

垃圾制作原版的地图结构全部都毁了好多过场动画给删了最不能忍受的是存档问题真的有问题那些评论说得都是真的你玩一会儿就会发现存档失败然后你进度就全没了95年版是经典中的经典但是这个版本的游戏就是个垃圾

#####

为了情怀回来刷一遍游戏运行上倒是没有碰到什么问题战斗难度感觉比以前简单了不少作为回味情怀倒是挺好的关键问题就是ui实在不走心战斗按钮莫名非要把自动战斗和逃跑放那么明显的地方以前都是二层菜单里面的键盘操作很容易误点ui下点功夫优化的话还是可以的

#####

this game is a nostalgia for my childhood but sadly it crashes quite often also therere items cant be picked up from ground didnt expect that buggy

#####

评论区里的问题暂时没遇到过闪退但是一直存档有问题如果不打一个怪存一个档估计想起来的时候已经丢失了一大段进度

#####

本来一开始玩的时候就是想打个情怀好不容易收集到了月如结局所需要的物品就是想要复活月如结果打完了拜月以后闪退你特么的在逗我

#####

童年时代为数不多的良心之作愿意回头再花时间再打一遍虽然是二十多年前的作品自由度很低剧情也有不少一言难尽的地方但总体而言还是非常不错的

#####

please do not buy this game totally rubbish the game have been shut down for no reason i had to play for the same things again

#####

i cant finish this game because it wont let me save my process after several hours of playing and once it crashes you have to start from the process several hours ago i could do it once but not twice

#####

bug 太多经常闪退不推荐

#####

steam 版 重置了一个手机版的ui界面 所有的老版快捷键都不能用 难怪玩家都喜欢98版嫌你们这作粪

#####

放到别的游戏早几把骂你了 玩的实在受不了这个操作跟界面了纯纯的触屏移植游戏

#####

为什么浪费时间玩这个破玩意

#####

pro  paladin 
con chinese

fr though not a bad game 

#####

因小時候沒玩到這款特地買來玩玩看整體遊玩起來很流暢只能說以前的遊戲做得很用心 只有遇到一個問題後面靈兒加入時要去試煉窟學招式時就會出現bug導致我後面沒學到那些絕招就去打王如果這點可以改善的話可以說是接近100分的遊戲了

垃圾游戏存都存不了

#####

will there be a remake

#####

無法儲存請給我回饋謝謝

#####

在还原经典之外加了一些完善剧情的桥段整体的画面人物的形象比原版进步很大不过怪物居然是3d渲染的2d贴图材质和光照限于时代因素非常粗糙不自然

#####

of course i would recommend this game to the others if they were interested just beware of d save and load file problem it oftenly happened between 30 mins to 2 hours make your save before the game crashes normally it would just crash without warning you from saving just oftenly check your save will do the job

played on windwos 10

#####

beautiful art and really amazing story line overall great gaming experience

#####

i love this game since 1997 and since i use ios im so glad that i can play in steam again i love the story so so much

#####

a very poor remakererelease whatever you want to call it 

very buggy
new animation and artwork is really not as good as the original
gameplay is not challenging at all now you can just keep spamming spells

would only recommend buying if you want to experience the story

#####

for me is yesssssssss because this game is my childhood game no one can replace it when i was young i keep played this game again and again i know the story is sad ending but i very like its story 
but this remake one is quite harder than the original one this game still can improve i think because there is still has some bug

#####

兒時回憶

#####

撒大声地

#####

a bit buggy port of a classic game however there is an issue with saving the game progress sometimes this has made me redo an entire mazedungeon because i couldnt save my file hope the devs will fix this one day

#####

a classic reminding me of my childhood
