no 
no content 
broken game
sliders that dont function properly 
super computer and the game still runs like dogwater janky and very poor performance
combat is an absolute joke id laugh if it were funny
this honestly looks like something you could whip up in about a month or two with minimal staff working on the game 
one speed only and no option to speed it up or down

even ignoring the bugs which are pretty staggering there is just nothing to do might be good in a year or two but it needed a delay they only released it early so victoria 3 wouldnt body them and it seems like they just wanted to cut their losses 

its very sad because i enjoy niche games like this but outside of just memeing around with a friend assuming the mp even works there is currently nothing to do in game and this wont even hold a candle to victoria 3 when it launches later this month 

just buy victoria 3 instead

#####

i was skeptical of this game from the beginning seeing as there was absolutely 0 gameplay footage right up until release the one streamer they gave the game to was terrible and playing on an outdated build 

it didnt take long in playing superpower 3 that my fears were confirmed this is a hollow buggy poorly designed mobile game if anything nothing seems to flow together the music is cheap and annoying and most importantly the game just feels empty things dont make sense and seem like there was 0 thought put into any components of the game just as an example there are flags placed on the globe for various countries but its a top down game with no option to adjust so you cant even see the flag youre just looking at the top of a flagpole small but anecdotal of a whole bunch of other lazy design choices or overlooked areas of the game

 i know superpower games are what you make of it but even then its hard to get any enjoyment out of this game 

i genuinely believe this game mustve been slated for 2023 but rushed to release because of victoria 3 coming out soon im refunding this game and perhaps ill pick it up again maybe next year but i definitely have a sour taste in my mouth

#####

steams refund function is the only thing that worked well with this purchase avoid like the plague

#####

it has been abandoned no more updates and lost support

#####

scam


advised to update my review by developers although i updated it multiple times even without them asking me when patches were released and i felt so now i feel their response is invasive but still update my review

still not recommend you to purchase it unless you wanna spend 25 for the right to have a voice in a game development project and start reporting bugs or new features which are available in other games superpower 2 cots 224 at the time of review and 75 players playing it comparing it to superpower 3 which have 17 players the tiny community which is left still prefers the old game over the new one buy victoria 3 you will not regret it

positives
 great music after playing victoria 3 not so great
 world map looks nice with nightday cycle and clouds much better than in previous games added props with latest patches although there is no variety in that and dubai lets say is still a desert while egypt is full with the same skyscrapersafter playing victoria 3 i realised i was wrong the map is not even that nice i compared it to superpower 2 and it looks better that but victoria is on another level in every aspect
 multiplayer is an option however the average player base is 1020 players according to steamdb 31 players in 24h peak at the time of review compare to 1343 when it was released players left which is a shame victoria 3 at the time of review shows 38259 players and it has multiplayer option too
 trading system is a nice addon and if you figure out how to do it you can double your economy in every few years

negatives 
 visual bugs still apparent such as flags missing eswatini the map occasionally shows tiles  i guess when its loading something in the background and these glitches more apparent after longer gameplay or heavy load on your computer

 the gameplay slows down dramatically after a few hoursi also experienced a crash after the third update since then i havent played for more than 10 minutes the sliders are still lagging and not responsive
 the world looks nice but at the same time the game is still feels empty they added random events so it feels more real such as avalanches in sierra leone cold waves in guinea or nuclear meltdowns in jordan or syria this makes the game feels more alive 
 there is no diplomacy or secret service against your country even if you do it against others you dont know whats happened apart from a text window saying it was successful yey you are alone

 no international organisations is a huge disappointment

rating 

summary we have received multiple patches since release and they are trying to fix it there is potential in the game but it is going to be a long process years if this project is on kickstarter i wouldnt mind spending my money on it however this supposed to be a finished game and i think its an early alpha with multiple issues if you believe to have spare time to report bugs or wanna be part of a game development project buy it otherwise not the hardliners stayed and still play it that 30 people but the rest of us play other games

experience on release date which according to them have been fixed havent tried it since then as i am playing victoria 3  therefore this might have been irrelevant by now

 immersion  the world is only affected by your actions it does not move organically in any direction and you dont feel part of this world the immersion is 0 in this game

 diplomacy  i played for more than 6 hours with egypt and in the year 2035 i invaded israel with my starting military strange on multiple fronts and all this without any consequences no nukes were used and no war was declared against me after annexation i didnt get nukes myself maybe the israelis sold it to iran in the background no affects in terms of the relationship after annexations nothing changed with iran which was a theocracy or the arab world i guess they would very much like me in this scenario some nato members had 20 relationship with me but nothing else happened 

 warfare  during these 17 years no change in the offering on the military marketplace no military improvement from the ai no wars espionage or random events natural disasters or anything occasionally you get some aid requests from thirdparty countries but the game engine is not existent it is not a simulation its an empty map where you get a country and you can do whatever you want i liked the previous games battle screen and felt like you have some input on the outcome but here you cannot do anything utter chaos you send them in and they do whatever they want they cross borders to thirdparty countries lebanon jordan palestine and you have the option to annex that territory as well

 elections  you win elections easily you can tax the people as much as you want until you give them some healthcare and education and in the last 4 months you put a full budget on propaganda and you win the election after cancelling the elections nothing happened no internal issues or foreign interventions the secret service had no counterespionage tasks for 17 years

 economy  in 10 years my economy was 10x the size of my starting economy 25t with egypt while the rest of the world had their economies unchanged the fact you can only have trade deals if the sector is nationalised is illogicalthe investments sometimes work sometimes doesnt could be due to supply issues but there is no information about this

others
 i feel like the developers are lost in details the character creation page is so detailed and tbh you never use it however the economic tab is where you can spend a lot of time does not show your economic growth gdp how it compares to others etc or the employment in each sector or group inflation disappeared nonexistent the same is true for the territories there are thousands of them without any content you are not able to affect any territory with anything cant build cant invest another example of being lost in details is that the moving vehicles have rolling wheel animation like wtf who cares when your game is slow that the wheels are moving every time when the unit moves

#####

basically a scam

#####

i waited 8 years for this shit

this game is pretty rough half the leaders are named johnjane doe i cannot change my screen resolution past 1024x768 i have a 1200 dollar computer and the game runs like ass and overall this looks like an unfinished buggy mess you can not create new unit designs in the form of actually designing the model of your units the ai can also be unresponsive i walked right into territory most of the time and the country i invaded just let me take their land i have also seen very basic grammatical issues as well not a grammar nazi but some of these are just plain bad 

i do not intend to find out what else is wrong with this game as i have seen enough in the rough 30 minutes i have played to figure out i will not enjoy this game and will regret buying it

do yourself a favor stick to superpower 2 and wait for them to get their shit together with this game

#####

horrific golemlabs is finished i cant believe i waited for close to 15 years for this

#####

when you release a game i assume that its complete at least 80 and then devs keep going and try to increase completion percent by patches and updates this ht is not even 000001 ready a kid from highschool could make a better project dont buy it just dont even think to buy it no matter how bad decisions youve made in the past buy this game is a fatal mistake

#####

this game doesnt work too many bugs make it impossible to complete missions i waited 15 years for this game super disappointed

#####

thq nordic should been banned from selling any more games on steam this release was legit scam i should not have to waste time purchasing testing and refunding this game

steam needs perform some due diligence of its own before allowing games to go on sale this game is no where near feature complete and was not released as early access

#####

months after a broken game was released its still broken steam should remove this from the library do not buy

#####

unfinished cash grab 

the only reason i have not refunded it is because superpower 2 was also rough around the edges when it was first released
im hoping this game will be fixed with future updates but doubt it will ever happen because of how broken this game is right now 

do yourself a favour and avoid superpower 3 nothing super about it 




#####

was this a prank

#####

update 1 just a update to this review but thq and golemlabs have killed support for the game do not buy this game now its a dead game

original review to anyone who was a superpowers2 fan do not buy this game i purchased the game because i am a huge fan of the series and nothing ever scratched the itch like superpowers2 did for me but this game is unplayable constant crashes or disconnects from the server game breaking bugs with the economy basic things such as sliders not working correctly and just so much more the overwhelming negative reviews are warranted and non of the patches since release have improved the game in the slightest  i am sorry thq nordic but what you are selling on this platform is so bad that it feels like a legit scam i want this game to do well and i want to support you but i cant even play the darn thing for more than 30mins without a hard crash on a pc that is on the highend with a ryzen 9 7950x and rtx 3080ti

#####

this game killed the superpower legacy ive played superpower 2 for over a decade and loved it but this game is just extremely buggy and lacking features and the simplicity of sp2 i will keep the game to see if its improved in the future but as of now 05

#####

this game is a disgrace to the superpower franchise they killed it 

#####

the devs abandoned everything good about sp2 sold this then moved to bahamas with all the money

#####

i now realize how i have taken superpower 2 for granted

#####

wtf

#####

abandonware

#####

this game was a waste of money the ony reason i didnt request a refund was because i hoped it would get better instead they abandoned it dont buy

#####

ive been waiting for this game for 10 years and this is what we get dont even buy it even the developers havent played their own game they removed literally 50 of sp2s features and released the game in an incomplete empty way what a disgrace after years of waiting

#####

i have been a fan since sp1 i prayed they would get it right this time this is a huge step backwards probably killed the franchise i dont think they understand why this game was popular fundamentally they dont get it they couldnt possibly because they have systematically removed all that was good with every iteration of the game they took the aircraft carrier concept from sp2 and applied it to the entire game its 4 screens of funding levels on a recreated google earth its not a game you have no control you cant build bases airports nothing you can only build 1 military unit at a time literally you cant order different unit types simultaneous moving aircraft is a joke the game is trash i requested a refund

#####

refunded

feels like they released the wrong game files  half the game seems to be broken or missing
basic functions such as zooming in and out no tutorial huge amounts of buttons that dont have any impact good idea terrible execution

#####

this game was sold on being finished and complete it is now an open beta trials to make the game better i did not buy an open beta game i bought a game that was suppose to be finished and complete i tried getting a refund after 10 hours but was told no

i will say do not buy this game its is now in open beta and not finished
the devs were updating the game with very minor details every week at first but now its moved to open beta the future of this game is very very bleak
go play superpower 2 it was 4 times of many active players then this garbage 

also do not try and communicate with the devs they will not answer any questions

#####

ive seen enough
asked for the refund after 1 hour of gameplay 


#####

super power 2 was much better


#####

one of the best geopolitical games out there however as the reviews suggests this game is incomplete bugged and pretty much in its early alpha stages i personally do not understand the thinking process for the devs of this game for releasing it as a full game while it struggles so much

#####

longtime superpower 2 fan here i held off writing a review because i was hoping that development of this game would resume it has not and i dont think it will anymore i waited a decade and more for it

do not buy this game 

it barely runs and when it does it will inevitably break it is outrageous that it continues to be sold id be surprised if lawsuits havent been filed against both the developer and publisher for selling this broken product while it continues to be puts a massive stain on both thq nordic and golemlabs who if they had any selfrespect and care for the public perception of their companies would immediately pull it off every store

if you want a genuine example where the negative user reception is completely warranted this is it it didnt introduce predatory microtransactions it didnt have always online it didnt have aggressive drm it didnt cause its predecessor to be shut down in favor of it it is hated because it literally does not work 

this game is the manifestation of the incompetence of both golemlabs and thq nordic if their deficiencies could be represented as a video game this game is what that would look like

do not support companies that allow this to happen people waited decades for this game and thq nordic and golemlabs spat in their face and flaunt their success in doing so by continuing to sell it

do not buy this game

#####

as of this review superpower 3 is 34 off save 100 of this games price by not buying the game

i purchased this game the day it came out and i was quite disappointed
i did not get a refund because i was hoping this game would have been patched enough to be playable and a few months after release it was abandoned instead 
it wasnt just review bombed either it was review nuked into oblivion on day one even most of the positive reviews are sarcastic

for what few people might still play or buy this game there is a beta branch which is slightly more playable and slightly less buggy than the normal branch but i dont think anything for this game has been updated since january 2023

im going to split this into two parts things i like and things i dont like
 marks what i think is a feature but could be a bug  marks an obvious bug 

things i like
1 the world looks nice when it isnt bugging out and pixelating itself
2 the rts control of units and being able to actually see your units
3 the airports aircraft carriers and ports add a layer of realism by separating air units from land units but you also can use 
carriers as mobile airbases
4 economic failure seems impossible now

things i dont like
1  character creation in a strategy game which makes the game feel like a sims game with geopolitical elements
2  the many many bugs still unfixed
3 thq pulling the plug on sp3 
4  nuclear missiles act like theyre from a cartoon a small black cone or something would be more appropriate and would allow for many more warheads to be launched at the same time 
sp2 was actually more realistic despite its age especially with its quantity of nuclear weapons
5  strategic warfare seems actually quite tedious compared to what it was in sp2
6  the latency of commands given to units which only grows the larger your military and lower your tech level is
7  the globe provinces and countries eventually pixelating themselves making the game session unplayable
8  conflict zones seem like entirely separate areas and units dont seamlessly move in and out of those areas
9  building you military is very tedious as there isnt a queue system like in sp2 you have to build one type of unit at a time and they take an excessively long time to produce

there are probably more things i could add but i wont

i absolutely do not recommend buying this game

#####

you will not get the same joy you got from the first 2 this work is lazy and nothing like the smooth and  educated first 2 i dont think the developers took the time to play the first 2

#####

please do not buy

clunky at every level

since i want to be a least a little bit constructive ill concentrate on one part of this mess of a game military

1 unit icon  click on icon 5050 chance there is an actual unit there
2 have to move every single unit so if you have 300 tank units that consist of anything from 4 to 4000 individual tanks then you have to move every single unit
3 selling military equipment no clue how this works your roster is still filled with the equipment the icon is gone off the map why cant i just scrap the equipment
4 research for military no real control of designs got 150 different tank designs but only 1 actively used tank design then you will be rolling the mouse wheel for an hour when you try to build more
5 you can merge units but only of the same design which is a nightmare if you have the aforementioned 150 designs
6 combat the enemy will literally run rings around you enjoy the chase

im bored typing now just like when i tried to start organising a countries military and hit all the roadblocks mentioned above

#####

this review was written 091022 

i was given this game for free the retail price as im writing this review is about 30 with a 10 sale making it about 27 

before anything else i want to point out that this game only has 1 fairly slow speed setting meaning this turns out to be a fairly slow game to play 

i want to start with the things i really liked about this game sadly there is not too much to like its a very flavourless game with fairly little content and a fair few bugs and other issues which deduct from the fun i could have had 

alot of people dislike comparing it to sp2 however that was a 18 year old game which feels like it had roughly the same amount of content which this game does now sp2 was not a very deep game however it had alot of flavour and it allowed you to have fun with that flavour

 the roleplay servers of old on sp2 were so great because of the freedom you had withinn sp2 you wanted to play a theocratic communist uk which discriminates against english people  go right ahead there are ways to do that  as of today playing a country i can choose between allowing elections and not allowing elections and a very binary choice of dictatorship or democracy making a communist country and a theocracy more or less the same 

sp 2 allowed you to discriminatefavour based on religion language  sp3 downgrades that system and meshes culture religion and language all in one bloc for example  you have blackwhite south african demarking social group on racial grounds while other places its christian vs muslim tongoleese demarking social group on language grounds in serbia you have serbs and hungarian serbs well what seperates a hungarian and a hungarian serb if they live in the same country this also removes flavour 

sp2 had what felt like 200 diffrent economic sectors here we have maybe 16 autarky still appears to be the way to go they try to limit this with limiting the amount of farmland your country can have which does not really make the situation any better it just means you have to invade other countires in a long game 

im still trying to figure out how to use the unit designer and how to purchase more army units but this is probably because im retarded i dont think the ui is all that great you can have bad ui which is functional this appears just to be bad 

war has had a rewamp which is not horrible but far from great you now have to continiously occupy the provinces which you want to take over thats cool had it not been for the fact that some countires which are the size of a stamp have 1000 provinces and the usa has 50 there is no occupy button which there was in sp2 a feature i miss when we have to deal with continious occupation 

all in all its just disapointing it lacks a ton of features it has no flavour to speak off the servers were beyond fucked on release all in all im just disapointed i dont know if its because the devs were rushed or because the devs were lazy if you can get it on a super sale sure go for it if not stay clear

#####

do not buy this game isnt even finished there are literally pictures and icons missing so there are just checkbox fillers what a disgrace they knew tons of people loved sp1 and sp2 and they took advantage shame on steam for allowing this game to go on sell at the least this should have been early access so we knew what we were getting into but instead steam allows shit on their store and then refuse to refund you the only refund ive ever asked for on here and i cant get it stay away

#####

this game is complety unfinished i wanted to love it but there are so many things missing and gameplay is just a flat experience there is no depth in sp2 you had a lot of info and choices to micromanage your country in sp3 you have 810 sliders on your budget screen and 4 options of diplomacy with each country thats about it you still have a bit of military rd but that portion is tiny this needs a complete rethink from the developers side i was expecting even more depth and a lot nicer warbattle sim but sp2 is far superior to this game what a shame

#####

i have no doubt that they will fix this game up over time but when you release a game it should in fact be a game the current state of this game is not even prealpha its the equivalent of downloading a new project on unity dont buy this game yet keep watching the reviews and wait for it to be fixed

#####

during a single player game i got server disconnected i lost all the progress
is that a joke  that is unacceptable 

game industry need a nuclear bomb to eradicate this kind of studios

they made superpower 2 2004 and 30 of theguild3 before abandoning in 2018 the game now they publish this sp3 joke for 2999

they chose friday has a release date and decided to not work during the weekendlol
4 days after no news no patch from the studioon their internet page they clearly wrote we deplore overtime 
well we deplore your work 

8 customers on 100 enjoy the game  breaking record 

tomorow superpeople is out let forget this game  lets gooooooo

#####

the game is very buggy and pretty much unplayable the main publisher pulled support and no further updates from the developers have been done in over six monthsby that i mean no updateroadmap posts and no patch releases im an avid fan of the original superpower and superpower 2 but this game has been a huge let down in the franchise

#####

all you need to know is that this game is incomplete do not buy now also leave a really bad review so the developers know that releasing a game that is not even close to be fully complete is disrespectful and should never be done

#####

okay so the ui is terrible so far the ui is far too large it takes up way too much space the sliders barely function you can no longer see what percentage each party has in your country the singleplayer requires a connection  my internet cut out and it told me disconnected from server when i was in a singleplayer game the multplayer takes far too long to do anything messages take minutes to send decisions you make take minutes to take effect and overall the game lacks many features and polish that were in sp2 overall this is a massive let down and im going to give it a day before i request a refund

the game lacks so many features i do not know what to suggest firstly instead of excusing lazyness with  for the sake of simpclity show us what percentage each party and the party in power has in the nation played it showed you it in superpower 2 so you shouldnt excuse not adding a feature for  simplcity secondly in sp2 theres a  more info button that shows you all the current land you own population details terrarin details a description of said nation and its basic summary of information relating to information education and so on also the fact that you can not change the countries government type to what you want like you could in sp2 is dissapointing you can also no longer chose a party of the nation you want to begin with like you could in sp2 its just all really really sad to see features removed its pure laziness and it should not be excused what so ever

#####

hello dev its been 5 days since chaos why is there still no news when update release when new patch

ill buy the game again when its fixed

#####

game resources are spent on pointless and aesthetic aspects of the game like 40 avatars feature customization a new combat square that is equivalent to the old dust ball from an interaction perspective and beautiful shadowing over the cute little cities even if the combat square did not glitch out units and become stuck for the rest of the game the combat square would still be a downgrade from the superpower iis dust ball since it can entrap more than just the region the battle is centered on but the battle plays out too fast to make any interactions or decisions meaningful there are no consequences at the moment for almost any decision despite there not even being a choice of government typeupdate1you can now choose your government type and every nation will accept a proposed war declaration on any other nationupdate2nations now wont accept wars but still accept all other forms of diplomacy if relations are equal to north korea with italy i can not recommend this game to anyone who is not willing to be frustrated and patient with an unfinished productupdate3they now instead of releasing patches created an openbeta that we are playtesting patches for them before release

i continue to try and explore the game but each time a new downgrade exposes itself no map layers for any country but your own dead ai deathball only functional wartime strategy zero army differentiation across nations i think there are more avatar facial feature options than there are base military unit designs across the entire world overall there is very little to even get excited about at the moment since added statistics that should be showing how decisions and choices pan out over your nations timeline either do not work or are broken while they reduced political choices with limited consequences they increased economic decisions across economic sectors but these gains are overridden by a dysfunctional trade system that is rooted in unique superpower iii economic principles and not basic accounting or finance concepts i could go on about how many downgrades and poor design choices they made and i am trying not to complain too much about the glitches that can be hotfixed but i will end here

thank you for attending my ted talk

superpower 1 was one of the first games i fell in love with 
superpower 2 expanded on that game and polished it up 
    it had its share of bugs but it ended up being a fantastic game
superpower 3 it needs some serious patches 

here are the most problematic issues
1 unresponsive military units 
       unit counts incorrect at times
       no occupy territory option like in sp2

2 cant increase the game speed like in sp2

3 why cant we make treaties with multiple countries at once like in sp2
    also theres less options of what kinds of treaties you can sign

4 harder to navigate menus
   bring back sp2 smaller menus where you could have all 3 up at once
    less world view maps resource balance stability  etc and the ones you do have turn off as soon as you select a unit 

5 it says the character creator has serious effects on your game but it didnt seem like it made any difference to me

just fix #1 and the game will be playable
fix 24 and ill enjoy the game
idrc about the character creator thing though i appreciate adding new layers to the game

sincerely super fan since 2002




#####

i am really heartbroken as much as when i watched matrix 4so the game is that bad

#####

essentially ended up being a scam devs and publisher promised a lot and the result was a buggy and completely unfinished mess then proceeded to just abandon the game after almost no updates after all the hype for it my only regret is that i really tried to give the game a chance which put me over the 2 hour refund limit no reason to buy this at this point it was completely abandoned after almost no updates its around an early alpha level of development in its current state do not waste your money on this it is the epitome of what is frustrating a lot of people with gaming companies nowadays  unfinished buggy releases taken to the extreme in this case superpower 2 is pretty fun if old and has some interesting mods go buy that instead

#####

garbage game superpower 2 is better

#####

thq nordic should be ashamed of themselves allowing the release of this game in such state and not providing any kind of support to address the ton of issues other players have spoke about  its worse than what ea does sad that the legacy of superpower 2 is overshadowed by the shitty unplayable sequel

#####

i played superpower 2 for years and i absolutely loved it however superpower 3 is big disappointment i was expecting a superpower 2 with up to date data bugs fixed and maybe a couple of added features what we got was 
more bugs
less features
less information
slowest game ever
nonexistent game play

a lot of the things you could do or check in the previous one are not there anymore

that is the first review ive ever done on steam because i was maybe the biggest fan of superpower 2 and i was really excited when i saw that we were getting a superpower 3 but this game is so mediocre compared to the previous one that i couldnt not make a review it could have been something great but instead it is maybe the biggest disappointment ive had in video games

#####

doesnt teach you how to play cant choose your own political party map looks weird this looks like an early alpha build and should not have been released yet

#####

this game is like super power 2 but  and that is a big but  the developers forgot to finish the game  this should of never gotten released and should never of been called part 3 of anything  this is more like hey lets make a part 3 of our old game and forget to put 95 of the crap into it  oh and while we are at it lets keep most of the easy and must needed game features out of it  

  i really think this has to be one of the worse games i have ever purchased on steam and one of the worse releases anyone has delivered 

 lets hope they remember the customers and fix this crap

#####

trash

#####

dont waste your time or money i played for about 4 hours before writing this while playing i kept thinking that i just needed to play a bit longer to figure out how to do things partway through the 4th hour i realised that in fact there was nothing left to learn the game does not  give you much to do

the best part is that my money was refunded

#####

superpower 2 was much better  no idea what they were thinking when they made 3
the game is slow the ui is cheap  poorly done

very disappointed

#####

supershit 3

#####

dont just dont look for another game

#####

with what could have been a very excellent game is an utter failure ive tried multiple different trouble shooting attempts in order to make this game playable but it cannot be done i couldnt even imagine trying to play this game on a regular pc because on this high performance one i have this should be a cake walk the game forces you to use a laggy offsite server making it unplayable offline which would probably be the fix as im on 12g internet and their server cannot keep up dont spend your money on this huge disappointment

#####

lets call it what it is the game isnt nearly finished and the publisher wants to capitalise on the current global turmoil because everyone wants to see what happens if x country nukes y country

there is virtually nothing in the way of additional content added compared to superpower ii and although the graphics have been upgraded i would almost call it a downgrade because the menus take up the entire screen in some ways there is less features here you cant pick your political party so when im canada i have to be a bloody liberal and your decisions as a leader other than controlling your military seem to revolve around who can marry and whether or not women can have an abortion 

no tutorials and everything is considerably different from superpower ii in terms of how you use military adjust your sliders etc

so much missed opportunity for greatness and its buggy as hell for those expecting this to be fixed with patches keep in mind that superpower ii is still a mess but at least its enjoyable to play

#####

pretty disappointed after waiting for so many years why would anyone publish a game at this state

#####

garbage game  keeps crashing missing features many bugs  steam refuses to refund the game despite multiple attempts  avoid

#####

i have been around since day one 10 many many mistakes have been made with this game i mean alot of mistakes months went by with no bug fixes and little communication many patches came out and still it seemed only to get worse 

this game was totally abandoned last jan  its not finished nor is it playable as is its broken badly and i regret this purchase at this time


ps do not be a child a threaten people over a review you dont like that isnt cool nor is it ok

lacking content for the price many bugs

#####

the game is completely lifeless and many of the core features dont work or are poorly implemented likely bad priorities by the developers alternatively lack of effort andor funding should not sell for over 5 euros at this stage of development and ought to be considered early access they have some good ideas such as for the economy but failed to capitalize or properly implement most or any of them the choice to focus on character creation and customization and to market it as a game of conquest is telling of the possible lack of prioritization or interest on the part of the developers to actually make a decent simulation of geopolitics rather than something else time also runs at a crawling pace and the game has no tools for changing speed it seems they dont really know their audience

i actually fell asleep trying to play it and i say that as an avid statistics nerd and veteran of playing drawn out heavyweight political simulators that sometimes run even slower than this the game needs more work could be salvageable one day but would likely take a long time but if such a thing happens i might give it a new chance

#####

this is meant to be a relatively thorough review

i waited so damn long for a sequel to superpower 2 i wanted to like this game so bad but its completely void of things to do it needs an early access tag 

basically the only goals at the moment in this game are to

1 increase gdp  money by boosting resources such as fuel or gas or plants or cereals the assets here are really really limited it feels like there should be tons more basically the economy ui exists entirely in two different menus one of which has your taxes and budget the other has sectors you can invest in very lackluster

2 increase your army size by buying or building more units you can also research but this is limited simply to new levels of technology ie you cant change your units weaponry or customise them at all just make new unit designs with different tech levels affecting their cost to build again lackluster and not much content around it far more development needed to make this system interesting including unit customisation and research options beyond what is currently offered

3 invading other nations this links in to the above it feels very barebones ai is slow nothing really happens perse in the gameworld i played as australia and my units were for some reason in the sea near the phillipines nearly all of my navy i wasnt allied or even friendly with nations we are irl was incredibly off i declared war on and invaded new zealand and malaysia declared war on me 

that is all that happened no game events no immersion no world building even the combat and process of invading was boring no occupy all right click context command so you have to manually split units and put them into individual provinces so the enemy nation loses control of it at which point you annex it through your national legislation and laws menu or whatever it is 

its all very weird

some of the things in this game seem appealing such as the human development stat tracking but its all meat and no bones there is nothing backing all these flashy looking things to make them worthwhile

you cant build anything no new airbases no nothing in that form of gameplay 

the world map looks a bit unfinished in my opinion too

also bugs when launching the game forces full screen 7680x1440 i changed to windowed 1920x1080 and now upon opening the game again the next day it forced full screen and stretched 1920x1080 instead so now the ui is messed up and only two buttons are visible none of which are the settings to fix it thats great

overall not impressed i didnt refund it though potential is there and it was only 30

#####

guys dont waste your time and money on this
it has so many bugs and the frame rate is so poor that it almost kills the game also the gameplay itself has nothing interesting to show players

#####

superpower 2 was great even with its broken aspects 
this was bloody garbage and i am extremely disappointed 
they could have done so much better with this 
i was looking forward to this game and they let me down 
they let down the community as a whole too out of touch developers

#####

superpower 2 wasis a buggy terrible mess but even so i loved it as there is nothing else like it and it was at least playable this however is total bs i cant even get the correct resolution to work let alone save a single player game properly 

i am heartbroken at the death of the series

#####

ive been playing superpower 2 for years superpower 3 gave me a lot of hope because even when superpower 2 from 2004 is playable with mods today i thought superpower 3 would be awesome what were presented with is the worst game ive ever played congratulations to golemlabs and thq for destroying a game with such great potential moreover when all they had to do was edit superpower 2 add new content and publish it later i cant understand how they made a game that is sucks than a 20yearold game the game seems completely unplayable and unfixable as it is the game content sucks nothing good about ui game map is unrealistic and i wonder which world developers of this game live my advice to all players come back to superpower 2 do not spend any money on this game thq and golemlabs didnt do their due diligence and destroyed a game that could have been great i wish i could say otherwise applauds thq and gl

#####

the game is barely playable the ui is unresponsive and there are bugs everywhere the game is also overpriced for the currently avaiable content

#####

note for developer game runs my computer into the dirt i have a nvidia geforce rtx 2080 super 8gig plus 32 gigs of ram and my computer gets really hot i love the superpower game itself but i just cant risk letting my computer get destroyed because of performance issues if you guys can fix it ill rebuy it goodluck and thank you for always listening

#####

my first time buying a game on release also my last time buying a game on release this game is beyond trash ive never seen a game so empty they couldnt even be asked to add in different speed timers you have one speed time and thats it i only played 23 minutes and the best part of the time spent was in their good character creation but thats it nothing else is good every promotional pictures or video that doesnt showcase the character creation is a lie cant zoom into cities or anything else youre stuck seeing one map which is bland beyond believe i know superpower 2 was like this but cmon you gotta keep up with the tech of today no excuses

dont buy this trash game wait till i or someone else updates our reviews to give you better understanding if anything has changed

#####

not finished

#####

when i tried to make a chinese leader he looked like a white dude squinting his eyes

#####

after played this game for 4 hours my analisis is this is bad game no content lot of bugs too confusing even a mobile phone has more content and is better than this game do not buy it scam game

#####

i cant see them fixing this mess how tf are you gonna force a superpower to build one single order at a time who okd that you can literally only build 10k infantry at a time in a single order the ui is worse than sp2 in everyway i do not feel sorry for golemlabs one bit this will crush them especially after guild 3 this should have been a 10 early access title if they really needed revenue steam should honestly remove this crap from the store there also isnt a single server or person on multiplayer mode not one there is no way that this game is decent even a year from now imo i loved sp2 all you had to do is improve upon superpower 2 i am extremely disappointed hopefully steam refunds this one

#####

semifinished product
and there was no attempt to fix it
no update

#####

when i was a boy i was told that anybody could become president im beginning to believe it

now lets start the nuke party boy
peace was never an option devs

#####

well where do i start the game feels slow military units barely move properly city and town names wont appear camera controls are really weird the ai is weird moving troops into a region with no troops of another country still starts a war even though it shouldnt and many other issues the game just feels broken and buggy is it terrible well not exactly but right now it feels below average the new features are great problem is they dont really work a ferrari is great unless it has no wheels then its obviously not sp3 has a lot of potential and could be great but it has way to many serious bugs that must be fixed within the next week otherwise this game will flop i wont refund it but i think the devs have some explaining and fixing to do

one positive at least for now is the game looks pretty and they kept the globe if they genuinely apologise and fix all these game breaking bugs and the lag then ill make this review positive and recommend this game i cant do that now though honestly i hate to say this because i have so many great memories from sp2 and started playing it back in 2014 when i was 13 years old i really hope they fix things and improve the game because it has so much potential to be even better than sp2

#####

rushed release terrible game as a lifelong fan of superpower 1 and 2 this is just horrible someone lit a garbage truck on fire and this is it

#####

it really was a let down waited quite long for this game the trailer looked great but the gameplay lacked content

#####

okay so

first off the streaming of the game play yesterday did this title zero favours whoever made the decision to allow a copy of the game which was 400 builds behind to be live streamed made a mistake

the character creation is a nice touch makes you think and get involved with it characteristics of the nation you pick to play as i like this and rarely see stuff like this in game

the steam page states superpower 3 is tailormade for all the megalomaniacs out there who are convinced they can do a much better job at running the world than real politicians and military leaders across the globe thats a rather bold statement for a game that has 5 or 6 laws you can change for a whole country 

overall the game in its current state is incredibly basic and lacks any depth in regards to the actual management and running of a country no parliaments behind a leader etc why even the excuse of the focus is around you and your characters decisions doesnt make much sense it takes away the feeling of running a country that which you are describing in the games description where are the ministers the scandals that come with the running of a country

the game isnt a write off i personally feel it will be good in time but looks to be missing alot overall 510 product refunded

#####

even if they eventually fix all the bugs the problem with the game is that everything that is happening in the world is almost hidden from you  a world war could take place and unless its nuclear you wouldnt notice the number 1 issue with sp2 was that there wasnt much to do when you werent at war and this game makes that feeling of emptiness more prevalent 

the covert actions menu has delay the success percentages reset to the low complexity ones despite it keeping whatever you had last there i couldnt seem to lose diplomatic relations for hundreds of attacks on north korea nor did their approval rating shift in the slightest even though stability went from over 50 down below 10 coups didnt even work at 84 likelihood when stability was below 10 if you have multiple coups queued up but fail one they all get depleted

the nukes are so boring compared to sp2 the defcon  wargames inspired nuke menu was so special and ominous its like all personality has been stripped from this game

the military cant seem to move half the time if you want to give units to another nation well you have to go through 30 pages of units with only a few items each page and then youll find your latest purchase doesnt even show up anyway

this is not acceptable even if it were early access do yourself a favour and avoid

#####

imagine super power 2 but with worse graphics lag less features ugly 1 speed only and much more expensive and if you criticize it near any of the devs or their many goons you can expect a ban or mute

#####

i am was a huge fan of superpower 2 and actually purchased it multiple times because i found it so fun  my anticipation for this release was probably greater than others so despite the warnings i went ahead a purchasedbig mistake  

the game is unplayable period  

the graphics are poor at best  sp2s map could zoom in closer and was more detailed

the military aspects are a joke  nothing works properly

i would have preferred just an updated version of sp2 then this dumpster fire  sadly disappointed

#####

neeeds a lot of optimalization there are missing assets and it feels like rushed product without serious testing sp2 was a masterpiece but even after 20 minutes i can see that this is not a worthy successor hopefully they will patch it up

#####

very disappointed  sp2 is more far better that this game please uptade sp2 with 2022 information and it will be ok 

update 112022  

i test it for free to avoid paying a high price for an unfinished game once the defects are corrected i will buy it too bad to have only 2 hours of play to test such a game

in short im currently testing version 103 and its a real disaster the game is simply not finished there is so much information missing

 the comparison by map it is colorful but very difficult to read especially since there is no classification with figures for example i know that my hdi is high but how much exactly
 where is the gdp growth rate
 military units take too long to respond and the way to control them is not intuitive its simple though left click to select and right click to move this system has been around for 30 years
 the data is sometimes inconsistent im starting with a poor country that has 80 billion in aid i think its his budgetrecipe but it bothers me that its in foreign aid
 military ships absolutely do not correspond to reality sp is in real simulation not approximations like gps3
 during a war countries have 30 allies when in reality not really eg morocco its absurd
 agérie with floréal  class frigates pt76 tanks and only 3 submarines against 6 real
 purchased units that remain blocked

in short take sp2 as an example and add things instead of removing them

i want to test the game and give you regular feedback on the condition of having it for free if i would wait until it is finished to buy it maybe in 2030 lol

#####

the interface runs extremely poorly even on the lowest settings on a good system and the game on pause
good luck building more units as you wait ten minutes for the super long and jumbled mess of a unit selection list to load

its a hollow mimicry of the old superpower games

fix all these various issues people are griping about and ill consider coming back with my money for now i have requested a refund i was so excited after all these years only to be met with this hot garbage spent an hour of my time just waiting for the interface to respond to my commands every button press and slider was an agonizing trudge through the sludgiest ui i have seen in modern times

#####

devs are working on the game good patches so far  but still lacking content
the complex game mechanis will never work with simple  sliders or simple investments in random production sectors changing laws has almost no influence on gameplay they should take a look at power and revolution to get some ideas what they should change to make gameplay more interesting

#####

game is completely fucking borked

literally tried my best to destroy russia and nothing happened to my approval or stability bugs are still there performance issues its exactly what we hoped wouldnt happen

do not buy unless the update it later on extremely disappointed

edit idk if its a bug but i cant even fucking zoom in the game is just unplayable man

#####

first and foremost if you want to see some real gameplay and take a legitimate look at this game then check out the review i put up on my youtube channel link below

but this game is pretty bad i know that a bunch of other people already gave this a bunch of awful reviews and thats because the game deserves it this is my first entry into the superpower games and it was not a good one

the game is broken in so many ways its hard to list them all its missing in so much content that it feels empty or super early access

scroll up real quick look at the advertisements for the game see those dont they look cool theyre not in the game at all and the game is nothing like the advertisements its basically like a boardgame without turns half the time your commands dont work half the time nothing you do matters at all i conquered mexico and no one in the world cared it was a pointless nonsensical invasion with no real reason and my approval rating actually went up by 3 percent and the rest of the world didnt notice or care

the game wouldnt let me use nukes when i scrolled in i only got a vague shadow picture of my troops and couldnt see cities at all apart from the cutscenes there are no sound effects and no other voice acting the only thing you get is simple background music the game doesnt let you choose which political party you belong to the game doesnt let you make a lot of choices and even then youre choices seemingly dont matter to anything i was able to get america out of debt increase my approval rating and  completely take over another country and there were zero consequences for any of my reckless actions to get us that far andit only took a couple of clicks to completely improve my country in every way possible

the game is missing so much and its so buggy that its more annoying than fun to play pass on this one either pass on it completely or come back in a year or two after some serious updates if youre new to the series then just run away as fast as you can this super complicated confusing game offers no tutorials and no teaching to help you learn how to play
if youre a fan of this title come back in a year when it has more content and less bugs okay everyone

thanks so much for reading and i hope i helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely

i cannot express just how disappointed and sad i am about this game i have been playing superpower 2 since 2005 and even to this day i consider that game one of the best games ever created even if it did have a few bugs so having waited 17 years for superpower 3 i had high hopes for this game however superpower 3 is a real real let down i dont know where to start 

1 it looks like a game if you can call it a game which was put together in a complete rush with not much time or energy invested into it
2 the game is extremely boring there is literally nothing to do once you set your budget sliders which are also awful as they are clunky theres not much else to do but sit
3 there is only 1 set game speed and its super slow
4 you cant even zoom in to the ground as show in their videos the camera stops zooming in at a certain point
5 you cant tilt the camera
6 the military is full of bugs
7 there are hardly any internal laws you can effect
there are so many more things i can say but i would be here all night trying to list them

this game should not have been released in its current state even if it was an alpha testing game i would say it would be too soon never mind actually releasing the game

i have tried so hard to love this game but i just cant its boringgggg

the sad thing is the developers didnt actually need to make drastic changes to sp2 they could have just tweaked it added in a few more features and sorted the bugs out called it sp3 and i would have loved it but what they have mashed together here is just awful
best thing the developers could do now is close the game refund eveyone and just go back to sp2 and focus on releasing a dlc or something for that we dont need better graphics we need better gameplay sp2 graphics were perfect

perhaps the developers will engage more with us fans of sp2 before they make a sp4 in 20 years time

so disappointed moral of the story to anyone reading this is dont waste your money on this game as it currently is buy superpower 2 instead

#####

i really wanted to like this game i am a big fan of sp2 i have to agree with others that the game appears to be unfinished i was running into issues with a few different scenarios

 appears to be a memory leak as the game started to use up 18 gb of ram after 2 hours of game play
 unemployment appears to have a bug in it at times i had a strong education system to train my workforce in the different tiers and it never went down
 there does appear to be a bug with asking big countries for money i was able to continuously ask the usa for 500 bn very often without complaint
 the gdp doesnt increase in value when you put investment into sectors it went down in some cases even when heavily invested
 no inflation control this was well done in sp2
 foreign aid doesnt appear to work
 unable to disband military units you can only sell them
 moving military units around is rather clumsy it was well done in sp2
 you are unable to see what treaties other countries have with each other like sp2
 unable to create more elaborate treaties to match a more realworld scenario

#####

i really disliked the game mechanics some of the sliders were not even working some of the markeds that i invested in did not update the production of goods over time even if they ran for months then suddenly they updated can not reccomend this game in its current state i requested and received a refund

#####

game takes 15 minutes to load on linux using protonge 
high ram usage  crashes after awhile bad performance in general

ui is confusing and big


original review 7 oct

stuck on loading screen on linux using protonge

cant even judge the game when i literally cant even start a game

#####

a game with so much potential in an untapped and woefully underpopulated genre falls

really hurts to say but this is not worth it yet it has a vast quantity of potential but it just isnt there it feels like an early alpha and nowhere near viable for release

maybe in a year or so yes i think it will take that long it will be worth it but right now in its current state i cant recommend such a shame

devs please dont give up keep working  it can be a great game eventually just not yet

#####

just save your time and money and dont buy the game victoria 3 comes out later this month and is going to be a far better game than whatever this is i spent half an hour trying to figure out how to fire nukes as that was half the appeal of superpower 2 i cant tell you how much i loved pressing that red button in superpower 2 yet i couldnt even figure out how to do that

just save yourself the money and buy victoria 3 youll be happier trust me

#####

very disappointed the game run very slowly is almost unplayable

#####

id never played a superpower game before but heard the series was a good place to go for political simulators saw this was launching and decided to give it a go only to spend my time being confused as what to do
you are only given control over halfadozen laws and nothing is explained in an intuitive matter like when you start in civilization 6
i can not recommend this game but will give superpower 2 a try in the future

#####

very poor game need a massive update

#####

biggest letdown of the year what a travesty

beyond the myriad of problems like ui and controls lies a game that doesnt even function properly

#####

the game has potential but just not ready yet to be out lagging numerous glitch when spying you dont see what you get being told that you have lost region when nothing is happening trying to move unit is challenging battles are really not up to part just too soon


#####

as a fan of the first first game i am ashamed that i had faith they would fix this game after launch this game should be mass refunded and removed from steam

#####

currently pending refund horrible game

#####

my expectations were lowbut wow

#####

a huge dissapointment

#####

so excited about the release disappointed while playing

#####

refunded this game the community tried to warn you thq and golem labs not to release this in the state its in the fact that you havent even patched this thing yet is a terrible way to handle business at least dream catcher back in the day allowed a working copy of the game to be released seems like a thq rushed hunk of shit i suppose there are only so many words in the dictionary that can be used to describe how awful of shape this game is in

#####

short version i played hundreds of hours of sp1 and sp2 and have been waiting for this given my admittedly limited game time i cannot in good conscience recommend this game in this state avoid it at least for now 

long version when the best the positive steam reviews can manage is it has potential it should have been a red flag almost as much of a red flag as how quickly it went from coming soon to oct 7 release it does have potential but i dont buy games hoping for them to one day be worth playing 

some of it is minor bugs like flag textures going missing some of it is design decisions like not being able to queue military units to be built or ridiculous taxes on commodities less than 1 on us energy for real 

the simple fact is the game seems not only rushed but dumbed down from previous versions its got a fancy new interface with no guidance on where things are i cannot imagine how players who havent played previous versions are even trying to figure out what to do given the only thing resembling a tutorial are 3 youtube videos linked on the opening splash screen 

this might pass as an early access as a full release its insulting

#####

i am lost for words

#####

i feel scammed lets see if they fix it along the way

#####

not even close to superpower 2
runs like garbage on modern hardware
textures missing
time cant be forwarded
server connectivity issues on launch day preventing even single player

conclusion
dont buy this game

#####

pretty disappointing  i got to compare it to #2  longer load times assuming it doesnt lock up on load which is over 50 of the time for me  the menu is less intuitive  the sliders worker poorly  no improvement in graphics  less treaties you can do with other countries  and if you manage to do a treaty theres no actual list to show you your on going treaties  which is a major issue as they cost money and balancing a budget is a major part of the game  yeah you got character design but i havent seen that character once i play the game making the whole process a waste of time  the menus show less information

i had such high hopes for this game and it has no improvements over the 2nd  overall all aspects of the game are either equal to or below the 2nd game  so i see no reason to keep this on my pc and will uninstall it and reinstall 2 soon as im finished writing this review

in a year ill comeback and check if the updates made it a better game like no man sky or cyberpunk 2077 redeemed themselves

#####

it took 15 years for them to make a broken mobile game it looks horrible and plays horrible the nukes look like trash you cant see units nothing makes sense doesnt tell me what is happening and nothing seems to work do not buy 

they should have just taken sp2 and upgrade the graphics

#####

the game is too buggy for such a simplistic gameplay devs have disappeared and patches created more problems than the scratch

#####

this company knew they were releasing an unfinishedunpolished game i do understand however that the bosses upstairs are all about meeting deadlines still have hope for the future of this game via updates

#####

i have one thing to say even though they are slightly different games in context look at terra invicta look at super power iii

thats itthats the review

#####

game sucks you should be ashamed of yourselves 20 years in the making for what 

cant go to war zero options on policy like what the heck was going on in the planning room 

do us a favor and remove the trash from steam issue a formal apology to all your loyal supporters and get out of the gaming business 

very very very disappointed

#####

i used to play superpower 2 alot a decade ago superpower 3 is just a dissapointment i cant recommend this to anyone it feels like a cheap smartphone game refunded

#####

this game sets in the year current year
you play as a young game tester on a quest to test a very early version of a newly released game resembling superpower 2 

when you press download steam contacts some storage servers to download all the files from a game build

the game is made in unreal engine 4 and captures every aspect of an early access v001 beta demo game the mouse is working and can be moved freely over the entire resolution of the screen and there are menus like multiplayer and settings there is no doubt that this is a game project files download music has been added

is is also possible to start a game and you can test the various active elements the game is a view of planet earth which can be rotated and it is partitioned into countries which are clickable clicking a country will open up a set of rough looking menus

clicking the elements rotating and sliding stuff is fun for a while then it gets boring but maybe it will be fun if you play the game after a pause i am not sure about this 

thats all this is the review ok

#####

superpower 2 is much much better

#####

unable to fire nukes unable to design troops and build troops do not work you get no tutorial so youre guessing half the time on what to do but cant tell if what youre doing is wrong or if the game has bugged out and not working at all do not buy until they fix it

#####

a big scam

#####

i played more than 3 different countries with more than 5 different times and all of them i could not play more than half an hour or an hour with a lot without the game crashed up and getting me out in addition to that my game that i spent more than half an hour playing is not saved who fixes all problems

#####

its just a spit in my face from the developer i havent bought such a hack for a long time requested a refund golemlabs just be closed please

#####

i cannot recommend this game at all its so bad it didnt take long for me to consider getting a refund

#####

unfortunatelly the game seems half cooked
very slow and poor gameplay experience

also it doesnt look real at all politics or economy

some examples
 increasing government expending reduces corruption hello in which country this happens  maybe in denmark because any other country that money will specifically go to corruption

#####

this game just looks and feels incredibly broken playing it trying to do basically anything from selecting units to working with the unit designer and attempting diplomatic interactions it just doesnt work i struggle to understand how a publisher like thq could greenlight this game for launch one of the most disappointing games ive ever bought super power needs a true sequel

#####

buggy as hell lacking many superpower 2 features wait a year and it might be worth buying

#####

h1 strikegreatstrike ok sequel for an strikegreatstrike ok franchise h1

let me just preface this review by saying i have only played the superpower series from 2010 onward specifically superpower 2 between 20102013 i used to host a roleplay server that was usually called wills rp server ill start out by recalling problems i had with superpower 2 that game was an imperfect mess it had a lot of bugs and i dont recall a single patch being released until it was brought to steam in 2014 or whenever that was however a lot of those bugs had workarounds and there was a small modding community out there that fixed a lot of issues cough uberfox cough and superpower 2 was unique in that the host could use a mod but the players would not need to have that mod in order to play on the server only certain mods bugs and other gameplay issues aside the most fun i derived out of the multiplayer games was from social interaction and just genuinely great rp from the communityplayers i think it was an entertaining experience for most players especially with mods i understand people enjoy superpower in different ways but i just wanted to give some background and my perspective before i give my thoughts on superpower 3

starting out with graphics obviously a decent jump in graphical quality which pretty much should be a given in 2022 unless youre rereleasing power and revolution again in saying that its not all improved visual clarity is lowered by the clouds and night time and if you disable them you have to look at a pretty lacklustre water texture  not good thematic maps and resource filters are just a pain to visually decipher sometimes despite what they have changed with patches

like other reviewers have stated autarky is still a thing and the economic gameplay features and functions seem to have been reduced compared to superpower 2 economic statistics sometimes seem to be completely unrealistic and military placements and numbers wildly inaccurate military research for individual countries is wrong and outdated for many countries even for 2018 not having airbases a la power  revolution and instead using airports is interesting but also just unrealistic only being able to build one military unit at a time is both unrealistic and a step backwards from the sp2 system it seems they have made a lot of arbitrary choices about what to be realistic about and what not  probably for simplicitys sake

there are many other problems and gameplay issues i have encountered over the 100 hours i have played so far which has been mostly on multiplayer but many other reviewers have already listed a lot of those in their own reviews so i will just say that the 3 or 4 patches that golemlabs have released so far have improved this game drastically since release and that from the perspective of an old sp2 player at this point the game could probably be regarded as barely playable i wouldnt really expect gl to work too much more on this considering their track record which is fine but they will probably continue on with it for a while yet which is great for those who decided to stick it out or people considering playing again or even purchasing it but my hope is that when modders start to create things and fix issues this game could probably be near the level of sp2 fun albeit with a few less innate features

my recommendation is that if youre not a hardcore fan of the series you probably wont enjoy it in its current state but i would 100 recommend it on sale if people buy it on sale the player base might start to return and grow sowing the seeds for a future community similar to superpower 2

#####

very buggy and overall a huge disappointment

#####

after superpower 2 this is a total disappointment there is no purpose in this game you just set some sliders to decide on your policies and wait for time to pass nothing ever happens thereafter i wouldnt even call this a game what a shame that they released it like this dont waste your time and money on this

#####

sadly very disappointed here is why i got a refund basic unit types like artillery  drones apcsifvs are just missing 
a lack of sprites to have as units on the map all units of a generation look the same very very lazy 
only 7 internal laws budget sliders take 23 seconds to respond 
11 speed in the game 
so pathing does units is nonrational you order a unit to go from toronto to buffalo and the unit goes south to the middle of lake erie and south of buffalo then north to buffalo 
aircraft just hover in the war zone and shoot at a target 
warzone mechanic works 5 of the time

#####

terrible sht game had potential dev team abandoned it

 just buy icbm

#####

id call this game shit but i dont want be insulting to shit the only thing shit ever did to me was stink

#####

great idea stupid game

i thought the studio learn something from paradoxs stupid works and geopolitical simulator 4unfortunately the game even do not show the charm of superpower 2 so far
i am not sure how much players counted down to superpower 3s debut at least i did then problems followed why i cant have dropdown list why i cant control the speed why i found rare demography elements in the game why there are no random events for choose technology tree
i will not ask for refund i suppose you spent times and you are not as lazy as paradox still i can not totally accept the work worse than realpolitiks2 actually it is a good game
its 4 am i can not believe what a terrible game i just played yet you ruined it firstly but never again please

i noticed mentioned victoria 3 if the latter sucks too i will feel like 2022 is the worst year i experience ever
please fix it at once
i was preparing for license exam you destroyed it for giving me unrealistic expectations
i am here to recapture her lost youth with the game but find i am a useless guy in the 30s

well someone asked me why i mentioned notorious paradox here
firstly because their major games are basically colouring games yes you coloured the world map with your owned colour simple but cool at least i did it when i was playing superpower 2 but i suspect if i can have such fun in sp3 so setting a hollow victory goals is really important for the players
in the second place paradoxs games did debut with several bugs but these bugs are tolerant only if the hollow victory goals exist why gandhis nukes rather than game itself became a joke among civ players think twice
last some games including superpower 2 changed players appetite if you can not cater for picky players then curses come

how the developers matter the avatars but turn a blind eye to players main need gosh why i do not play the sims instead i beg your reconsideration wish your repair could make the game great again

i can not help to try again since the first fix released then my happiness paused to find i can not restart the game within 3 min

#####

extremely buggy and doesnt seem notably different than superpower 2

others mentioned the sliders being an issue theyre very difficult to select and only pick up about half the time and lag on movement i had some trouble switching between countries i encountered two visual glitches during my brief 40 minute game as the uk probably about 20 minutes of actual gameplay the rest was loading screens

the fact that the presidents lips dont start moving until a few seconds after when he is talking in the promo video should give you a good idea into the quality of the game just play superpower 2 until this spends some more time in the development oven

#####

game is dead development team abandoned this game awhile back dont waste your money

#####

pretty bad was kinda looking forward to this one refunded

#####

nonexistent game play

#####

so much potential yet falls so short a rushed game released too early

full of bugs awful ui lackluster ai missing treaty system i could go on but theres no point

give this game a few months and see if updates have helped the game  but right now i have to say do not buy

thqn got greedy such a disappointment  a genuine downgrade from sp2

#####

this game is beyond broken and featureless at the moment i hope they will add to the game soon and i will definitely revisit if they do but the game in its current state is unacceptable please dont buy until further notice from the developers

#####

this game was truly terrible

#####

empty and unfinished nothing more to say

#####

idk man was really excited for this game but at release it is a reskin of sp2 while missing some features and being more buggy there are a few cool new features but right now its just not worth the 30 until they release a lot more content and bug fixes in patches 

#####

completely unplayable units eventually stop moving or attacking during war the images and graphics of units disappear are replaced with a white boxerror game is very slow and laggy there is no tutorial i had to get a refund the devs need to fix this before ill consider buying it thank god for steam refunds

update 10 november 2022 after many updates this game is still broken and unplayable needs many more months of fixes definitely not worth 30

update 30 december 2022 i give up game is busted beyond repair devs have gone silent too do not support this

#####

i wanted to like this game so bad i even set my expectations to being glad if it was just super power 2 reskinned i truly would have been okay with that but no it somehow takes about 20 gb to install for what there is no content the ui is broken theres no way to improve your relations with other countries and if there is theres no way of being able to tell no international organizations like the un or nato at least none that i could find it took me almost 3 hours to figure out how to launch nukes all the while running terribly and decently intermittently making it extremely annoying to do anything specially when youre trying to explore the planet the graphics are okay not being able to select your political ideology but rather it be established based off your created character was an interesting idea but ultimately failed it made it feel even emptier than what the game is and its pretty bare boned like i said i really wanted to like this game i set my expectations low and was still somehow extremely disappointed i never write bad reviews like ever i am one of those weird xennials that was raised to not say anything if theres nothing nice to say 

but i was also raised to stand up for myself and i legit feel robbed i may come back in a few months and check on the game to see if its been updated and hopefully recieves some intensive updates like cyberpunk to fix this game but for now i could not in good faith recommend anyone to buy this game in its current state i had hoped for so many years that there would be a sequel to super power 2 and when i saw there was going to be one i can not even describe how excited i became which probably attributes to the level of disappointment i felt after buying this i really hope that i get the requested refund if steam denies it and sees how poorly rated this game is i will never buy directly from steam again probably use epic gog xbox game pass ea ubisoft connect and any games on steam will be purchased from third party sites like greenmangaming etc

#####

victoria 3

#####

the worst game ever i have been waiting for more than 10 years dont buy it

#####

abandoned i had such high hopes but they decided profit was the only thing that matters and not legacy

#####

i was not even able to play the game everytime try to open it it disconnected from the server and gives me this error eloginclient failed  i tried every possible troubleshooting and nothing changed may be it was good to stop at this stage to avoid being more disappointed and frustrated the reviews are all incredibly negative i cannot believe i have waited for almost a year since the game was announced such companies need to be embargo from steam

enough playing with our minds

#####

 broken ui elements
   missing national flag graphics during battle
   unit movement trails never clear
   units sporadically invisible
 no informational overlay maps of any kind
 cant tell whats happening in battle areas
 cant zoom in very far at all not even as far as the screenshots show
 no option to change political party or make serious changes to form of government much shallower than superpower 2

reeks of development crunch sorry golemlabs but i dont know what happened with this one ill check back in on you in a few months okay

#####

this is the worst ive seenshame on the company get this game right

#####

too many bugs battle system cannot even compare to ck2 cannot do anything about economy except tax cannot print money diplomacy is so bad mapmode ui design is just like 20 years ago if you are a really like strategic game paradox is far more better than this also heart of irion is better than this game even in economy and polictics area
this game is waste your time and money

list

#####

this game really does seem incredibly rushed especially the military system i still think it could become much better with frequent updates but to release it in this state was definitely a mistake imho id say keep an eye on it and dont rule it getting better out just yet ill change my review to a thumbs up if it does get better

#####

in short until it is fixed avoid it

i annexed baja california as america peacefully and although that caused mexico to go to war with me they did not actually make an effort to defend their country nor did the rest of the world react according to the bugged diplomatic relations view so i have to think the ai is broken i honestly preferred looking at the plain battle menu from sp2 than the laggy clusterfk that it is now i cant even comprehend whats going on most of the time even so much as adjusting your budget sliders causes the game to slow to a crawl the mp server list is broken and i cant find games because they appear for a second then just vanish how can they mess up something as crucial to superpower as multiplayer icons missing the game ui not caring what you put in the character creator crashes there is also a server application that launches with the game that eats your resources worse than joshua_server ever did 

the list goes on and on and these are the things i noticed in the first hour dont buy it

#####

i hope you did a mistake and gave us an early build

the sliders are laggy the whole game doesnt perform well it also progresses slowly because of the speed it has in my opinion
windows resolution cant change
some values like birth rate and death rate wont change in my experience


#####

i rarely write reviews and i hate to jump on the hate train for this game but it really isnt great  i played sp2 and when people started saying that sp3 wasnt fun because it lacked gameplay i defended sp3 because sp2 doesnt really have gameplay and was clunky so it just seemed to sound like the previous one to me  however after giving sp3 a go i cant recommend it and have refunded the game  there are bugs like i couldnt hit the play button on the weird character creation screen why this screen exists is beyond me because i never saw my character in game some sliders seem useless the menus are clunky time has one pace seriously why this was done blows my mind you cant choose your political party etc
the last one is particularly confusing to me in a political sim that now has a full blown character builder you cant select your political party  should your party have a big influence on how you play probably not but it still would allow you the creative freedom to be you i wanna like this game but i just cant  i hope they fix it and maybe in the future i will be willing to give it another go but for now i say wait  this is probably the end to a series that i thought was already dead but probably definitely will be now

#####

steaming dumpster fire

#####

i think a video game published should be at least playable there are way too many bugs and crashes

#####

the previous game in the series is ahead in most aspects i think the improvements made are not good enough to level up the game i cant say its a complete disappointment because i dont think they will leave the game like this but i did not expect such a result

#####

102019

ps i wish nuclear weapons worked

#####

super power 3 is my first entry into the series and sadly it is not leaving a great impression

pros
 great character creator
 a lot of real life situations to play
 people got mad when i attacked canada as the should

cons
 no tutorial with a steep learning curve
 the graphics were glitching out a lot on my play through
 had several boot up errors

i really thought i might like this game as ive been getting into the rts games and like economy management but this just seemed like it wasnt ready for release i give it 15 economic downfalls

#####

i really loved the second superpower and even with the bad reviews wanted to try the 3rd not worth it when they say runs bad they mean it your population continuously gets more and more unemplyed you can invest billions and trillions into economy and it wont change like its just a flawed unfinished part of the game soldiers and battles make no sense and you randomly get messages about iceland annexing ireland or provinces being taken over or your territories being annexed but its just glitches and nothing is happening this game isnt just unfinished its absolutely flawed to the core the entire deomographics wich is 1 of the 4 parts of this game is soo soo flawed your population will either skyrocket or emmigrate nomatter what you choose as desicisions based on whatever the game predetermined it would do trade with other nations and treaties dont work either except embargo however it isnt even listed as embargo its a trade deal wich you only realize is embargo the opposite when you realise the other country hates you for it you cant actualyl tell from the economy tab however since its glitched and makes no difference

through a quick online search you can find out this game is abandoned half finished in a alpha not even beta stage the company knew it was trash and released it anyways to make back the funds it lost in the little development they started and there are tons of messages online in many forums about how even though the company promised to fix the glitches after the release with the funds i guess it thought it would make from the release the actual employees say they gave up quit didnt do it etc due to absolutely terrible salaries among others 

do not buy this game you may as well throw your money down the drain even downloading it the simple dfownload glitched and crashed steam 4 times for me thats some never before seen levels of glitchy

#####

game is a broken bugged mess the silence to any criticism speaks volumes from golem labs and thqnordic

#####

hello sp3 developers

we are writing to you to ask that you please fix our game we have been playing it for a while and it is really fun but there are some issues that need to be fixed

first of all the game keeps crashing we have tried everything to fix it but it still happens it is really frustrating and we hope you can fix it soon

secondly the graphics are not the best they are not terrible but they could be better we would love to see some updated graphics in the game

lastly the controls are a bit wonky they work but they are not as responsive as we would like we hope you can fix this so that we can enjoy the game even more

additionally we feel that the character creation feature is unnecessary in this game it takes up time and adds nothing to the gameplay experience it would be great if this feature could be removed or streamlined

thank you for your time and we hope you can fix these issues soon we really enjoy playing your game and we appreciate your hard work

#####

as someone who played the predecessor superpower 2 for over a thousand hours

this game whilst impressive in some regard visually is very poor

the map looks like a paradox game with all the 3d buildings a large deviation from the previous game which just used dots on the map which i significantly dislike

the controls are incredibly clunky i couldnt even defeat taiwans military after nuking it with 16 icbms as china and fully occupying and annexing the country what why are random helicopters and submarines still alive makes zero sense to me

the ui is exaggerated and too large superpower 2 was very quick and even dare i say simple compared to this the layout is just too confusing here

you can only build one unit design at once china which has one of the largest shipbuilding industries and largest steel industries in the world can only build 10 destroyers and nothing else not tanks not missiles not infantry at the same time at once

there is no actual content ai actions and decisions seem to be random theres no event feed like in sp2 so you cant really tell whats going on

lots of world leaders are no joke just named john and jane doe why do so many cultures lack names this game was marketing itself on its character creation and demographics

superpower 2 is significantly stronger gameplay wise and design wise than this hollow corporate money grab shell of a game

im not developing mods for this not until it gets significant patches


#####

cyberpunked

#####

i waited 14 years and ruined my childhood memories for this bugged out garbage

fix your game

#####

this makes cyberpunk look great and even ignoring all the glitches the political bias is real for example only 2 irish socialist parties and no communist party in ireland a country where 20 of the votes go to such parties absolutely pathetic reflection of political bias on a video game the leader you create is a civ 6 style immortal deity that rules the country for thousands of years if you played for that long no one can replace him as head of the party speaking of the party you cant even chose which party you start as

the game itself is broken it runs like crap and there is no way to limit fps so my gpu runs like crazy and the game runs slow the ai just doesnt work the game has no tutorial and it came out with zero information on the game or how to even play it the features that do work slightly are just copypasted from super power 2 so im unimpressed there but yet somehow superpower 2 still works better also the camera constantly glitches out and you cannot move units unless you are at war so when war happens you just have to let the enemy occupy your land before your units get to the border also when you play egypt and start as a white guy with asian clothes and a french military hat named john doe by default it kinda breaks the immersion and tells you not only how unpolished the game is but how basic it is right away the devs straight up lied about their advanced mechanics which dont even work how was this released

when i said cyberpunk had a better release i genuinely meant it this game is prealpha at best thats what it feels like honestly just play superpower 2

#####

make numbers go up or down while you watch slowly as nothing of note happens

#####

very saddening i have played phone games with better ui and functionality

#####

overpriced and overhyped

#####

does not even hold a candle to superpower 2
i understand it may still be in development but it was worse than my worst expectations
the game is also so laggy as though it requires rtx or something

#####

man i was refreshing this page over and over on launch day waiting on it what a disappointment

#####

i loved sp i loved sp2 i went into this knowing that the sp series was always leaning more in the direction of geopolitical wargames with little domestic politics and diplomacy and even so this is just wow

as a tech demo a pre or early alpha this would have shown a lot of potential but as a finished game no way and i am not talking about no mans sky style lack of content  there is nothing resembling a serious gameplay loop here i used to be a voluntary tester for other grand strategy games by another publisher and let me tell you their earliest test releases had a lot more going on than this released game

ill add a few issues i posted about in the community forum just to illustrate what kinds of issues i am talking about

1 the world feels very passive it doesnt seem like the ai is doing much or that theres even an ai at all someone else reported the ai not responding even to a nuclear attack and i can confirm that

2 that leads into the other major issue information the game does not give you any meaningful information about whats going on around the world and if it does its just a very dry small notification on the respective area of the screen if youre used to paradox titles where theres always something happening somewhere in the world and you can follow along this is not doing a great job

3 add ot that lack of meaningful information about your own nation the game tells you that unemployment is due to population groups preferring to work in industries that are underdeveloped but it doesnt tell you which population groups or which industries in general you dont get a very good idea of what is going on in your country making it really hard to make informed decisions

this also affects diplomacy good luck finding out where the game shows you another countrys opinion of yours and good luck figuring out if another country is likely to accept your proposal or what your proposal even does diplomacy is technically there but is not usable at all

4 finally ive noticed theres a distinct lack of customization which is baffling because they spent all the dev time on choosing a hat for my avatar but i cant even name or choose my party i can however name treaties and unit designs a feature i dont think works reliably right now but id rather be able to change information about my country such as its name or getting really crazy here flag

5 oh and on another footnote yes theres only one game speed no pause is not bound to space and most irritatingly typing eg when naming the aforementioned treaties triggers camera movement so the game doesnt even lock keyboard input to a text box when editing one thats easily fixed but screams rushed like little else

#####

its trash

#####

exactly what everyone else said

#####

wowall i can say is complete and utter hot garbage

superpowers 2 was one of my all time faves

this is just a complete joke  my brother and i were amped to play thisnostalgia was hitting hard  we counted down the hours and bought it the moment it released

we have no idea what anything doesactions have zero consequencesthe only notifications ive seen from other countries are things like sudan is moving politically to the righti invaded and annexed mongolia with zero repercussions or any kind of murmur from the rest of the world

the combat is a complete jokeyou have no idea whats going onshit glitches all over the place and theres no way to tell whats going on in a battle

finally we realized the game was just completely stuck on a day and not moving forwardit wasnt paused  so i tried to save and backout but the game wouldnt let me savethen it wouldnt let me back out

wtf  how can a developer release a game like this  this has to be some kind of scam

never been this disappointed in a title

#####

garbage just like sp3 nothing more than a glorified world map with a few screens bolted on literally nothing ever happens in the game move a few sliders around and watch some figures go up and down thats about it 

seriously save your money folks

#####

sadly nothing currently works also had 2 crashes while trying to start it single player doesnt work neither does mp i hope they fix it either im gonna refund this next week

#####

i am leaving a negative review for now because the game can easily be fixed and i believe it will be what made sp2 great was the complete accuracy of the economy simple ui where you could simply see a bar of full numbers either red or green to analyze how well your nation is doing however in sp3 there is none of that no colour no big number just rounded up blank white numbers that mean nothing i have absolutely no clue how to manage the economy which is bad because sp2s economy was terrifyingly hard to grasp which i believe will be an absolute nightmare for new players who have never heard of this series before and have never touched the economy aspect of the game another issue i had is the complete flooding of screens again what was better in sp2 was that everything was nice and small and easy to navigate nothing ever jumped out at you and made you completely confused and for my final note is that the game is terrifyingly terrible in the war aspect when i takeover a territory i do not actually know what i have taken because apparently that aspect needed to be removed there is no highlight to what i have taken moving units is also especially hard i can no longer drag to move units again why that aspect was removed i will never know the game will however be fixed in my opinion if youre looking for a modern version of hoi4 i believe this game suits you however this is not in the hearts of iron series this is a superpower game and i believe the devs need to realize this

#####

completely broken and unplayable everything everyone feared it would be

#####

too many bugs game keep crashing in multiplayer

#####

i really wanted this to work but all we got was another cyberpunk early release pile of disappointment tbh this is just embarrassing you would need a factory of polish to fix this mess sp 2 is far superior and it was released in 2004 and is just over a gb and yet with a more modern engine they made this worse 

#####

like superpower 2 but worse in every aspect
just a shameless moneygrab 

#####

usually i am a quiet buyer if i buy and like a game  i dont write about it if i buy and dont like a game  i dont write about it but this game forced me to write my first ever review as i cannot stay quiet after investing 2699  for an absolutely broken softwarei really cannot even call it a game at the moment it seems unfinished or it is just scam because it is not what the trailers show it is incredibely full of bugs and glitches which you encounter all the time as if nobody ever tried to test it before release there are even problems with simple functions like clicking on a country i have waited for this game a long time but unfortunately i can only confirm all the other negative reviews

if it wouldnt be enough there is also a lack of knowledge about some countries slovakia does not speak slovenian it speaks slovak when you create a character in slovakia you cannot even choose slovak for slovakia it chooses slovenian if you bring out a geopolitical game you should at least know the differences between countries that sound similar for you 

dear developers please change my mind about this game because at the moment its absolutely unplayable and not worth the download even if it would be freeware

update 04032023
after 5 months there are no real fixes so this game is a scam golemlabs and thq nordiq took my money for a broken software

#####

waste of time too many bugs and hard to use combat functionalities

#####

iam heavily disappointed

#####

golem labs  games that think developers who obviously didnt

#####

really poor game buggy refunded

#####

while the devs have been updating the game with patches every week the patches have led to glitches happening often or all the time  for example the economy if you start with a gdp or 300 b reguardless of what you spend in each sector the gdp stays at 300 b plus you per capita drops continuously thus you never get to make tax rate believable  also when you go to save the game will crash which means you have to play non stop  still issues with military but now when attacking a country your allies will move into first zone you attack and sit there which will not allow you to annex contry  these issues have been going on for some time and many players have notified the company of them but they still have not been fixed instead company just keeps putting out corrupted patches game is still long way off from full playable release

#####

unequivocally one of the absolute worst games i have ever played the bugs are numerous and insurmountable the ai is bad and clearly is only scripted to react rather than to actually play the game like the ai in a normal game it has online only drm and it runs abhorrently on any graphics settings on modern hardware rather than rant the reasons this is atrocious i will simply say that the many many negative reviews are all merited this game is unfinished and thq is an absolute disgrace for allowing this game to be released in this state i would compare the current state of the game to a pre alpha build rather than something worth your time and money i wanted a refund even sooner but i had to play this waste of time for this long to even get the ability to leave a review spend your money in anything but this

#####

unreponsive ai
i can peace annex an region and that country wouldnt do anything about it not even a complete game to start with
no world news around the globe unlike sp2
its just seems like a unfinished game that they tried to release at fast

at this point i would rather play sp2
soooooo dissapointing

#####

what a pity

#####

waste of time not only for the consumer but clearly the dev team as well

#####

buggy pretty barebones shouldnt of been released like this

#####

please can somebody make a decent political game i was so excited for this as power and revolution is simply unplayable due to the bugs so i bought and downloaded this and i spent some time watching the clock tick by after moving some sliders around and i thought is this it this cant be it  it was it
the only positive remark i have is that the game has to be given credit as it takes well under the 2 hour refund policy to know this game is a missed opportunity

#####

there is not really any gameplay in the game buy victoria 3 instead

#####

impressively bad

#####

it keeps crashing also doesnt worse the money a lot of propaganda on the game while it looks like a shit

#####

not finished game runs on one unchangeable speed slow not optimized at all sliders are 90 of the game and those are a pain to work with ai countries dont do anything grammatical errors everywhere got my refund i feel bad for the people waited nearly 20 years for this

#####

i only bought this game because i loved superpower 2 but this game is sooooo bad do not even try to waste your money this game is not worth any penny there is nothing good in the game soooo complicated and unplayeable freezing and lagging and sliders not working  even with best gamer pc

#####

what a mess very few options broken sliders nothing seems to make any impact whatever country i choose no matter what i do with the economy it doesnt make a difference i start losing money even if every sector usa shows greenpositive just to see what would happen as the us i nuked russia with 78 icbms the most it would let me select russia retaliated with like 6 icbms then i nuked china it let me select 33 icbms china retaliated with 20 or so other countries started attacking my resources around the world i could see icons where battles were happening but i had no idea the details i understand the superpower series is more about diplomacy and economics but jeez i should at least be able to see battle details

in summary superpower is a game that plays itself and only gives you a small glimpse of what its doing

im not going to ask for a refund i supported superpower 1 i believe in golem labs but they have a lot of work ahead to make this one worthwhile

#####

its disappointing in every sense of the word to use an analogy  if games were like meals served to you in a restaurant this game is just the plate on which the meal should have been
also regarding the price it doesnt really seem fair to charge 30 for what is essentially a google earth with some barely functioning sliders slapped on top
i hope this game gets some much need love because despite its current state i think it has potential and i will gladly change my review if it does improve but right now i cant in good conscience recommend it

18042023
well it seems that the game has been abandoned for good while there have been some bug fixes the game isnt anywhere near a fixed state and it is lightyears from an enjoyable state
quite frankly this game is easily one of the worst disappointments i have ever experienced in all my years of being a fan of strategy games it didnt even begin to improve before it got abandoned like for example imperator rome did i deeply regret my decision not to refund this game when i had the chance

#####

boy oh boy this game is a dumpster fire and i even gave it a fair shake i have been playing sp since the beginning and man am i sad by the lunch of this game it is incredibly laggy very shallow i mean its so bad i dont even know where to begin to be honest they either need to get to work fixing this mess or start refunding money

#####

please dont buy this   its a poor excuse for a game in the best of circumstances but putting it forward as a contender for a geopolitical simulation game is laughable   there are plenty of other reviews here that point out countless issues with ui ai graphics navigation etc trust them they are true 

dont buy this game

#####

stunning and brave

#####

ui seems laggy missing the ai helperi used it for financial could be better not worth the hype as of now

#####

wow this is will bad i love superpower but this is bad  i cant believe we waited so long for this this is crazy

#####

i wanted to say this game doesnt seem to be finished  but that would be too nice
its not even a game its a completely useless world map simulator stuck in alpha theres no tutorial theres no interaction with other countries 
i played with france attacked andorra and the whole world was just like well okay you do your thing france at least i think thats what they said because i didnt get any reaction at all 
the menus are just decoration nothing you change seems to have any consequence
i really hoped this would be something like a wellmade power and revolution but its sooo much worse than pr 
save your money and dont buy it

#####

game should have never been released in this state disappointing sequel to a great title

#####

first time playing this type of game and i have 95 approval on hard and i am making tons of money without using any guides there is a severe lack of difficulty and things to do other than start wars you can easily improve relations with other countries and get into an alliance with almost everyone and so far i have not seen any conflict in the game without starting it myself
when territorialio is a more realistic representation of the world than your managementwargame then you must have seriously dropped the ball

didnt know this series existed until 3 days ago and i was still disappointed

#####

i dont know what i just played didnt seem like a game nothing happened on the world map no tutorial no nothing changed budget sliders nothing happened won an election via a onetime text box notification legalized drugs and invested in production only to find out that nothing happens apparently my country did not have any geographical resources for it i didnt really care at that point sorry for the devs who had to push this out

#####

this is by far the most horrible attempt at a successor for a gameabsolute trash graphics user interface ai and i can keep going this has to be the worst release of the year

#####

disappointing im just going to try for a refund and then buy it in about a year or so

#####

basically you have postal 2 amazing game and beloved then postal 3 came out and the game was just terrible and ruined the franchise this is how i can explain superpower 3 superpower 2 is a beloved game then 3 came what is it with games that have number 3 being either the worst or the best

#####

this is the worst game to have ever been created

i could go on all day about how glitchy unscripted and rubbish everything is

in this game nuclear explosions are ridiculously unrealistic and nukes dont do any damage to nations

i hope before playing this game you look at some videos

#####

first of the ui is terrible i dont know whats what also why cant i speed up time its just a pause and play button thats itahonestly thought the reviews were just that a toxic train where people had false expectations of the game i requested a refund literally a day later after this came out i wanted to give this game a chance combat looks a bit tedious   they need to add and fix a few things before i can ever consider to repurchase this game i wanted to like it i really did try

#####

i was really looking forward to this game but its bug ridden and would crash before i could get to the main home page i have already received my refund

#####

honestly feels like an insult to everyone who waited almost 15 years for this controls are janky sliders are unresponsive scroll is broken and thematic maps give the same color for almost everybody military and combat are a joke there is no designer some models are for a completely different type of unit and there is a laughably small number of units the character designer seems almost entirely unnecessary to me the hardest part was getting it to remember my name which it didnt anyway

#####

bad made me download superpowers 2 instead and for 30 dollars damn

update nov 1 omg its worse now needs a lot of stability fixes and i mean a lot

#####

edit looks like the game is being updated but there doesnt even seem to be an apology just the game is released and then patch notes articles the fact that there was a bunch of talk before release hyping up the game and then once it releases in a broken state not even an apology awful

build #27642

this is a release that absolutely needs an immediate pr note from either developer or publisher  this is an absolute joke that the game has released in this state someone on that team needs to explain how and why the game is in the state that its in

here i was thinking this was supposed to be a great competitor to the power and revolution series turns out its even worse than that how did absolutely no one even remotely double check the game version that was supposed to release if this is the version that was supposed to release then thats just a massive disappointment and shouldnt be on steam or even near 30 usd at all

 got stuck on the splash screen when starting the game
 main menu didnt even load properly the first time
 no fancy cutscenes as shown off in the gifs on the steam page  which is really misleading
 creating a character feels pointless when you dont see them in any cutscenes  if those even exist
 no tutorial seriously
 ai countries dont do anything until you do something eg nuke them and they nuke back instantly
 combat is confusing to figure out see also no tutorial
 cant target specific cities if you want to attack them nukes just go across the whole country
 theres no message system compared to pr just full screen messages and nothing else
 i did the absolute opposite of the usa starting states made everything illegal locked down the internet etc and yet my approval was somehow 55  after nuking russia it was 84 its like anything you do to your own country just doesnt matter at all no riots because of your decisions no tensions nothing
 cant even zoom into the city areas so if theres another button instead of just zooming in all the way then whats the point

game overall feels very lackluster and leaves a lot to be desired very embarrassing that the effort of power and revolution couldnt even be matched and that game series has been copypaste for the past few years

#####

i didnt have high expectations but i didnt think it could be this bad  this game is awful it is nowhere near the quality of sp2 and i have requested a refund

the game is clunky has so many user faces which add nothing and you cant change anything in them the military interface is shocking and very unclear as far as i can see it doesnt even include basics such as memberships of differing organisations such as the eu

feels like a university students graphic design project  looks good but no functionality 

probably best for some more unofficial updates to sp2

#####

no option to change time more simplistic combat than previous versions just not worth my time or yours in its current state

#####

unfinished

#####

so disappointing lacks politics restricted military control basically a wait and see how your budget does which isnt much fun sp1 was wayyyyy better sp2 was better hopefully a mod community is able to help we waited way to long for this to be this bad

#####

ive been waiting for a sequel to superpower 2 for years and then we get thisthing i wanted this to be at least better than sp2 but its nothing more than at best a copypaste with new graphics and somehow buggier ui and ai it was very obviously rushed simply to make a deadline extremely disappointed

#####

soulless buggy mess of a game game is supposed to be a geopolitical simulator but is wildly inaccurate dont waste your money

#####

this game worth only less than 2 bucks not more looks like single developer made it in a few month

#####

huge disappointment not sure how as a organisation they got this so wrong especially charging thier loyal fan base knowing there is currently a global financial crisis they need to refund everyone at least 50 reclassify it as early access and use the other 50 of revenue to work with this community to guide its development the person who authorised the release of this game within the business is a crook

#####

total waste of time took them 18 years to churn out whats essentially a map simulator played half an hour if you can call it playing and got a refund do not buy unless they massively overhaul

i loved superpower 2 and was so hyped for this but its just so bad

#####

needs a major workout to fix big problems within the gameplay

#####

disappointment

#####

youre better off saving your money and buying superpower 2 installing the mods and playing online with the discord community to be fair i was playing with a dualcore and not a quadcore processor my mistake beyond that i played 5 times and it crashed all 5 times i couldnt find any multiplayer games to join 
the combat was worse than superpower 2 i somehow defeated 10s of 1000s of opposing units with under 200 units though superpower 2s combat screened left something to be desired at least it had one 
the inclusion of an avatar that may have an impact on your populations approval of you adding ethnic groups are the only interesting additions i saw in my 25 hours of playing this game unfortunately this addition did not outweigh the parts taken out of the political sphere you could do in superpower 2 and not in 3
i barely touched the economic sphere found nothing to note

go for sp2  mods  discord

#####

honestly its bare bones half of it isnt working correctly and multiplayer is completely broken even for a smaller developer i expected a better release i wont refund because i have hopes that it can be fixed but in the state its in i do not recommend

#####

didnt work on steam deck crashes at loading screen buggy mess

#####

do not buy really disappointing i was looking forward to superpower 3 foolishly bought it without looking too indepth i assumed it would follow the normal patch until it functions correctly that a fair few companies do but to abandon it essentially outright basically a scam

#####

what is the point of positive balance if youre going to hemorrhage money in a ghostly fashion makes zero sense

income per year as peru   3 billion
yet losing money the entire calendar year totally makes sense


while the game seems to be on the verge of fun it just feels everything went wrong from a behindthescenes logic

also how the eff is america not selling weapon systems thats the most nonamerican thing ive ever seen in a game

010 would not see weapon systems for purchase from the worlds largest arms dealer

edit spelling is hard

#####

edit to hell with waiting  for two weeks they dont deserve it refund requested

bought the game immediately upon release notification 

well nothing is working in this game i just set a refund reminder before two weeks would pass that is how unplayable unfinished and disappointing a mess this is dear devs either let us know exactly what improvements patches corrections etc you are planning to release within the next two weeks to make the game playable otherwise i and i do not believe only i will ask for a refund and wont ever bother even looking up where the game is headed in the future

having waited for this game for quite a while i feel worse than disappointed

#####

no

sp2 had more content and that was very limited simulation

1  you dont get to change the sim speed
2  you dont get to make many economic choices
3  you barely get to change any laws
4  you do not get to pick a political party in your chosen nation
5  the world map is buggy sometimes it doesnt zoom all the way at all
6  playing small nations is unplayable unless you like sitting around for days waiting on the one speed setting some small 
     nations are impossible to do anything
7  the ui is just so unnecessarily big takes up 14th of the screen looks like a mobile game
8  if you have wide screen prepare to play in only a window because you cannot change the resolution in full screen
9  combat is a mess if you have a lot of units it can be nearly impossible to tell them apart
10 map themes to see demographics resources or nations doesnt work as soon as you click away it reverts back to 
      player borders only maybe i want to see all the nations in different colors the whole game so the earth doesnt look  
      like a black and white ball all the time

i would not recommend this game till they fix these issues maybe they can contact the people who made terra invicta on how to optimize a simulation that game runs smoother and has the entire solar system

#####

edit edit the devs havent updated the game since january and the discord has gone cold the game is dead do not buy

i have been really excited about this game since it was announced but i did my best to keep my expectations in check turns out nothing could have prepared me for this release the game is basically super power 2 reskinned which i actually do not think is a bad thing in the slightest being able to get the super power 2 gameplay on a modern engine is great however the game is so immensely bugged that the game is unenjoyable

 after concurring all the regions of a nation they still exist and you are put in a permanent war with them in the diplomacy tab
 every new year starts at 1020xx
 troops randomly appear and disappear
 seems fixed  troops sometime dont move
 fixed  many logos and icons are missing and are replaced with just a checker board
 you can only take one territory per treaty meaning you have to make many separate treaties to conquer a nation
 even at low settings the game seems to lag might be a hardware problem on my part
 fixed  the lack of speed controls is really annoying
 fixed  the most units you can build at a time is only 10000 which is basically nothing
 you cant tell your troops to occupy a countrys territory like in sp2
 trades in pending trades menu are missing text
 thematic map reverts back to standard after clicking another nation
 seems fixed  previous troop movement lines remain after troops finish moving
 kinda fixed  now they show your flag instead capital flags of conquered nations persist after their downfall
 multiplayer is extremely laggy
 investing the in economy causes gdp to decrease might be intentional to show the lowering of profits not sure

things i like
 the new battle zone tactical maps
 the new ui
 the character creator

i will update this review if any of these problems get fixed which i truly hope that they will or if i find more i just wish the game would have been developed more or at least released in early access big disappointment

edit the devs have been keeping us in the loop and have been releasing patches every week i highly recommend joining the discord to keep an eye on whats going on i will be changing my review to positive after i believe the game is mostly playable

#####

as everyone else said unfinished and unplayable should have awaited the first reviews before buying

#####

thank god for steam refund policy this game is complete hot garbage it felt like a mobile game all clunky and buggy the ui is disgusting and a eye sore economy tab is a horrible downgrade from the 2004 version even war got a downgrade random squares on a map to represent the battle field and no more 3d battles nukes seem like just a visual and a broken component this has ruined my night and my columbus day weekend i hope the devs realize how much of a joke this game is

#####

growing up super power ii is one of the top tier games i played and really shaped me into loving massive complex games sadly this game was not even even close its not even a game its awful in ever way i am hoping that this is a prank and the real game is coming out soon

#####

the game is unfinished and thats really disappointing i have waited for over 12 years and the game looks worse and way buggier than sp2 when it only released

010

hope to see this game rise from this situation into the greatness that was sp2 when i was a child

#####

this game was said to have support for steamdeck but i have spent the last 3 days attempting to play and have gone no further than the loading screen i have tried different compatibility settings and switched to desktop mode with no success sp2 is my most favorite game of all time so it is very sad seeing sp3 at this level it is very disappointing that the developers released an unfinished product thinking it would do well

#####

awful game iam writing this in english so more people get the message not to buy it
i hope i get my money back even though i played it for too long well playing is a strong word

i basically sat there waiting a  long time for my units to be built so i could invade countries and finally do sth since economy was in private hands meaning it was on automatic but since u cant speed up i waited eons for my strong troops i closed the game and looked into the commentrs just to find out that i did experience the maximum of gameplay hooray me

maybe if they would add events when sth changes in the system or you can do sth boost immigration  without jjust pulling dials

#####

i dont get why they even bothered with this

same features as sp2 actually less worse ui worse ai more bugs

see you in 12 years if you didnt abandon this project by then

#####

completely garbage just refund it

#####

bad

unfinished  buggy   missing many features from sp2  terrible interface  avoid

#####

broken sliders need to right click on countries multiple times for the menu to pop up military sections buttons dont even work the game was abandoned in jan 2023 absolute disgrace go play superpower 2 its better

#####

started off bad its getting better

#####

it is still in early access no tutorial although i spent a lot of hours in sp2 i couldnt manage to figure out a lot of aspect of the game this still isnt complete most systems are not functional or are unclear i really like the series and i havent refunded but i wouldnt advise anyone to buy it at this current state

edit after trying the game for one time it failed to lunch again and with 2 updates i still cant launch it i manage to see intro then an empty background with music and support eventually couldnt solve the issue with all logs sent i also removed and reinstalled all game files several times but cant see if the updates are any good or no

#####

against my better judgement i bought this on launch day  i tried to play it for about an hour and found it glitchy and unresponsive on a fairly high end gaming laptop  its pretty bad if this was released in an unfinished state but its truly unforgivable if this is considered the final product  learned my lesson and had the product refunded

if you have superpower 2 youll have a much more enjoyable experience  it is a complete product with seemingly more features than this sequel  another disappointing example that newer is rarely better

#####

worse game to ever come to steam absolute crap

#####

absolute dogshit

#####

less finished than the previous game doesnt even feel like early access

i tried to get a refund but i guess i left the menu open for a while so i had more than 2 hours recorded which is a scam they arent supposed to count time in menus 

waste of money dont buy this game

#####

superpower 2 i sunk probably 34 years of my life into this is very bad superbug 3

#####

waited a decade for this literal disappointment

#####

lazy worthless and insulting this game honestly isnt worth your time and not even updates or dlc will save it save you money and buy sp2

#####

0 content the game is empty like it just look empty nothings to do you could launch the game go for hours and wait it will work just fine pure scamers putting good graphic to attract

#####

no

#####

long story short this game is entirely horrifically ludicrous if you have ever dreamt to make jamaica or gabon super power in 45 years this game unprecedentedly convenient for you
i firmly believe that they had started to develop this game as a mobile game then they turned into develop pc game otherwise there is no explanation of this game as a fan of sp2 this game just debases sp2s legacy 

besides of the numereous amount of bugs and crashes the gameplay solely rubbish after spent an hour in this game i thought i just scammed then i am enlightened and starting to enjoy the awfulness of this game and i wanted to enlist them
list
 they added angel investor to the game disguised as a usa you can easily demand billions of dollars from the usa as a fiscal aid
 most of the countries undoubtedly share with you their military technologies
 you can ban every political parties and even elections without any consequences in my experience they boosted my approval though
 regardless of which country that you control you can increase the taxes 100 and give incenvtives billions of dollars to every sector this will be skyrocketed your economy and you already know that where you are going to find enough cash at the early stages 
 you can nuke and obliterate every country that have bothered you most of the cases nobody cares 
 you can perform stress test to your computer whilst playing this game which is a brilliant idea
 most importantly this game is very didactic if you do not know the earths shape or existence of the moon the game literally engrave this information into your brain 

list

#####

server is always busy so the game lags and freezes it sux dont buy until they get the server issue figured out youll just be frustrated

#####

okthis game is way too hard to play its honestly ridiculous at this point the ui looks nice but it is very impractical now i understand that i am relatively new to the game but this is just insane i spent quite some time just trying to figure out basic functions such as how to select units and move them and just overall do basic things that shouldnt be the case this game is just too difficult to manage in the sense that they make it impossible to do things 

#####

after a look at the golemlabs website this company hardly exists maybe they are scamming thq maybe thq pushed too hard idk game sucks tho nothing works there is much less detail in the numbers and you can kinda do whatever you want without consequences i hope this game gets updates and the devs fix this yea well i hope the devs even exist and this isnt another steamscam
edit linkedin says the phone number is 8195566201 for golem labs btw

#####

textures and icons commonly fail to load some ingame menus and sliders randomly laggy ai utterly useless cant queue military production or build more than one thing at a time no clear indication of build time and new units seem to deploy only to your capital 

played as uk declared war on invaded and annexed ireland within 30 minutes no consequences whatsoever

seems to be missing pretty much everything people enjoyed in superpower 2 but hey at least now you get to create an apparently pointless avatar

hot garbage avoid

#####

completely broken more confusing and less functional than sp2 very little content and actual control over your country no way to speed up time and war system flat out does not work

#####

they made the game worse by adding inflation

#####

was a huge fan of super power 2 back in the day and only dreamt of a follow up to it now that its come i wish it never did ive never refunded a game before the grotesque thought of being a karen demanding a refund for my poor choices was always enough to shy me away from that needless to say i refunded this game

#####

junk

#####

wow that was terrible and embarrassing to play 

as soon as i loaded in i had a big warning pop up on my screen when you actually get into the game you realize theres literally nothing to do and i mean nothing except look at some sliders wanna make weed illegal or legal just flick the slider no parliament necessary organising my army is another absolute mess diplomacy is clunky and the game hardly tells you about random values and stats or theyll tell you what it is but not tell you the scale that it is measured on i mean you guys could have waited to release this until it was polished and literally nobody would have noticed or cared but you guys knew what you were doing waste of money will be refunding as i dont even see myself playing this game for another minute 

ladies and gentlemen the most boring geopolitical game to date

#####

if they had kept updating it like they said they were going toit would have been ok i will never buy thq again

#####

its not even a demo

#####

wow just wow is all i can say i have waited for this day forever this game is soooooo bad i cannot believe it was released the way it was the game is totally broken who ever thought this game was ready for release needs to be fired i will be getting a refund i was so hoping for at least a game this is just garbage i wouldnt even take this game if someone paid me 30 bucks to play it

#####

much worse than 2

#####

please fix the game quickly at least copy what was in your sp2 and paste it on your sp3
many of the advantages have disappeared i like the sp2 game more as it is more comprehensive and diverse
where is the economic and global news tape the environment disasters and wars

#####

props for sticking with it and continuing to work at it stay focused devs

#####

very broken right now couldnt play multiplayer with my friend which was half the reason of buying the game 

should of launched as early access or been delayed until it was in a good state

#####

idk why all the negative feedback they did a decent job giving us a sequel i can only hope they will update the game regularly and well

#####

stopped playing after 26 minutes extreme disappointment

#####

not that bad could be better definitely needs more features feels a little easy i played with iran and in less than 2 hours of game play i was able to get outta debt and put my country in a great financial position just felt like it was missing something more on the plus side they are constantly updating i havent seen many bugs and my game hasnt crashed once i would wait if you dont want to spend the 30 maybe they will be good sports and offer a discount since they screwed up so bad


scratch that this game is crap

#####

bad

#####

this game really needs some work i look forward to seeing the updates and patches superpower 2 will just have to do for now 


562023
1625 hrs

i hope some more updates are released

#####

i wanted this to be so good i loved the previous game but this was just a giant wall of cultural bs that added nothing ot the game it was like it was just a text based game looking at walls of data no tutorial that i could find did not help at all feels like a slap in the face to all of us that wanted a sequel to sp2 i feel like the super power 2 had way more to offer then the current refunded maybe in a few months if they bother doing anything with it ill give it another try but as is not fun or playable at all literally whole world was populated with jane and john doe leaders really

#####

im not a regular strategy game player but i see some flaws regarding that i think i just some hint to help me understand all the possibilities and features the game has to offer so i feel a bit lost not very newbiefriendly  like i dont understand what i have to do to nuke a country or to enhance my cannabis production xd 
never the less i see the potential of the game and the good will of the team to fix that and help me create my thug state  so please continue the updates 

#####

badddddddddddddddddddddddddddd

#####

game still has some major issues like trade being completely broken but i feel they are on their way to make a halfdecent game

#####

biggest dissappointment i ever had i love political games and i thought this was gping to be my new addictionobssesion like gps4

#####

the game need to be more work on the game is very fun  

#####

awful just bad not fun not even a program or a game a joke on anyone who buys this game  worse game i ever purchased on steam in 20 years

#####

i really love the franchise and and this game especially and would recomend

bugs   war makes it totally slow when i quit the game it gets stuck open in steam

i changed my mind after good ol sleep  it 100 has bugs and feels lacking in certain areas but the gui i dont think is that bad  i think its better than superpower 2 gui 

war needs more work  units move way too slow and with no option to change the speed of the game it gets tiresome  just slow medium and fast mode would be nice  i know i can change the speed in the ini files but i dont want to constantly go fast

should have released the sandbox mode with more config options  i ended up copying it and editing the code to give myself 100t p that should have been possible from the game setup menu 

its not a sandbox if its not got cheats imo




#####

good start  looking forward to the update 

#####

horrible not at all similar to the previous superpowers incorrect country borders crimea is not recognized as part of russia in this game incorrect party names for most countries over complicated ui will be filing for a refund

#####

i really like the game so far a lot of dept in the control you can create your own world story so many possibility 

the multiplayer is also very fun you can make even more creative story also the recent patch made a big difference now the game is much more fluid 


#####

yeah guys its pretty bad but im sure golem is going to come out with the patches

#####

битвы зависают намертво игра лагает
