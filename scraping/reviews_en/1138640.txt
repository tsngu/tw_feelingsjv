i would not recommend this game in this current state if you are on the fence about getting it wait a little bit

now i know the game is in early access and i accepted the fact there would be bugs and issues when i paid for it however i would not call this early access i would call this alpha there are very very big problems that shouldnt be happening when a game is released to purchased but i am of good faith and do believe it may have been unforeseen things

buprosub

 the career mode is perfect for people who like to have guidelines dont feel like creating from scratch etc it can get a little repetitive but it is to be expected with such a game
 you have 100 free reign on what you do you are not bound to a short list curated to a specific client and can pick and chose what you want you can buy land to build from scratch too
each rank up brings a lot of new items colors swatches etc etc
 the game is very chill when it works

buconsub strap in losers were going for a ride
 there was a sandbox mode announced but it was not in the early access is it perhaps because it was causing issues still kind of disappointing for those who like freeplay
 the client system is broken as heck you can follow every single minute detail they asked for and still get docked points and receive a rather nasty review it seems like everything is completely random and ive had to do a lot of trial and error to pinpoint what each exact word means in terms of likesdislikes and what to put in a room still getting random fails but i was able to go up to rank 12 with an excellent reputation ipenny pincher means you gotta put bad quality stuff in the room btwi

 speaking of reputation each job plays on your reputation one nasty review and your rep tanks like my gas on the highway but boy oh boy does it take an arm a leg and an offering to six different gods just to get a little bit of rep back up
 there is no way to filter items other than their main category so if i wanted to look for only modern stuff i cant i have to open each section of the shop to look for the modern things you also cannot filter to only see a certain type of quality which is in itself slightly annoying
 some collections are incomplete especially in the kitchen you have to patchwork a frankenstein worthy monster to get all the required items for a kitchen and say goodbye to things looking good its gonna look like my kindergarten painting projects
 the recolor option is very clunky trying to change the finish of a piece of furniture means even the knobs are getting changed some items can only be recolored on one side but not the other it seems like some hitboxes may not have been added
 speaking of that there is a cleaning mechanic in this game that really really needs work first of all r for action is not the best option but also some pieces of trash or dirt are inside a wall and cannot be removed thus docking you points when turning in the job
 objects can go through walls to a certain point and stick out the other side so sometimes you have to spend time fixing a room that is locked before you can start on your actual job
 some rooms are deemed too small for the type they are but you cannot make them bigger the builddemolish options are greyed out and you are stuck with an incomplete room thus forcing you to abandon the job and take a rep hit ilooking at you 6 tiles small living room that could barely fit a couch in but still required 17 itemsi

 some rooms are even non existent or simply cannot be played because they are overlappinginside other rooms again forcing you to abandon the job and take a rep hit
 the performance of the game is abysmal even on the lowest setting my computer struggles to play the game without lag it makes things extremely choppy and difficult
 the hitboxes for walls floors ceilings and roofs are very badly placed they are at the top of the item which makes it difficult to align walls properly when trying to build a room takes a little bit of finnicking to understand how to do it properly
 you can drag across a room to assign a room but you cant drag to put down floors you have to single click every time same thing for the walls
 the snap to grid is extremely buggy and does not let you put things where you technically can when free handed
 it is impossible to rebind your keys to have a more intuitive placement
 the axis are inverted by default and turning it off breaks the axis entirely
 unity crashed on me 4 times in 2 days
 you cannot create a second profile or save game you are stuck with the current one you have uninstalling the game will not delete your save unless you deactivate the steam cloud
 the music is not it 5 minutes in i muted the game and listened to my own it gets very choppy but also super repetitive real quick

i have put almost 20h into this game because despite my negative review i do enjoy this type of game and the concept of it is very down my alley the devs seem quite active in the community and do seem to take players opinions at heart so i am hopeful it will get better i remember other games being rough when they came out so i iami eager to see what future patches and updates will bring

and despite my extreme frustration i will keep playing this game because i see the potential

but if i were you id wait before buying it

#####

the first thing i tried to do was build a new kitchen but the cabinets dont line up you cant make an unbroken line of cabinets either they overlap and clip or theyre individual units  also when you try to place them using the grid snapping tool they dont align to the grid properly and dont snap to each other

ive requested a refund ill have another look in a few months and see if theyve sorted out these basics

#####

been with them since they started was a beta tester alpha tester and they still havent fixed a single bug i pointed out my lord i even asked them in discord and they ignored me just another company in it for the money and zero care in the game go back to your mobile games if you just want money  sad

#####

after some decent playtime during the games playtest phase its clear that this title holds significant potential the core mechanics and gameplay are engaging however the game suffers from severe performance issues on higherend hardware which greatly diminish its enjoyability

hardware specifications
graphics card nvidia rtx 4070ti
processor intel core i713700f
ram 32gb
storage installed on nvme ssd

despite running the game on a higher end system that exceeds the recommended specifications i encountered jarring frame rate drops and struggled to maintain a stable 40 fps even on lower settings these performance issues make the game difficult to enjoy and inhibit its gameplay experience

recommendation
as it currently stands i cannot recommend purchasing this game due to the aforementioned performance issues however you might consider picking it up while its on its launch sale if you are willing to tolerate lessthanoptimal performance while awaiting updates it might be worth considering

i believe the game has the potential to offer a compelling experience but i will personally be shelving it until the developers address its performance shortcomings

#####

hometopia was a godsend for people who grew up with games like the sims and then moved on to games like house flipper hometopia is designed as a game that lets you design your own houses using over a thousand items to be placed as well as several different floor and wall designs along with designing your own house there is a career mode that allows you to earn money so you can add on to your newly constructed or designed house

pros
1 tons and i mean tons of ways to design and construct your house from roof design to bathroom design to an outdoor bar and playhouse
2 amazing developers that are active and looking for new ways to design the game to best suit the needs of their players
3 welldesigned career mode with no bugs that i can detect currently  i know others have had some but none on my end
4 the ability to manipulate items in any way you want really
5 the ability to place an item down and to fully customize that item with fabric color and textures wood textures etc

cons
1 sound is a bit off some people may not like the music and then if you turn the music off it becomes a quiet wasteland

overall despite the game being an early access it is already working its way up to one of the best games i have played in a long time if you were a fan of the sims or house flipper you will find enjoyment in this game

edit i know people were saying it has performance issues i play on a computer with pretty awful integrated graphics and i have yet to experience any major issues regarding performance other than a crash or two i have pretty good 40 fps on medium settings

they have also come out and talked about future updates 
1 communities  designing your own shops etc
2 sandbox mode yes its coming so people listing it as a negative should have noted that it is coming soon

edit you should absolutely join their discord and interact with the amazing community they have formed lots of sociality in here

edit #3 sandbox mode is back in the game if you were missing out on the game due to the lack of sandbox you should come on back cause we now have a full on sandbox mode to create homes to your hearts desires they also patched a ton of bugs and added optimization fixes with more on the way

#####

i bought this game so i could design homes from scratch without limitations which i remember was mentioned in the description im not finding any way to do so without having to take on jobs i was not looking to have to grind it at all i wanted to use it as a creativity tool would it be possible to have a sandbox mode

#####

it breaks my heart to do this but i cant recommend this game at this time cozy games of all types are my favorite genre and ive played a lot there is so much good here as a cozy building game a la house flipper but the game play lag and reputation system have impacted my play enough to give it a negative rating 

pros

decent graphics    the textures are really nice and i enjoy that its more realistic and not cartoony like sims 4 

buildbuy     you unlock a ton of stuff as you rank up so you definitely feel rewarded each time more options always makes design games more fun and they deliver 

varied job types    as you rank up you unlock more complicated jobs like multiroom builds or renovations and landscaping the jobs change based on the neighborhoods you have unlocked as well 

ranking system   theres an overall player rank and then ranks for each type of specialization ie interior design building landscaping etc there are rewards for each but the specialization ranks dont have rewards yet i do love this system and im looking forward to seeing what is implemented

cons 

reputation this is by far the biggest reason im giving the game a negative rating and its because it has such a huge consequence on gameplay in theory i like the idea  you get bonus pay on jobs the customers like depending on your overall player reputation you get less money on completed jobs if your reputation is poor however the system moves so slow on trying to move the reputation that you can be completing awesome jobs and still need like 6 completions to make average money this type of system is beyond frustrating in a cozy game 

     additionally when youre completing jobs you can literally follow all their likesdislikes preferences on furniture and minmax styles and still get 1 star and a nasty review ever since my first 2 jobs outside of the tutorial ive really paid attention to this system and im honestly not sure how anyone has a decent reputation im rank 6 and poor rep and ive done over 20 individual jobs testing this system its now so frustrating that im putting the game down

lag  im experiencing a decent amount of graphics lag my machine is a bit older but i assumed that since i can run the sims 4 with every dlc and mods that id be okay here that is not the case ive accidentally painted wood floors because of the bleeding thats occurring thats more of a me thing than the game but i did want to bring this up for any other cozy players like me that might have older pcs i think a good solution to this for the devs would be to bring this to geforce now 

i hope to be updating this review with good news as development progresses glhf

#####

this shouldnt be making high end pcs run hot

#####

hometopia has changed so the old negative reviews shouldnt affect game play anymore and with a few bug fixes is now the perfect game to play especially with the sandbox mode try it out if your interested

#####

dont waste your money right now its filled with bugs and freezescrashes constantly i bought this as a comfy chill game but instead it makes me rage  and stressed i requested a refund

edit buyer beware refund request was denied due to too much playtime but most of that was the game being stuck on my computer and just having to walk away dont make the mistake i did dont buy this game just to pay to have a stuck game

#####

house flipper with coop
rough around the edges but has a lot of potential

#####

there are many things that need to be worked on the fact that sometimes the game doesnt recognize an item youve put down no matter what you do kills it for me its happened multiple times and ive always just restarted the home which you cant do on multiplayer and that fixes the problem most of the time however thats not a reliable solution especially when you spend hours making a home only for it not to recognize a pathway youve put down and now you cant finish the home or start any new projects all because the game is refusing to recognizer something youve put onto a lot or into a room

i also dislike how existing rooms are locked sometimes shifting a room in a house to make a hallway to a room youve built looks better than putting a million doors in a bedroom to get to another bedroom youve had to build for the client or creating a hallway that goes the length of the house just to get to a room theyve had you build

id also like an explanation of traits etc what makes something minimalist vs organized it also sucks when they want a specific trait like modern and then they have you do a kids room cause it always comes out as kids and they dock off money because of that i would also like to be able to search for items based on the trend the client likes modern traditional vintage etc

demolishing floors or ceilings near walls is really annoying because you have to be specific when clicking bottom corner or else youll demolish something you didnt intend to if i could just click the middle that would be superb

i know i have a lot of dislikes but i do enjoy playing the game please keep updating the game and making it better i look forward to what else you do

#####

well right now its really only playable on the lowest graphics setting i tried it higher and it was extremely sluggish also there is no audio apart from music which i dont want still i love these kinds of games so heres to lots of improvements along the way

#####

this game isnt fun mostly because i cant for the life of me figure out what makes for a good result maybe im missing something but i havent been able to understand what the difference is between good and bad quality rooms and what makes people hate items when i only have the tiniest bit of available information

the ui is very ugly and annoying to use the look of the menus reminds me of the sims the first one that came out 23 years ago its not that difficult to do better than that it makes me think the designers were so busy with the ingame items and didnt spare any time to look at the actual ui finding items is difficult and unintuitive

the performance is also awful ive been playing a lot of baldurs gate 3 lately and its notable that my computer has to work harder to run hometopia than bg3

#####

now that sandbox mode is available i recommend this game to anyone who likes building andor decorating homes

#####

very very buggy in its current state definitely not worth 20 yet items and paintwallpaper on walls can disappear when you reload saves as well as the undo button refusing to undo the most recent thing youve done sometimes and undoing something completely different

the lighting and shadows are kinda weird in some situations and seem to prefer higher settings in order to work properly the amount of items and furniture to choose from is super duper lacking which could be seen as a side effect of the whole early access thing but ive seen many game companies hide behind that excuse before

theyve had plenty of time to fix some of these major bugs since release but according to some of the other reviews reported bugs have not been fixed since its beta and alpha test phase not a good sign at all

#####

very rough around the edges at the moment and is missing features that games like home flipper has eg uploading a photo to put in your own house i would have also liked to be given an empty plot to build a house rather than given a prefab as my house that takes a lot of money to be remodeled finally the performance is very taxing on my midrange computer so there just isnt a lot of optimization done it seems will maybe take a second look at this game when it is further through development but i was excited for this game and it was a bit disappointing for sure

#####

pros

 great potential with its core concept reminiscent of the sims
 offers a unique take on house building and design

areas for improvement

 optimization needs significant attention for smoother gameplay
 encountered issues with tools notably the snapping feature for countertops
 a sandbox mode would be a valuable addition for unrestricted creativity

#####

this game is one big bug xd game devs did u just started to remove items which already was game bcs it looks like it xdd i cant find any cars or eg those red high heels xd

#####

i do enjoy this game dont get me wrong it is exactly as i expected and is really fun until you start taking jobs giving the customers everything they want and even getting bonus money for said achievements but they rank you a one star and eventually you drop to the lowest rank possible and start getting less money for jobs because of that rating how do i get my rating to go up if im already doing the best i can to make the customers happy 

so for this reason alone is why i thumbs downed the game i do love it i do but the ranking system is making me annoyed with the game and making me not want to play

#####

ive played for a grand total of 2 hours since my purchase the bugs are still plenty and its not very fun i kinda just want my money back 

not worth what i paid

#####

essentially played 12hrs straight today on release  i have played sims games since i was in elementary school and have recently been on a house flipper binge decorating is my fav feature in any rpg or sim game  i have been watching this game nonstop since they paid all my favorite youtubers and i had super high hopes as an early access game for the price id give it a 6510 

pros 
 lots of customization on swatches and details on the items
 pretty extensive catalog for early access 
 plenty to do enough of variety to keep things feeling fresh for a while 
 good reasons to progress and grind to explore the other areas of the map 
 so much room for creativity on your own lots 
 easy to make money quickly and reinvest in your own property 

cons 
 the user interface is just wonky its not nearly intuitive and there are so many things that make me irrationally angry
 controls are unnatural and i find myself constantly escaping out of menus i dont want to and losing track of my place in the catalog 
 some of the clients are a lot stricter than others and right now you cant see much detail about what specifically they didnt like although sometimes you can guess based on your choices 
 it is almost impossible to know the sizescale of an item before you place it particularly annoying with art rugs and plants 
 some stuff looks like you can change the swatch but you cant and then some stuff has like 9 things you can change so hard to tell where the line is
 having to paint every single wall panel floor tile etc individually 
 the roofing is kind of nightmarish but workable once you figure it out although large scale builds will prove tedious 

this is just the stuff that was at the top of my head after the first long playthrough  i definitely am looking forward to playing more and think for the price its a great game understanding that they wanted it to be free to play then having to deal with unity bs  its still at a fair number for what you get i really hope they continue to improve not only on the content but the actual mechanics and ui need a lot more love

#####

this is the only game i have ever asked for a refund on im usually not picky even if something has a few bugs ill wait it out see if it gets better but this game has so many bugs that it made the game completely unplayable in multiplayer mode it just crashed constantly the host didnt have any issues but the person to join the game would simply have their game stop working completely except for being able to walk around

by the looks of other reviews were not the first to mention this so if they havent addressed the issues yet i highly doubt they will

#####

has potential to be one of my all time favorite games but omg they neeeed to fix the bugs and make it so multiplayer can do its job says it can handle up to 10 people and cant even handle 2 also needs more cosmetics like options for installations and furniture

#####

this game has a lot of potential but its got some painful teething issues its in early access though so by the time you read this these issues will probably have been ironed out

1 the game seems to feature a small handful of aigenerated images depicting locations when you unlock them as you rank up they might not be aigenerated but if you look closely there are aspects of them that dont make sense and look amalgamated by a machine if these are aigenerated i hope that they are temporary placeholders and i implore the developers to replace these with real art as soon as they can
2 some levels appear to be bugged and impossible to complete i was doing a large home expansion job but no matter what i did an exterior wall piece and 2 roof coverings were always incomplete i spent about an hour on this before eventually giving up  and i was forced to quit the job for which i was unfairly penalised by losing a lot of hardearned reputation to sidestep this id suggest removing the penalty for quitting a job as a justincase measure for the user otherwise there is no way for the user to quit a job without incurring a penalty which sucks if you encounter a bug like this one
3 the ui will bug out at times especially when transitioning to room planning mode if you switch to it sometimes the game will zoom out but wont give you the option to assign rooms until you click it a second time
4 coop crashes much more often than not i bought this game specifically to play it alongside a friend but we cannot play together for longer than 5 minutes before the game freezes i am based in europe and my friend is in na so this might have something to do with it
5 i feel like tab should open the work requirements its a little clunky having to right click to release my cursor to move up to the little logo in the top left to click that for the jobs specifications when it could just be a case of tapping or holding tab for quick reference
6 trying to demolish things is very inaccurate and will frequently target a wall on the floor above or something youre not looking at
7 it would be nice if we could lock rooms when were done with them to prevent accidentally editing them while trying to work on a different room
8 it would be nice if there was a way to prevent exterior wall coverings from being used inside and vice versa but i realise this option wouldnt be to everyones taste as it would discourage experimentation
9 vintage stuff looks objectively awful most of it is all scratched up or worn down not all vintage items need to have seen a lot of prior use so some more polished vintage furniture would be a nice addition
10 it would be nice to filter things based on their quality 2 or above and their style scandinavian only etc
11 some objects have unexpected surface collision or lack thereof making it difficult or simply impossible to place decorations upon them

the game is very fun though im enjoying all types of jobs in this game and i cant wait to see how it turns out when its done

#####

the game was advertised as a sandbox game where you could build whatever you would like its understandable that it is a early access game but not include a sandbox mode on launch to show players the features of the game is not a great start

#####

with every new game there are going to be growing pains but the developers actually listen and take into consideration what the community is saying this is a cute little game where you can design and build either solo or with other people my husband and i play together to wind down from the day and it allows us to have some creative freedom we cant necessarily have in rl i am excited to see how this game progresses and develops in the coming months to years 

#####

right now the game is very choppy on the movement part which seems to be the same with quite a few people i disabled the music on the game and it also disabled the sound effect part of the game i would like to be able to have sound effects without music i didnt play that long because i couldnt deal with the lag movement of the game with the controls other than the lag on the movements i would recommend this game it would also be nice to change the controls to what you want

#####

the game does what it sets out to do  it is true as some say that the catalog is not yet extensive but it has enough choice for a game in development and i am confident given the feedback of the developer we will expect way more items in the future 

i experienced one bug in 4 hours play but it was minor and could be fixed by redoing a part of a build will forward it to the dedicated forum feed on which the developer is super active so all in all recommended

#####

cant play the game yet cause of performance issue i havent gone through most of the features and gameplay i have high hopes for this dev hopefully will get fixed later

#####

although i want to love and recommend this game i cant atm of course creative people can still do magic with available tools but the sims with placement cheat are still offering more options
 annoying and boring roof placement
 fixed 1x1 m grid
 walls only connect at 90 degree
 unrealistic lighting
 lack of proper autosnapping for furniture

many small bugs i can easily ignore and wait for the fix but but from the game about building and decorating i would expect more freedom and creativity

#####

im really surprised by the negative reviews here given this is in early access  i am really enjoying the game and thankful the devs have released it to the community we all know ea is not the final game and bugs are to be expected  so excited to play as updates push through

i played during the playtest and experienced some performance issues but whatever i was dealing with back then has since been patched and i am able to run the game pretty smoothly now 





#####

i can see a really good game here but as of me writing this it is far to glitchy if the game ever gets to a point where there arent any invisible items or things that should have been demolished not being demolished and the game not freezing every time something is placed then i would love to give it another try but as of now i need to refund

#####

i selected no i do not recommend because as numerous others have pointed out there are optimization issues galore in this game i have better than the recommended specs for this game way better than the minimum requirements and i cannot run it at any higher than medium without it stuttering and suffering severe frame rate drops however on medium it does work just fine  so if youre fine with that in the mean time go ahead and get it

the game has so much potential its good for what it is now its pretty theres plenty of creative routes you can take and its definitely a competitor of house flipper i didnt play it for too long because i just bought it to see if the reviews were accurate to mess around with the graphics settings and see how it would do on my computer and just get an overall feel for what it has to offer its comparable to hotel renovator with how it operates but laid out so much better its easy to understand and very user friendly

#####

i havent played a whole lot yet but house flipper is one of my favorite games and this one has an eyedropper tool the sacred unattainable tool weve been begging for in house flipper for years and multiplayer but no friends own it so i havent tried that i saw it has issues atm but its very early for it and i already think its solid looks great they improved on a bunch of stuff hf didnt flesh out or add in the cursor is a little annoying it does feel like its hovering in the wrong spot because its too far center of the item youre placing mainly walls those are the most annoying ones but its not a huge deal since you can see where youre placing said item before you commit i think theres a lot more they could add to improve it but i expect they will as this is early access although a lot of the reviews say multiplayer doesnt work right atm so if thats your ultimate goal with this i guess hold off til its fixed but overall im having fun  it runs on my deck too it could be optimized a little because its a little intensive on the poor guy but it does work on it and the controls feel nice on there so thats a bonus

#####

such a beautiful game but it needs a lot more work i wouldnt recommend paying for it

#####

i recommend waiting a bit but the game has potential

#####

this actually have potential to be good building game cmon im still believe next update it get better just like no man sky the legendary comeback


#####

this is an early access game and the content available reflects that if you want the full experience full sandbox more houses wait for full release

for now treat this as a paid demo  set a timer test it out for 90110 minutes and refund if the basics were enough to get you interested its not up to par yet

pros
 tutorial to teach the basics
 level up system and unlock rewards
 starter house to mess around in
 multiple available jobs pick how smallbig a task you want to do
 no penalty for placing 1 floorwall covering and then replacing it with another only charged the price difference

here are the issues i will be keeping an eye on for updates prior to purchasing
cons
 stale music no sound effects i lasted 30 mins before muting
 location of placing wall is based on the cursor position for the top of the wall not the base
 using room planner and clicking done disappears and centers cursor
 some visual bugs corners of building stay blank when exterior wall is finished on tutorial studio
 snap mode doesnt work for lining up kitchen cabinets
 no way to filter besides name such as by style
 loose tolerance for placing items inside walls bethesda mode
 some item scales dont make sense see pitcher of milk
 covering exterior walls completes the task and closes the item despite roof exterior walls being uncovered
 complete job button replaces view job button  if you want finish all tasks and want to double check you didnt pick something the client specifically dislikes like violet painted walls you cant
 some item model previews are rotated incorrect see outdoor tables
 no blocks for building intoonto outdoor plants
 no requirement for all of an item to be within a room for credit as being in room ex putting 1 leg of outdoor table within the room counts despite 90 of it hovering in the air outside

if all the issues were fixed i would recommend it at this price

#####

im gonna refund this for now i got annoyed and had a headache after 30 minutes  i feel like what we got is a scam i really wanted to play this watched youtube videos and now  the game is not finished it needs a lot of work
 no sanbox mode for early access game is a big nono 
 the furniture wallpaper and floors are barely visible through the white tiles so small i literally had a migraine trying to spot the patterns im not joking 
 the surroundings the grass or rather the lack of it is dead
 the grid doesnt work i couldnt span the kitchen cabinets together
 no option to paintput floor on the whole room at one shift like in the sims turning around camera is annoying
 the light in the game looks so fake it looks like the default light from unity you need to bring some life to that
 poor performance


im waiting for the updates and i want to play this game again but im not gonna spend my money for this not now

#####

its full of bugs and not everything functions as intended despite the good looking screenshots the game is very limited in what you can do and i also had difficulty recreating the screenshots too

for example
list
hitboxes for items are wrong and off some items cant be put against a wall even though it is supposed to be like a bathroom sink or toilet bowl
certain materials will make a floorspace filled and it means you cant put anything on there
missing certain building elements like pillars in real architecture things dont just freestand
things dont align with the world grid doors are too big shower rooms are too small
list

#####

the user interface is not user friendly i have played the tutorial three times and still have no idea how to play or where to find things major fail

#####

i have 450 hours in house flipper and was super hyped for this early access

i wouldnt recommend the game in its current state it runs absolutely terribly and has a lot of bugs it doesnt seem intuitive or maybe its broken when you right click to choose a different item and it closes out of everything and you need to open back to the items

so far theres a distinct lack of actual customizability on furniturewalls etc like one shade for each floor type no different woods for each wood panel style for example if you paint a door it paints the door handle as well  theres no way to do like half tile half paint walls and change the colours if you change the bed colours you can only change the top duvet thing not the framewood and some of the textures for that are broken too

removing rubbish is really clunky and seems like an afterthought put in to copy house flipper without the satisfactioncharm that it has in that game speaking of clunky some windows can only have their internal details painted from one side so you have to run around outside clicking the ones that dont work from inside
walls and floors are really clunky too assigning rooms uses a click and drag why cant the walls and floors do the same theres also no indication of which tile youre actually changing when hovering over things which again seems unintuitive

the jobs have strange algorithms or something because even if you match everything they likedont like sometimes youll just get 1 reviews anyway which is really annoying

also couldnt find a way to show all of a type of item ie modern you have to go into each subsection and look for them

there doesnt seem to be a way to modifychange the keybinds which is pretty sad in a new game

the game has promise but honestly has a long way to go

#####

dont buy sooo many issue with the game i was completely disappointed i have a high performance computer and the lag and delay was terrible they need to fix the issues before it is a good game i wish it ran better i would really love this game if it ran better

#####

i hope this game gets improved due to it being in early accessbecause it needs a lot of improvement

cons
game freezes when the other player tries to put down a window or door
the simple fired pottery is bugged
why are there no corner counters til rank 4
grid snapping doesnt look very good  when placing items against a wall there is a gap also cant centre items
some of the clients likes and dislikes dont fit with the rooms we have to renovate one guy wanted carpet in his kitchen and porch
mirror reflections are bugged
i hate how the shop catalogue closes when you move in first person
game is a bit laggy and the graphics inside homes dont look too great
ui is awful  hard to find things you want without clicking a million tabs
controls arent great  why is q  e rotate and r to open doors and clean things
toilets are too big compared to other bathroom items

only pros are that it has multiplayer and a lot of furniture options

#####

runs poorly even on a decent computer no sandbox mode yet poor optimisations and much much more

#####

not a bad game still has some glitches

#####

cant play the game offline tried to play with no internet and it said cant connect at this time classic drm on a single player game shameful

#####

great idea for a home remodel game but so insanely glitchy especially after the new updates the game constantly freezes and crashes even on the lowest settings which takes away from the beautiful aesthetics of the game also the content needs more variety most jobs have kids rooms to build but theres barely any kid content i want to love this game but its unplayable as it currently is please fix the issues and ill give a great review

#####

this game is the answer for people like me who enjoyed building bases and homes in survival games like icarus  i have played for over 250 hours and look forward to future developments in this game

#####

just not yet

the biggest problems for me are the little things
 snapping doesnt align correctly it either leaves a gap between a wall or puts furniture inside the wall so i had to use biting the tongue kind of precision which is not nice in a game like this
 walls dont always snap together so it looks horrible
 you cant delete some furniture after you put it in the house
 i dont like the animations for stuff like trash collecting
 the game is surprisingly slow but that might be a problem in my end

im definitely gonna come back to this someday but now it wasnt ready

#####

the items did not count in task could not delete or remove old items from work area ie old toiletsink tublight fixtures mirrors etc  sell  tab was greyed out  unable to use so frustrating even when update happensi still would not play this game i paid 19 for this mess  this game needs so much more work before it hits steam do not buy

#####

i love this game especially the sandbox mode so much customization the game has a bunch of potential excited for updates d

#####

i have mixed feelings about this game i see a lot of reviews based on performance in graphics which i agree with but i turned mine down so i can still play the rating system is actual dog poop i dont have a lot of items in the necessary ratings for certain clients and it makes my rating go down when i dont have enough of styles i usually put duplicating items  so i can make that quota for the room and then loose a rating when adding duplicating items in some cases some clients have likesdislikes that have a  what am i supposed to do based on that when they give you no information in the description ill put all items that the client likes and they still will give me a bad rating on top of all that after becoming level 7 or 8 they make you do these big renovationsjobs that have like 5 rooms to renovate and it takes forever to do just one job unless youre with a friend and you loose all motivation to do so the roofs are horrible and they dont latch together so some roof tiles will be sticking out addition to all that ive mentioned when i want to renovate the starter house they give you at the beginning of the game i dont get money back when i decide i dont like something or need to delete it i thought this game was going to be calming and not stressful but stressful is the vibes this game gives me this is just my opinion and its okay to not agree with me i understand its early access but they should take this feedback to help the game flow better

#####

great game but there needs to be a lot of fixes  
for example   sometimes you cannot move small objects off of shelves  
                        sometimes you cannot change the color of furniture  it just doesnt work  

also it would be great if they added
 add a creative only mode that has a larger area to build  i cant build my mansion  
 also make it so we can move chunks of a building  example  allow us to move the entire living room as one unit with everything in it  i want to be able to pick up my entire bedroom once im done making it and connect it to my living room that i have been working on separately  

honestly  it would be nice if your house was creative mode and you had endless exp and had access to all decorating items  i only like playing the game to build my own house  having to build other houses for npc quests is not fun  this would be better if it was just a creative on your own house builder  

add vaulted ceilings  

i really like the game but being able to pick up separate parts of the house and connect them to other parts needs to be added  i play with my sister and friends and we all complain about this

#####

a very nice building game with a lot of potential it has some bugs but its still in development sandbox mode would be nice
i cant wait for future updates
the game runs smoothly with high settings
intelr coretm i54690 cpu  350ghz   350 ghz 160 gb ram


#####

the game had promise in the beginning but somewhere along the development line it went wrong and now suffers from very poor performance on decent hardware bugged settings that dont work and the overall look of the game just looks rough almost like it was a forgotten school project that had a rush job to get finished and handed in on time

update 03122023  game still terrible choppy frame times have to play on low to medium  capping fps to make work resolution keeps changing on its own and settings dont stick once applied

not sure whats going on with the game as it used to be good but yeah if you want a solid experience then play house flipper instead

#####

i have played this game this evening for a couple of hours and can gladly say its extremely pleasant cannot wait to put more hours in already exactly what i enjoy from other similar games 

looking forward to future updates and further content  could not recommend this game more also the multiplayer is a game changer as now it means that we can team up to create excited for sandbox mode 

keep up the amazing work you have not received enough credit for this creation

#####

i had this game on my wish list for some time i removed it when they were mentioning nfts but they decided to not go down that route so im thankful for that i was given beta access which had some performance issues now im here in ea and have zero performance issues and my set up isnt that great
the game itself is everything i wanted and more they will be adding sandbox mode later on not sure why people are dishing out negative reviews when it does state that mode will be added later
yes there are bugs its ea the devs listen to the community so hopefully all will be fleshed out in future patchesupdates
overall i recommend this to any house building sims fans

#####

15fps on 3080 ultrawide resolution is unplayable interface takes half of the screen

#####

this game is great at what it wants to do and as someone who only ever wanted to play the sims purely to build houses i love it i do hope we get more furnishings and decor what there is now is great but i think the game would truly shine with even more options availible

#####

this seems very unfinished and amateurish in its current state a week or so after early access release its not so much the bugs that bother me but basic gameplay mechanics that are completely missing or broken  load  save savegames sandbox mode editable key bindings or mouse controls terrible ui no way to look at more than one other house etc  loads of people also seem to have performance issues that render the entire game unplayable not me thankfully 


the build mode mechanics are pretty underwhelming from what ive seen so far a few positive aspects 

 the ability to place doorswindows freely unlike in most other games albeit without the option to use a grid or see measurements which makes this feature really difficult to use
 the ability to edit lot size  split lots
 the ability to build right up to the edge of a lot


but thats about it  theres no way to edit wall height build attics basements slanted or diagonal walls split levels terraforming or anything like that 


apart from that the catalog items look like a hodgepodge of random freeware meshes to me insane poly count crappy texture mappingscaling weird proportions  and since the ui is clunky and overly complicated to use its not a lot of fun to try and pick out a few that one might like 


so yeah i was expecting this to be fun it ishouldi be right up my alley given that i spent more hours than anyone can count in sims 234 build mode but in its current state it isnt im going to take another look in a few months or weeks and play something else until then

#####

i totally agree the best bit of the sims making dream homes but really needs the ability to sell and make a profit so you can buy more land and build your housing empire love the designs and the possibilities for the game

#####

gets hired to build a deck
guy says he loves carpeting
not sure what kind of lunatic wants a carpeted deck but whatever hes the client
pay gets docked for putting carpet on a deck
still get a 5 star review
use money to build myself an uncarpeted deck

#####

i was excited for this game but extremely disappointed once getting it its really gitchy which i could have overlooked if the controls werent so aggravating and the game play was actually fun but the game just came off like a really bad ripoff of house flipper makes me sad as i think the game had potential but really needs to be developed more ive requested a refund

#####

i like this game i was excited when it was going to be freetoplay but once it was announced that itd be a full fledged paid game after the unity nightmare i was much more interested i really hate games that feel like they are constantly asking for money to make things go by faster or unlock that one special object and you can kind of see where that might have been before with the timers over certain jobs on the main map 

pros
its a full game with no aggressive monetisation after purchase if there were expansion packs after the game is finished thatd be pretty cool
multiplayer
easier building than house flipper
cheap
an actually good tutorial
straightforward ui

cons
its very grainy antialiasing would go a long way towards making this game look better
surprisingly heavy on my gpu i have an rx 6750xt i beat baldurs gate 3 on max settings with this gpu never missing a beat why does this game make my fans try to launch into the atmosphere not optimised 
object funkiness the objects will easily clip through walls and its not super clear on where you are placing things sometimes and if youll be clipping an object through walls also snapping doesnt automatically make duplicated things line up like stairs

overall the game needs some work but its enjoyable enough at the beginning and itll only get better

#####

as an avid sims and house flipper player i was really looking forward to hometopia 

my favourite element of this game is the realism of design that you dont get with house flipper the contract includes some likes and dislikes though some are just picky but you decide on the pieces the guidelines took some getting used to eg a minimalist wants more items than specified in the brief but once that was clear i have really enjoyed the game play i have also liked the different job specs so if i dont fancy building multiple new rooms i can just do a renovation job i have not tried multiplayer yet so i cant comment on that 

still some crashing and the graphics arent always brilliant even on ultra but overall i like the concept of this game

#####

this game is off to a good start there are a good amount of options when it comes to building the ui that they use works for what you need however it still feels very restricting some notes to the dev team that i have maybe consider adding these things in the near future would be to allow for pitched ceilings on the interior you can do slanted roofs but not ceiling and curvature it would be cool to be able to have curved walls or a dome ceiling or even diagonal walls there are a  decent amount of options when it comes to decor furniture cabinetry etc and im sure the dev team will add more as the game develops more and more it has only had 3 updates since release its still very new this games success depends on if the dev team keeps adding more stuff because currently the game isnt there yet and thats ok 

also i found that changing the material of things is pretty inconsistent some doors will let you change the material to whatever you want and some dont overall a fun game for simple projects if you want something that can get more detailed and complicated this game just isnt there just yet but i do believe it has the potential to get there

#####

this game definitely has potential the designs are kind of outdated in my opinion and the way to move is a little wonky but fun game to play to pass the time

#####

honestly i still bought the game despite the bad reviews  its in early acesss bugs are expected me and my friend have played this for 5 hours together  finally a simulationbuilding game you can play with friends bugs were minimal on my end the game has so much already for being early access would recommend to anyone who enjoys house flipper this is better imo

#####

unless you have the best pc specs dont buy this it is laggy and no matter how good your pc is it has so many bugs its unbelievable maybe later in the games lifespan itll be better but right now only buy it if you really really are desperate to play a home construction game with your friends or family

#####

i gave this game more than a fair chance maybe if they added in a sandbox mode it would be worth it takes way to long to make money and half the time even if you do everything to an exact that the client wants you still never can get it good its almost like stuff isnt tagged properly

#####

as a house flipper fan i was excited to see this game i do not recommend the game in its current state i hope they role out updates soon once they get have some bugs ironed out and add some more items i will definitely be back

#####

this game has a lot of potential ive just started out but wanted to make a short list of things i think need to be fixed first before others so far these things are broken and affect game play

the item style types are not attributed correctly on items like flooring walls etc when viewing decor many items have a style for example modern vintage scandinavian etc however the floors and walls say the style type is flooring and wallpaper etc i think this needs to be addressed since jobs require you to specifically follow the clients style taste i had a client really dislike a room i styled and i can only guess the floor or wallpaper was a style they didnt like but i was unaware of

second the popup dialog options when reviewing a new job are unreadable in some places the text box containing the message from the client is covered by the ok or whatever button in the middle


also lots of folks are upset with the graphics but honestly the game looks good and i am a visual person and it doesnt bother me in any way its not ultra 4k fancy fps but its fine i am excited to see this game evolve i play other games like sims solely for the home building and hometopia actually gives me more freedoms in some ways like being able to place a door pretty much anywhere on the wall instead of it snapping to only certain places

#####

love it im super excited to dive in and spend more time in this game the graphics are fantastic and the level of detail and control is top notch with mortgage rates so high this may be my best shot to finally have my dream midcentury modern home  and i can hire expert builders to help me very cool game

#####

the performance for this game is unacceptable even for early access low settings on an 8700k with a 2070 super and 32gb of ram on an ssd getting like 2030 fps
 and within the like 30 minutes i played  the game is very clunky

#####

so far the game is unplayable for me its a nightmare to place furniture 
if i want 4 exactly the same kitchen cabinets i have to select it from the catalog place one then it disappears from my cursor so i have to go to the catalog again and select it again and just like that i have to select it 4 times from the catalog if i want to have 4 of those  in house flipper you can place more of the same thing automatically in the sims placing something while holding shift gives you the same ability you could just do something like that
if you want furniture to be nicely evenly placed you have to hold shift and it will be placed by the grid great and easy right but for some reason the grid doesnt match with walls  or other furniture  so you cant have your furniture nicely evenly placed by the grid theres no way to do this

i know its only early access tho ill probably buy the finished game anyway ill hope that most of the issues will be fixed by then

i also have a problem with overall building the game was described as a building simulator not as a decoratingfurnishinginterior design simulator but then its not possible to have attic rooms i tried doing anything with the roof but its impossible placing windows in attic in any way neither roof windows nor lucarnes also how am i supposed to fit some walls under the roof to make the highest floor rooms if there are only 2 wall heights available also the roofs dont connect with each other in any intuitive way also no possibility for diagonal or round walls no possibility to build basements or semibasements with small windows no possibility to make walls and ceilings lower or higher than the default height 

if it was advertised and described as interior designfurnishingdecorating game like house flipper was i wouldnt raise any of those issues but according to the steam description it was supposed to be a building simulator and yet we have less possibilities with building than in the sims which isnt even mostly about building also due to the furniture placing issues i described in the beginning of my review hometopia at this point isnt even good as a fun interior design game

this was very disappointing tbh with that being said ill most likely buy the finished game when it gets released the overall concept for the game seemed cool and i hope the developers will take into account the users review about all the issues that are in the game right now

#####

its like the sims and house flipper had a baby

#####

i wanted to like this game so much it was everything i needed it to be before trying it for real
1st cant run it although i can run elder ring in high with minimal problems with this game even in low i have max 20 fps this is outrageous
2nd how can you design a ui so poorly the menu takes half of the screen the camera is sketchy at best the texts zones dont fit in the designated areas so you cant entirely read them

i make the miskate of letting the game in pause mode so they wont refund me

such a shame really it was promising

#####

unfortunately i cant really say much about the games content as such because as others have stated the performance is abysmal

im running the game on a pc built around a 3070ti and i reach a maximum of 35 fps on lowest settings at 1080p while the gpus usage is at 100

i probably wont issue a refund because id like to support the idea of the game and im still holding out hope for the devs to fix this but from a technical standpoint the current state is unacceptable and i can not recommend spending your hardearned money on this unless youre a hardcore enthusiast for this kind of game and are willing to look past the performance issues

#####

cozy games are my weakness and this game has become one of my favourite games to play in my spare time although i havent got a lot of hours on this game ive unlocked so many perks already and each house is a different task this game doesnt get boring i can play it for hours

also i will leave this cute cat here so that everybody who passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards

#####

it pains me to do this and i dont really want to write my review based on multiplayer alone because on paper i really like the game and the single player is functional

however for me multiplayer is absolutely broken ive gotten kicked several times for no reason even though my partner the person i was playing with lives less than 3 miles away from me and my internet is fine

additionally after some playtime less than an hour i cant do anything anymore every object i place gets removed but the money is subtracted from my balance and foundations that i build cant be removed or have a room assigned to important to note is i wasnt hosting my partner was for them everything worked

after some point i can see my partner making changes but only very selectively i could see them place windows but not walls for example

the game also doesnt run great i have a 3060 ti and a ryzen 7 5700g but i cant even get 60fps on medium on 1080p

i also find the selection cursor a little annoying it feels like its selecting whats right on top of the cursor and sometimes it feels like its a few pixels off

i really hope these issues get patched the game seems fun and im 100 willing to change my review to positive if these issues get fixed

#####

its alright but theres definately room for improvement 

cons clients are just as finnicky as in real life interior design but you dont get to have a back and forth conversation with them on what they like so you are a bit hampered by that so i think the difficulty in interpreting what the client wants is a bit unrealistic there isnt many options for kitchens even once you unlock the whole catelog very few options when it comes to upper cabinets and it would be nice if you could snap cabinets together so that you dont have to fiddle with the placement so much itd also be nice if they could snap to the walls so you dont have accidental big gaps this is something house flipper did better the grid snapping mechanic is weak and difficult to use and the options for colors is limited by a selection of predetermined colors instead of allowing you to customize the color which makes it a bit harder to match some of the walls together but this is pretty par for the course for these games its dissapointing that they removed the sandbox at least that it is no longer a true sandbox the freedom of creativity was something i was looking forward to but now im limited by money and experience which is something i want to escape from in my interior design sims the sims has cheats to can use and the ability to edit lots your sims arent on in order to achieve this house flipper the other game this is compared to is more in line with how this game seems to be going however its much easier to satisfy clients in that game so farming up enough money to create a pseudosandbox is much easier in that game 

pros still in development as of writing this review so well see where it goes still a chance to improve especially since they are supposedly taking constant feedback not sure where to do that other than here though its nice having the option between first person and overhead as it makes it easier to tell what you are doing the job interface is very easy to navigate and understand they make it very simple to find everything you need for the job i like how customizable the furniture and such is you can put any material anywhere and then change its color to whatever you like havent given the multiplayer aspect a try but the fact that it even exists is very cool and its nice that you can team up with people i just dont have friends who share my interest in interior design

overall im hopeful for the future but it isnt complete enough yet to warrant the price if you have the money to spare go ahead and buy the game so we can support the developers in making this the building sim we hoped itd be but if youre trying to decide between this and another game with your limited funds i would wait a bit on this one its still got a lot of potential but its not there yet

personal feelings disappointed but hesitantly hopeful

#####

 poor optimization
 low quality graphics
 very poor 3d models
 textures very low quality
 boring repetitive jobs
 no sandbox mode
 looks really rushed even for early access

 nice environments becuase this is the only thing that it was not done by them

dont recommend in current state

#####

i was really excited to play this game with my friends but the missions are so bugged that its almost unplayable i take jobs and get loaded into a blank lot with no objectives and the only way to select a new job is to quit the bugged one which tanks my reputation it looks like a super fun game and i want to play it but these bugs are super annoying cant wait for the devs to iron them out so i can enjoy it

#####

you can kind of do what you want in a sort of cookie cutter wayeverything on a grid how about making a driveway how about a recliner home theater im sure more to come but a decentish start

#####

h3 the great h3
 foundational elements are there for a great sandbox interior design platform 
 transparent roadmap frequent updates and dev communication

h3 the good h3
 career mode is surprisingly enjoyable your choices do make a difference in job outcome even if its  surface level the limited assets and progression lead you to think outside of the box with design choices it eventually becomes a little repetitive though
 lighting and reflective textures look great the lighting through windows light sources and even light refraction correlate with realistic expectations of how it would work in real life you can manually set the time and weather conditions to see how it impacts the space

h3 the annoying h3
 performance optimizations like has been mentioned in other reviews higherend hardware can get some good looking outputs though and highfps can be somewhat forgiven with the type of game this is updates seem to be addressing this each time and hopefully will reach a state that more players can work with
 asset variety youll quickly become annoyed in sandbox mode with the very limited number of assets in specific categories kitchen lower cabinets only match a handful of upper cabinet designs a handful of refrigerators where only one actually has the texturefidelity to even look decent in a kitchen youll find like 4 variations of an asset that id never think to place and 0 or 1 of a very common household item few stair assets and the ones with railings dont have matching railings under the railings asset section
 tooling is still buggy or lacking features cant mirrorrotate doors or windows meaning door handles and direction they open are completely fixed dragging surfaces will sometimes stop randomly or be restricted for no reason extruding corners of walls dont respect the painttexture and are a fixed beige color you see this is in every screenshot in the community tab if you look close enough

hrhr

overall a decently fun time for the price 20 off sale and clearly has a ton of potential if you accept that sandbox isnt ready to be a true sandbox and that there will be bugs or features that simply wont support the things you want to do even if they seem trivial then you can get your value out of this if the developer can meet most of its roadmap timeline this game will be really amazing in one years time

#####

i really wanted to like this game but i think it is more annoying than anything there are very few choices of items to begin with and then when your client asks you for certain styles and you try and stick to it you are either going to get the penalty for using outside of the style or using the same item more than once even though sometimes it just makes sense to do so

#####

barely 60fps at 1080p on medium on an rtx 3080 ti  i911900k such a dissappointment

#####

amazing game to be played with friends i mean it does have few bugs but nothing a reconnect doesnt fix i highly recommend it if you enjoy coop games despite what other negative review clowns may say this game is worth every penny and what we can do is support the devs to fix these minor bugs definitely 810 even at its current state now that sandbox is here this game became amazing

#####

edited review
the game is still quite slow and obviously needs improvements around graphics handling some of the controls also feel a bit janky though maybe im not used to them im coming from a sims 34 housebuilding point of view rather than something like house flipper overall it is still getting better and i can slightly recommend the game now given that it is in early access and deserves some grace 

the game is playable on medium settings so although it wont look amazing for most it still looks pretty good i bought it purely for sandbox mode and theyve added that in the caveat is that because it is still not the bestoptimised game it takes a long time to build things in medium graphics quality because the fps isnt great for me im on an amd ryzen 4000 and a geforce rtx


first review on launch
i cant recommend it right now its just too laggy you can only play on the lowest settings i put it on medium and was getting around 10fps and i can run cyberpunk on good graphics the game needs optimisation even on the lowest setting i got at max 20fps whilst building

also i bought it specifically so i could just mess around and build houses the promo material made it seem like that was the core and that career mode is an added extra however that isnt the case  there doesnt seem to be a way to do sandbox mode and just build a house you have to do several career events before you can afford to buy land so the main thing i wanted is locked away without a sandbox mode i dont think ill play that much im just not into renovation games

#####

finally i can afford to own a home

#####

i think for an early access the game does a pretty solid job ofc it has its bugs but none of them are like that bad that the game would be unplayable whatsoever i found myself really having fun with the high ammount of possibilities i am really looking forward to the sandbox mode i hope it will have a coop mode as well keep your work up

#####

elephant in the room  this game was supposed do be a free download dlc to be purchased  then unity changed their tos so the devs made the decision to sell the game but the dlc will be included from what i understood from their explanation 

the game is unfinished unoptimized and a bit grindy  but i am really enjoying this  if you like building games this one has real potential  i am excited to see what this game will become

#####

im so disappointed which is sad because how much i loved this game before all the glitches i had 45 hrs of game play with no issues i loved coming home and playing the game loved all he little details however all of the sudden my profile was completely wiped my husband spent hours and he was able to retrieve about 20 hours of game play back after the third time of the game deleting itself im just done i have tried everything to save this game because i loved it so much but not worth the constant hours of game play being loss

#####

this game is a total nightmare so far 

i dont have a qwerty keyboard so i had to improvise a solution to be able to play a mix between mouse and controller since theres no way to remap keyboard controls and i hate to play with my keyboard 

and whats more i cant even finish the tutorial 
for example the game requires you to build an extra room studio outside the house and asks you to put in windows but the game doesnt tell you where to put the windows how are you suppose to know and when you dont put them in the right place  it stops you from painting the walls

so im going to wait until they get the basics right before trying again  or not 
ill just get a refund for now


#####

fantastic enjoyed the gameplay and intuitive controls and decorative selections  did not experience any glitches or bugs  if you like building and decorating you will most likely enjoy this casual gaming experience

#####

i love the concept of this game but the in game rating system is awful im meeting all requirements but still get given a 1 star which is really frustrating also when applying some paint or wallpapers its not covering the walls properly so its showing the old dirt patches the cleaning up is also a little basic rather than using just a dust pan and brush it would be nice for it to be more interactive ill wait to play this again until some of the bugs are fixed so right now i dont recommend playing this game just yet

#####

i like the smooth running of the game and the different perspectives you can have using the f key the range of materials colours etc is amazing i have only been playing for a short time and have earned an excellent reputation the ability to move the sun so you can get a better view is a valuable addition however i would like to be able to go back after the completion and change things to give myself the chance to get the full star rating if something didnt quite go the way the client wanted or at least getting the feedback specifying what i did wrong by the client  when you get a comment like a 3yearold could have made that which i saw when i first started could be discouraging to some players

#####

so far i find the game very enjoyable yes there are some bad performance issues doesnt make it unplayable though couldnt help but notice most comments are already bashing the game when its been in early access for 4 days people expect perfection on day 1 its early access for a reason gamers  a lot of games to this day still have game breaking bugs and performance issues never fixed cut these guys some slack and give em time i look forward to see what they do

#####

it has its quirks but its still brand new the starting house has some frame drop issues and theres some desync when playing with others theres also some things that could be adjusted to improve overall qol but im having fun with it

#####

joya pa
 
add achievements 

#####

after 40 hrs of gaming i can say this game has tons of promiseive played both sims 4 and house flipper this game has a nice mix of both game elements despite the bugs its a good time investor and will only get better with time

#####

i want to give this a thumbs down because the game still has lots of bugs and glitches its expected tho bcs its still early access but i gave it a thumbs up because im a good girl  


#####

game is early access but i am seeing improvements in the game as time goes on i have been looking for a good building game and this seems to fill the bill

there are still several things i would like to see added to the game but that is what early access is all about

#####

this game is actually really fun you guys are just horrible at it

edit okay this game sucks

#####

makes no sense forcing people to play the career mode i just want to play a sandbox mode and i am not wiling to spend time earning money with the jobs

poor graphic optimization makes the game very hard to play even on reasonable good hardware hope this get better soon

update nov 9th 2023
huge update sandbox mode and awesome performance improvements

#####

very fun game  compared to the sims its a much more capable building tool but i think the jobs give the game its own room to shine  its especially nice for someone like me who doesnt know much about design and gets intimidated by too many options  this game eases you into it  def worth trying

#####

overall i havent had any issues with the game and enjoyed the time i have played so far i think it runs pretty well though i have seen many others say it has some performance issues the snap to grid and the grid system as a whole is pretty meh as the grid often doesnt start flush with the edge of the room so i often have furniture clipped through walls or with a good gap away from the wall im also noticing a little issue with trying to appease clients often i find myself paying close attention to the things i put in the rooms according to the client preferences price quality style etc and yet at the end the client still has items they dont like its not a gamebreaker for me but a little bit of an annoyance when i sacrificed things i wanted to include but didnt because it didnt fit with the clients preferences are there things i would change about this game absolutely am i going to keep playing yes do i regret buying no and will likely buy dlc as it comes out i just hope the game becomes a little bit more polished as time goes on

#####

ive played the game for a little over two hours and here are my thoughts so far

the game is fun and relaxing with beautiful graphics and lovely background music the controls while a little wonky at times are easy to remember and use there are a lot of ways to move the camera around and get the angle you wantneed for placing furniture which i like and speaking of furniture there are a ton of items to choose from yes things are locked until you start leveling up which is a bit of a bummer but there are still so many options to choose from in the beginning especially clutter items the jobs you can play are fun to do but also provide a decent challenge in trying to get the perfect 5 star score i also like having the option to customize furniture items overall its been a nice two hours and i definitely recommend the game

since it is early access i hope there will be some features added in the future such as
 free mode vs career mode it would be nice to choose between unlocking items while ranking up in a career mode or simply being able to play with all items unlocked in a free mode that just allows you to decorate without ranking or challenges it just would be cool to have some different options
 better item customization while i do like that items can be customized period i think this feature needs some improvement
 better kitchenbathroom counters i would like to see the ability to slot and connect counters together in an easier way using shift to turn on the grid allows furniture items to snap into place but doesnt actually let you put kitchen counters together easily it does make building big kitchens kind of tedious so this is something id like to see worked on more corner options would be nice too

other than the few things above im really impressed with the game i cant wait to see what features will be added in the future

#####

well this game gets a thumbsdown from me and ive had it sitting on my wish list longer than ive had some of my forgotten leftovers in the fridge its like a neverending cycle of disappointment every time i try to start a new job in this game it freezes on the loading screen

the music oh boy it starts out fine but then it goes all staticky like its auditioning for a role in a horror movie so i did what any sane person would do  turned off the music and played in eerie silence like a psychopath

now lets talk about the controls who in their right mind decided that r should be the interact button instead of e its like they wanted us to get hand cramps and carpal tunnel syndrome while playing 

and if you dare to set the graphics to anything higher than medium well the game turns into a slowmotion marathon like trying to race a snail through a river of molasses

but fear not my fellow gamers theres a silver lining you can hold down shift to place objects on a grid which is like trying to organize a chaotic room with a bulldozer  but it sort of helps with the overlapping issues some poor souls are experiencing

its as if this game is a race car missing a few wheels and the developers are on a pit stop mission the developers seem like they want to make it better so ill just sit back and wait like a patient parent watching their kid learn to ride a bike with square wheels

#####

gotta be careful not to spend too much time on this lol great game and i cant wait to build my dream home

#####

if youre thinking about purchasing this expecting a complete package then thats not exactly whats available today

ibthe early access rough edges are on full display herebi

thats fine considering that this game still offers features i so desperately want out of games like house flipper and the sims that being

     multiplayer with an openneighbourhood style coop where friends can work on separate plots simultaneously

     niceer lighting and rendering with global illumination and shading so builds can look close to architectural 3d design without having to actually use unreal engine yourself

     a completely free sandbox mode where the whole library of materials plots and decor are available from the start

the first two are working well today apart from a few visual bugs and pretty awful performance on the highest graphics setting which is how the game is advertised however that last one is now a bit of a sore subject since i was hoping to log on today and immediately start building something in a sandbox mode ithat was not the casei
unless i have to complete more of the objectives to reach that feature which would be a bit annoying since i have exactly izero interesti in cleaning up trash and working to someone elses instructions especially when their instructions are to paint the walls garish colours b u there is no sandbox feature currently in the game u b and it costs a massive amount of currency to be able to buy a plot somewhere and start working so i have to say im really disappointed in that especially since it felt like a pretty obvious selling point in all the promotion

b im still really invested in the development of this game and since i was never able to access the private beta im thankful to be able to hop in and experience things myself while it progresses and im certainly not unhappy to part with i only 13 i to be a part of that b

im excited to see where this goes ill be checking in often to see when ill be happy enough with the features available to drop a ton of time into it to make the positives clear when the graphics behave on the highest settings b the renderinglighting does look really nice b leagues ahead of house flipper for example multiplayer works pretty well and connecting to friends seems quite seamless theres clearly a large library of materials furniture and decor items in the game even if they arent available until you reach all the ranks
but for now heres what i think the priorities need to be for the developers

ubsandbox modebu
my sentiment that this is a prime unique selling point for players seems to be echoed in other reviews here and comments ive seen online so having this feature available from the start or even just after the initial tutorial is a necessity once its in any other issues i have are relatively minor inconveniences
a career mode is clearly a good choice to keep more casual players engaged and feel rewarded for learning all the mechanics im sure a lot of people will love this feature but i just personally have no interest in a house flipper style story mode

ubaudio bugsbu
theres a slider for all audio as well as a music but it seems like the music slider also affects all other sounds in the game and since i would much rather listen to my own music while playing i basically played with the whole game on mute i would never expect a simulation game to provide enough unique music to not get horrendously repetitive i just need functional volume sliders
u
bimproved placement mechanicsbu
i had a really tough time aligning things in the way i wanted as well as completely free placement there is a snapping grid and a nice aligning feature that worked i sometimes i but the grid seems global and doesnt account for the varying sizes of rooms resulting in awkward gaps and misaligned counter tops i probably spent 20 minutes of the first hour just trying to align a kitchen counter manually since the automatic snapping couldnt figure it out i understand this must be a very difficult system to develop with the emphasis on total design freedom but it should be a high priority i dont want to waste time fiddling with this

ubimproved user interfacebu
all the ui menus feel decidedly b janky b in some way or another the toolbar for selecting furniture is huge and obscures too much of the screen when im trying to place things it should be hidden or shrink somehow once youve selected an item theres no reason why after closing the toolbar to get a better look at what im doing i should have to click through each individual category to find my way back to the items i was just looking at also the search field seems to be critical in finding matching styles of furniture since theres no way to sort them based on that but in my experience searching is so slow and buggy that its rendered basically unusable

also finally this is a personal request and i understand that it cant be a huge priority since im sure its a lot easier said than done to implement but all the houses feel so american not to say that cant be beautiful but the way everything is built on a platform of foundations the height of walls how i square and angular i everything is the way neighbourhoods and cities are laid out and the types of structural materials available are mostly so typical of american domestic architecture this is something that always disappointed me about games like the sims and house flipper so any movement towards more options with this would be really exciting i can see myself only using the plots in the mountain landscapes so i can pretend for now but they do feel distinctly i lonely i
as i said i realise this would be probably one of the hardest things to develop in a game like this since its all built on a foundation no pun intended of regimented grids but all the layouts feel really b uninspiring b for me because of that

overall there are a few fairly simple adjustments that can be made hopefully soon to make this worth sinking a lot of time into right now and overlooking all the rough edges

#####

homebuilders paradise

if you play the sims or other homebuilder games youll pick this game up pretty quickly all of the customization options are incredible and building just a pure joy cant wait to try out coop and sandbox mode this game seems like a mustplay for anyone who loves crafting their perfect virtual home

#####

you can fix the fps issue by enabling upscale but only at 60 do not go above high or ultra preset it doesnt give much of a different but will chunk massive performance

performance aside this game is really fun detailed to every aspects specific criterias customization coop every other stuff just works flawlessly

#####

i first saw this game right before early access release after being excited to try the game out and finally playing it is definitely worth the price i usually play games like the sims and house flipper and one thing that stands out right away is the customization it has to offer you can literally change the color fabric etc of basically anything i really enjoyed playing the first couple work tasks and cant wait to play more 1010 for me

#####

i havent been able to load this game at all it just keeps crashing every time i tried to load it im crying

#####

i played the alpha before and its come such a long way i really love house flipper and this give me the same vibes i needed a new game to play than the sims and house flipper and this is the perfect game to shake things up the graphics are really good and i cant wait for them to optimize better so i can play in that the maximum mode right now i just play in medium and will take pictures on high would recommend if you like building games like house flipper and sims

#####

ive been playing solidly since the release and although there are some minor bugs a bit of performance issues its a really fun game with a lot of future potential if you love houseflipper youll love this gem i cant wait to see how this game evolves

#####

game still being in early access its not bad grab it on sale
its a layback relaxed game for people who love to design create and build

gameoptimization is needed for sure
some features are not working perfectly like reputation and jobs but the idea is getting along
has huge potential but devs will need to take a big leap towards new features and bug fixing as well

cant wait for patches and updates 


#####

fun game i enjoyed it

#####

i really like this game and i would recommend it however there are a few bugs bc it is still in early release so just be mindful of that if you dont think you would be able to play with some of the things ive listed as well as others maybe wait for a bit for more updates to come out the devs have uploaded a roadmap of what they are going to be doing to improve the game and it seems to be on par with the reviews ive read its refreshing to have devs that actually listen to players

a couple problems ive noticed
snapping system snapping is a bit wonky the grid is never even with the room so you cant place things evenly
counterscabinets i cant figure out how to get counterscabinets to snap together i spent hours trying to get multiple to stick together because one cabinetcounter doest make sense i tried using snapping but there was always a big gap i tried doing it freely but you cant ever get it to be perfectly together  there will always be some overlap or gap and it will always be slightly behind or in front of the other idk if im missing something but i spent forever trying to figure it out with no avail
the music there is no option to change just the music volume lvl and i usually turn the music down in games bc i like just the sound effects the music is a bit loud and can get repetitive so it would be good to have different volume options for master music sound effects etc 
walls sometimes when placing objects they overlap into walls and you can see them poking through to the next room im not sure if it affects ratings or not but it still is really bothersome and triggers my ocd lol
rating system the rating system seems random im still not sure how it works bc i get deductions for things that dont make sense i had a job to make a living room and put a decorative candle on a table i got a deduction for having a fire hazard in a childrens room it was a living room and there wasnt even a mention of children in the job overview i had another job where in the overview the client wanted me to be as thrifty as possible so i put the minimum decorations used cheapest furnitureappliances in their quality range and was deducted for being a penny pincher

despite the issues ive listed i still really enjoy the game if you like games like the sims or house flipper you will love this game there are so many customization options and its fun that there is a career aspect to it so you have to try to design stuff that clients will like not just what you think looks good so theres a challenging aspect to it while still being a super cozy game sandbox mode is also coming in the future so theres that to look forward to i saw a couple reviews of people saying the game ran poorly on high end pcs but i havent had too many performance issues other than some lag after playing for quite a few hours playing on my i710700 16gbram gtx1660ti the game is still in er so i know that some things are going to be a bit buggy but i am excited to play this game and watch it improve 

if anyone knows how to put multiple counters and cabinets together please tell me if there really isnt any way to snap two or more together hopefully it will be fixed in future updates

#####

ive played about 13 hours of this game the tutorial is a little buggy but after that everything is good again
i have played the game on several graphics settings it plays well on my system except entering a new job on max settings so just like other games just use these settings for taking photos but dial it back to high or ultra both seem to run well i wish there was a better way to hide the ui or hud or whatever you wanna call it for taking a nice clean photo other than that really enjoying the game that said i enjoy building games so maybe its already a preference for me i would recommend this game to a friend

#####

the lag and motion blur is unbearable literally couldnt get past the first few tutorial pop ups

#####

sure

#####

i love causing chaos in this game with my friends its lots of fun

#####

loved the idea of a house building game apart from the sims game hometopia is a great game so far had playtested during the summer months and liked the idea of a house building game i first heard about hometopia when they released a demo of sandbox version during steamfest 2023 any way those that like the career mode which i liked you do house renovations jobs and earn topian coins in game and then you save up to build your dream home today that changed while they still have career mode they have added a very much requested feature sandbox mode yes you choose what type of land and city or mountain scenery and then with an unlimited budget you build your dream home i was waiting for that feature and now it is available since todays update number 2 hometopia runs very smooth on my computer before have had some trouble running smoothly today that was fixed with update #2 great job hometopia developers i give hometopia five stars

#####

i thought i would build my dream house in a game and have free money

#####

consideting its the early access i think the game is great i really enjoyed the gameplay the best part of house flipper for me is completing jobs so starting with the client mode suits my preferences 

there are some issues with graphics but i play on the lowest settings and its fine with me other reviewers mentioned that their rating system doesnt work correctly however it works fair on my end it indeed would be great if we could see how clients rating progresses as we proceed with the renovations and what exactly they didnt like in the end but i tried to follow all availiable requirements and at rank 7 have the good rating 

unfortunately i came across a bug that doesnt let me move forward with the game taking the large renovation job for mindy young when the rooms were already assigned the small kitchen was too small of a size and although i managed to places the required furniture it still shows i didnt fully complete the room because its too small there is no build mode availiable as its an interior job so i cant change the size and therefore complete the job the only things i believe i can do is to quit the job which will lower my rating or wait for this bugjob requirement to be fixed i chose the latter 

overall the game is great the price as for me is fair and i would deffinetely recommend it im sure the final release version will get to my top3 best games ever

#####

i realy like thhis game so far once you get it with what the costumers want its pretty easy to reachh their goals i enjoy renovating two or three houses then i quit there game and pick it up again before i head to bed its cozy its fun the only thing i could complain about is that all costumers only seem to like vintage or scandinavian styles so every room kind of looks the same and there is a lack of decoration but its an early accsess game so i suppose there could come more objects

#####

i am not that creative so i actually really love the job system it is helping me get inspiration for what to build on my own but i could play for hours just on the jobs they can be really sassy sometimes which is funny to me havent had the issues with reputation ive seen others talk about but i think they did a patch before i bought the game that fixed it i feel like i got a hang of it really quickly and can see myself spending a lot of time playing and im looking forward to playing with my friends because that something house flipper is seriously missing loving the game so far

#####

this game does not perform well on wide screen monitors at 5120 x 1440 resolution a lot of the screen and menu options are off screen making it impossible to navigate and at times youll have to force quit the game just because youre stuck in a menu it is almost 2024 by now a lot of people are playing on 49 or bigger monitors start optimizing your games for larger resolution monitors if they fix this issue i will reevaluate the game and change my review accordingly

#####

this is terrible  i have a 5950x with 4090 and this game still runs at 24fps

i can run resident evil 4 and the last of us at 4k max settings above 144fps

the devs need to implement fsr or dlss into the game  this is terrible i want my money back

#####

my first 10 minutes into this game

me and my friend tried figuring out how to join eachother and play together
so i joined his lobby he picked out a job he was loading in and he could play almost straight away

me the friend who wanted to join were stuck for 5minutes when i pressed the big red button leave session it made my pc restart
i thought maybe i made a mistake but i didnt

the game doesnt want me to play it and makes my pc restart every single time when me and my friend tried playing together

i would not recommend this game

#####

all of the charm of designing a home but as a broke millennial its both affordable and dream crushing 57

#####

people are being way too harsh probably because they had to change the pricing structure when unity pulled their garbage a couple of weeks ago

performance isnt great but im on a laptop and im getting 50 to 60 fps on mediumhigh settings which is fine to me its the rendering quality that is killing it if you have problems lower that first

ive had a couple of minor bugs but thats to be expected on launch day particularly for a game that is in early access

based on reading the negative reviews the absence of a creative mode seems to be the other big sticking point not that it matters but a very similar and highly rated game house flipper also does not have creative mode my only suggestion to these people is to just play the game leveling isnt hard ive played for only a few hours and i could buy a property if i wanted to and have gone up a number of levels unlocking quite a few things personally playing the game in creative right off the bat would ruin the game for me so im not bothered by it at all

onto the good stuff the missions are quite fun i like them a lot better than house flippers missions because they allow much more player agency and creativity customers have their likes and dislikes but it doesnt prevent you from both meeting their requirements and doing your own thing in house flipper i couldnt wait to be done with the missions in this im having a blast

both decorating and building are very easy and intuitive the quick tutorial teaches you everything you need to know and despite the game being somewhat complex theres hardly any learning curve at all because of the way its designed the developers did a fantastic job of creating the games systems

overall i couldnt be happier with the game i was hesitant to buy it because i was burned out from tons of hours in house flipper but this is easily fresh enough to be its own thing im a little saddened that the user reviews are mixed the game doesnt deserve it hopefully some people will relax and have a change of heart people seem to have been expecting every possible thing they could think about to be in the game and for it to be absolutely perfect as it launched into early access its a good game already and promises to get better and better i have no problems recommending it

#####

great combination of house flipper and the sims little bit smoothing needed but overall its worth if you like building or decorating games as someone who played the sims franchise since 8 years old this is refreshing change game is in alpha so it will just become better and better i see the potential recommend

#####

the interia of all the properties is covered by a sheen  walking thro wallswhen you paint or decorate you cant see whet you do terrible gamewish i could get a refund

#####

i understand that this game is still in early access but the glitches and performance issues render it almost completely unusable i feel ripped off for spending 20 on this i really gave effort into trying to enjoy this game but it just doesnt run well most of the items in this game are almost exact copies of items found in house flipper i do not recommend this game in its current state and im hopeful they will take the reviews into consideration for the next update

#####

i tried really hard to like this game i had it on my wishlist for a long time it is just way too early access for me i played for 33 minutes had 4 crashes couldnt do multiple jobsthey just wouldnt load or would crash game you cant build from scratch even with a good computer you cant play higher than low graphic settings no search functions a lot of qol stuff missing its an okay game i see the potential but id rather just play the sims or house flipper

#####

no sandbox


#####

the game is very good but you need more things to build more furniture types and more possibilities for example more cities and its not really varied so i hope the game gets more updates and gets better because as it is at the moment it is not worth it for the price but in itself the game is good

#####

wow this game is so surprisingly relaxing digging the career mode and superintuitive building very polished for an ea been waiting for something exactly like this

#####

i love the idea i just think in its current state there isnt that much to do as for lag that people mention on my laptop i do have to play on minimum settings which makes the game not that fun and just bad to look at however on my pc im playing medium settings with no issue amd ryzen 5 5600g 160 gb ram nvidia geforce rtx 3060 youre also forced to start in the career mode which is a bummer for people who just want to build sandbox i also really hope modded content will be supported where for example you can add your own texture and fabrics i find as of now that customization is at a bare minimum and some textures are too big which causes it to not display properly on the items i really do hope with the updates the game will realize its potential

#####

was really excited for this game for a few months and never saw that sandbox mode was being taken away  kind of really disappointed with that aspect and probably wouldnt have bought it if i knew it was gone i was hoping to build whole neighborhoods but am instead locked into a job system to earn money that i can then spend on a single plot and can spend such money to buy more plots to build single houses the controls are also kind of janky in certain aspects but maybe im just used to the sims controls not being able to rotate the camera with q and e feels less intuitive but thats just me might come back to this later down the line if they bring back sandbox mode but for now this isnt for me

#####

edit
they have updated the game and made it more stable 
there are still some issues with it like limited items or needing to use duplicate items resulting in loss exp and money 
i feel there is some jobs that require ridiculous request like two kitchens or two living rooms to be built at that point just have us redo the current kitchenliving room
the organization could still be optimized via selecting specific styles we want to choose from rather than looking through all the items for example modern style
i would like to reevaluate my current assessment of 510 to 710 as they have improved alot 

im mixed on this game
it has some elements i really enjoy that i think the sims could really benefit from 
i do find items to be lacking and unorganized i like how in ts counters for example are organized by standing and wall 
i cant tell you how often i tried putting a wall shelf on the floor for a counter lol
also option to sort by style with a drop down menu 
i do like the creativity aspects of this game it seems there is almost no limit on what you can build 
for a ea game its not bad it has time to improve and grow 
i feel like workshop availability would also do nicely at some point 

for now i give it a 510 its worth playing if you like hf and ts

#####

i bought this game thinking that there was going to be a sandbox mode i was sad to find out that there is no sandbox mode and you have to work jobs to earn money to build houses of your own it was a bit misleading because there was lots of game play in sandbox mode on youtube but there is none here it is very disappointing and i hope that the developers will add  the ability to build houses with infinite resources nevertheless the game is pretty cool there is lots of furniture and you have lots of options what to build but the performance is ok  it may be that my pc is almost 2 years old but if i put on a graphic preset that is anything but low i get like 15 fps my pc runs other games fine i know its in early access still but i did pay a lot of money for this game thanks for reading all of this

#####

i would not recommend this game in this current state feels more like alpha not like a beta 


#####

its pretty fun

#####

its not perfect at the moment but has a lot of promise and is still fun make sure you check the system requirements before buying as it doesnt run on integrated graphics cards

#####

i love this game and how creative i can get with the builds there are a couple of bugs and the game definitely needs expanding but for a new game i love it and cant wait to see what they bring next

#####

if you like the sims 4 and any building games then this game is perfect for you it offers a series of levels and things to unlock while enjoying the home design part of the game play work or sandbox and enjoy all the houses you can build and design perfect for younger and older kids i love this game

#####

super fun game that looks and feels very real due to the unreal engine platform amazing performance and the career is a lot of fun the jobs are unique and satisfying to complete and you can build your own real estate portfolio and build homes from the ground up 100 recommend if you are into home design construction architecture or simulator games shoutout to the developers for an awesome experience

#####

its a great game for people who like to design houses and just build houses

#####

hometopia is a very fun and relaxing build game  i absolutely love it so far  i love that i can invite my friends and family to play online co op so we can help each other build and share our ideas  i hope the developers keep adding things to the game and making it even better  i would love to see characters added in lieu of just the head and shoulders lol but that wont stop me from playing

#####

such a cozy game with the ability to builddecorate at your own pace while listening to the background music the music it is so calm and not too repetitive  which is important for me i love that there is variation between assignments based on your interests and you dont have time limits on your work this is perfect for those times when you are just wanting to slow down and step away from things like doom scrolling 1010 would recommend

#####

#####

the game was advertised to be either career mode or freeplay mode you can only play in career mode and tbh the game isnt all that 

1  the reputation scale is the worst part no matter how much you follow the specs of the client they will just rate you 2 starts and a nasty comment about the design 
2 the client may ask for maxi items as they like clutter however you only have like 2k to do this in so how do they expect you to complete this 
3 none of the items match the kitchen cabinets sofas etc are all different so how can you design a kitchen or bathroom when every single item is different 
4 the lag is ridiculous it takes 5 minutes just to paint a wall not my cup of tea

i thought it would be like sims 4 but in career mode when infact i will be going back to sims 4 instead the developers have a lot of work to do here

#####

ok after spending about 25 hrs with this game i can cautiously recommend it  why cautiously well it is ea there are some bugs and optimization issues 

tldr  if you have close to the req system specs and play on medium settings its a fun building decorating game with lots of promise  if you have only the min specs probably not for you

i think anyone playing with the stated minimum system reqs is not going to have anything close to a good experience for reference on my system ryzen 9 5900hx rtx 3070 32ram the game plays smooth on medium settings i bumped the settings up to high for a test and while it wasnt exactly unplayable there were noticeable framerate issues medium settings look decent though

the game play itself is very promising anyone who has spent any time with sims or houseflipper should find a lot of similarities the job system really needs more in game documentationhelp  hopefully that will be added later but the actual mechanics are pretty intuitive as is the interface

im not crazy about the design choice of having to level up to access items  that would be ok except for jobs needing a certain style and you dont have access to that without leveling  not filling that req makes it harder to level up to meet that req heh you see where this is going again its ea

i think this has a ton of potential to be a very relaxing and fun building and decorating game  it still needs a bit of work but is already enjoyable

#####

fun

#####

i have very mixed emotions about the game by all means i can see myself still playing this daily i have been waiting for this game since 2021 announcement not fully disappointed but it is lacking 

i love the idea of the game its very thought out with the level up rewards it makes it very satisfying customisation was very thought out except i am still confused how to make a paint just the front door white without painting the handle too but even playing 20 hours of the game i havent seen much of it the customers are very picky i honestly have had maybe a select few 5 star ratings no game is that picky with designing even doing a basic design for penny pinchers you get a bad review it really downgrades your self esteem because you think you did an amazing job hitting all their needs and wants even what they did and did not ask for but you get one star rating or fail thats really my only con of the game alongside the graphics settings even with gaming pcs not working properly other than the obvious add more designs and things to the game and more customisation options looking forward to updates and more content

#####

game is badly optimized even for good graphic card would wait before buying

#####

poorly optimized
no sandbox mode
lazy and boring campaign
very slow progression
feels like a game for your phone

refunded

#####

i just bought the game and is crashing all the time i cant play at all 

#####

needs work it has promise though no key binding no snapping no grid camera is not smooth no undo button honestly its very clear this is early access my game already crashed once i like that you can add to an existing house to make it bigger i like that you can play with friends i like that you can assign a layout before building i like that all the swatches are customizable it has potential but it is far from ready for release and im growing pretty tired of all of these companies offering early access games that are just too early to justify paying for it its really unfortunate they lose player confidence and kill a game before it even has the possibility to gain traction

#####

the developer hometopia inc is 100 hosting this game on a 20 year old desktop running windows vista my desktop is a powerhouse and can play every title on ultra settings but somehow i need to drop this potato of a game down to the lowest settings for it to run its unplayable with the volume of crashes bugs and performance issues please save your money this was a total cash grab

#####

better than the sims and the tenants

#####

i have had this game sat in my wishlist for 2 years nearly was really look forward to playing it but unfortunately it has been quite a disappointment im an avid sims player and have been for the past 10 years however at the moment i do not personally find that hometopia passes sims in being the best home building game 

pros 
 lots of choice in different furnishing styles
 can freely customise furniture however there is also a con to this which ill get to 
 game graphics are good 
 ive not found many bugs for an early access release like others are reporting
 devs are really interactive and want the constructive feedback makes it feel more of a community 

cons 
 need to make it so it doesnt customise the whole object such as door handles cupboard handles etc 
 need to make kitchen sinks separate to cabinets make full sets and make cabinets align properly also need corner cabinets from the start 
 career mode is repetitive and after nearly 5 hours of playtime im honestly bored 
 sandbox mode is a must i have mainly bought this game so i can design houses how i want not how others want me to 
 the client expectations are literally the same dialogue for each job i like a cozy feel i dont want to spend more than i need to which leads me back to the repetitive nature of the career mode
 this is more annoying than anything else but when you click on an object you cant then click off it without exiting the full menu 

overall the game has potential but developers really need to take the feedback being provided and update the game sooner rather than later i would really love to love this game but in its current state i unfortunately dont 



#####

i was really hyped and looking forward for this game but then i was ore than dissapointed
first of all the performance no matter what i tried and i tried a lot using the forums and reddit  fps was dropping all the time textures were not rendering well
the game was unplayable for me at 5 to 10 fps

my specs are not bad since i got a gtx2060 32 gb of ram and a ryzen 7 i installed the game on my ssd but obviously that didnt helped 

i refunded the game  maybe ill ive it a try next year

#####

this game good for play together with friends but this game always lag n crash only 2 person inside the server but ermmm and the furniture very boring furniture not pair example cabinet kitchen got 2 only can put and other cabinet its not suitable hope after early access hometopia be upgrade all and the colour also

#####

i really dont like the wall painted textures it looks like it has streaks all the timeit should be a smooth flat colourtheres very few kitchen counters and cupboardshas some potential but is missing alot that other games such as house flipper and sims hasoptions

#####

this game is so much fun there are a few small bugs but once it is out of early access i bet it will be amazing

#####

poorly optimized

#####

very disappointing  i asked a week ago so i know youre working on figuring it out but since im kind of naive when it comes to system reqirements do either or both of us meet them they responded so yes and no  the problem with the system requirements is people are able to run a game under the minimum requirements with no problems on ultra and some newer computers are having issues  its a matter of the shaders  the problem may not be related to your computer at all  three days later they posted this httpsdiscordcomchannels6043801091091988508591673338333757651158469247454945300   apparently they dont believe in honesty or clear messaging ive refunded and feel bad for everyone else who wasted their time and money

#####

i dont know that is this games still on an early development or not   i love the ideas of this games but i think the developer should focus on helping the choices in the games play much more easier  for example the control panel on object is still confusing and when building a wall it should create a whole room not just create by building a single wall and  the rotation of the games camera is buggy and lacking on high setting even my pc can play other games in high graphic setting for many hours without lagging  thanks 

#####

gud

#####

very relaxing game

#####

what i like  the ability to move up levels different scenarios that push your creative abilities
what i dont like  the necessity to rely on my keyboard to move around the lots  
i do recommend this game however if you are coming from a game like the sims  do not think it will be remotely the same  this game challenge you and awards you if you follow the prompts of the homeowner  and penalizes you if you do not

#####

i love this game so much i keep seeing all bad reviews but this game is still in early access and it still needs some things to work on definitely but its really fun so far people are saying it is laggy but i have had no lag issuses so far its a game i highly recommend even if you wanna play it now when it is still in development or when its finished and it runs smoother 

i have been playing it with one of my friends and it is really fun even though it has some bugs and we dont read the likes and dislikes correctly we still have a lot of fun even when our reputation goes down 

i love games like this and i am happy i get to do early access for this game

#####

there is nothing really original about this game just a poor designed version of house flipper early access is not alpha 4 years in development and thats the best you can do copy every idea from an another game waste of money to bad it sounded really promissing

#####

i would love to tell you what i like about hometopia if i could actually play it 

#####

sims but only the good stuff

#####

i never made a real review for a game but now i need to because its a game that caught my attention first of all i was sceptic buying this game before i saw the reviews but when i entered the game it was completely something else yeah it doesnt have the sandbox mode yet but the reviews about the performances of the game is something that you are very stupid if you look carefully you can go and uncheck the vsync and your fps cap will be alright im running the game in ultra and i only have a decent pc rtx 3060 and i7 9700 32gb ram yeah i debrief that you all are ragers and people who are hesitating buying the game dont i promise its worth it

#####

fun game kind of reminds me of house flipper but different as well  lots of options to decorate add on to buildings try to please your clients lol  i did not have any crashing issues freezing issues or anything  runs smooth and just fine for me and i have played 123 hours to date

#####

house


#####

jai toujours rêvé de concevoir et de construire ma maison idéale et maintenant grâce à cet incroyable jeu de simulation de construction de maison sur steam je peux transformer ce rêve en réalité directement depuis mon écran dordinateur  laissezmoi vous dire que ce jeu est un véritable joyau et je ne men lasse pas

dès le moment où jai lancé le jeu jai été époustouflé par les graphismes époustouflants et lattention portée aux détails le niveau de réalisme de cette simulation est vraiment impressionnant chaque brique carrelage et meuble semble incroyablement réaliste ce qui rend lensemble du processus de construction immersif et satisfaisant

#####

i love this game

#####

this is really good game and i think people should try at least once in their lifetime it allows people to build their creation and walk around in their dream home of course theres a few things i would like to see in the game like more stuff that you can put in like solar panels and wind turbines it would be interesting to see so keep it the good work you guys and ill make sure i continue playing see what you guys come up with next if one of the creators are currently watching this please put achievements in the game

#####

meh

#####

installed played the tutorial found it didnt have good widescreen support and that i was getting 2030 fps on lowmedium settings with a 2080ti refunded this is a bit too early access for my liking hopefully it improves will pick it up later when they sort out some issues and add a ui slider

#####

dog shiet it crashes so many times

#####

not fun very frustrating

#####

graphics are absolutely horrible

#####

house flipper but for people who are actually creative jamiesonfuddrucker on tiktok approves

#####

good game i love it is easy

#####

lots of mixed or negative comments around here that are flatly wrong

you can snap things together  just hold down alt while you move them near one another ive got lines and lines of unbroken cabinetry there are bugs in some other things like a sectional that doesnt line up no matter what i do

im on high end hardware  64gb ram 3080ti ryzen 7 3700x ive experienced no lags no stutters and no issues at max graphic settingsunless i leave the game logged in over night there may be some memory leakage occurring when the game is open for hours and hours doing nothing

there is no sandbox yet and i too am looking forward to it but the jobs you can do for clients right now are great training for when i can build fallingwater in a hometopia sandbox its early access some things are not running perfectly but ill be playing this for years and cant wait for more items and options

#####

i always dreamed of being an interior designer and with hometopia i can finally be one at least virtually i love how simple the gameplay is and the graphics look amazing

#####

im going to go against the grain here the game isnt that bad yes it needs polish but it does say early access it is not unplayable supporting it now will ensure steady updates and content 

you should try it out its not for everyone but i think its a great deal of fun

#####

the best game dont look at older reviews because glich is now fixed

#####

just about everything

#####

bugs and other issues

#####

sandbox mode should really be available at the start

#####

i have a rtx 4090 decided to max my graphics only the most minuscule things changed when i maxed them out and i went from 90fps to 30 this game needs serious work before it should be bought let alone for 20 dollars

#####

now that house flippers 2 is out this game has absolutely no appeal  boring

#####

would not recommend

#####

game is extremely glitchy

#####

bro why coop crashed

#####

oh boy how nice are the devs to let as play a so called chilled game made up with gameplay from 30 years ago graphics from 20 years ago and optimization carried out by a bunch of 5yearolds just dropped out from kindergarten great job boys and girls and retarded human excrement  should i give you all a prize since everybody is a winner
frankly the only ones that are chilled are those behind the front desk counting their dollars before everyone issues a refound enjoying champagne and caviar on a fly to some tinpot little european country and dumping our money to a giant laundry machine you think they know how games work they dont even know how human should work after all theres no evidence showing that people have ever actually built the game come to think about it the game is just as well built as the shitty ass base and stage 4 cancer walls and midage balding roof that they showed us during the tutorial
if you have a fresh new alex hamilton to buy this game dont get yourself a cup of proper cappuccino or just find your nearest slot machine and pull the rod you might actually get something

#####

good

#####

there are tons of glitches but what pissed me off the most is finishing a job and getting kicked out of the game right before completion and get 0 that is zero money to build on my land that i bought im steaming i am so mad

#####

hometopia is so fun i love house flipper type games and im a sims builder so this is definitely my cup of tea i love that you can build and decorate from the ground up or take it story mode and just flip houses for cash the very best part is that its multiplayer ive never had a decoratingbuilding game that i could play with friends and now i do wishlist this game please

#####

good game

#####

big yes

#####

i really enjoy this game so many cool items to build with and almost everything is customizable  very smart interface for building and excellent graphics if you enjoying building in the sims then you just may enjoy this game better

#####

once the devs figures out had to add corners to the roof and adds slightly smaller doors so my 1 tile wide wall can fit a door i say this game will be pretty damn good especially if you just wanna lay back and build a house

#####

its equally fun as well as challenging the further you get into the game ive enjoyed it thus far and see myself playing it for a while

#####

is fun easy to use and fun

#####

very unpolished  controls seem completely counter intuitive and no way to change them  glad it wasnt expensive but the sales team nailed it  im sure if i spent more time on it which i will i will understand controls better but it really is counter intuitive in the movements of the mouse  building is a nightmare with no snap to grid feature that can be turned off and on  maybe it will get better but so far its not nearly as free form as i thought it would be even with sandbox mode  my final score of hometopia is a very optimistic meh

#####

absolutely gorgeous game its so wonderful building houses and such little bugs and glitches but ive seen that they fix them pretty fast if youre curious just get it its worth it on sale or not

#####

i really love this game iv been waiting years for this kind of game and i can tell you that if my mom and grandfather were still alive they would love this game for  me i would give it a a

#####

yes this is a great game  it has a good progression lots of items easy to use and several modes including a free build
playlist of gameplay

#####

i have been in contracting for about 9 years now i find myself always looking for games i can design my own home with and build well the home of my dreams they have completely nailed it here the graphics game play and the ability to do what you want has allowed this game to become a hit if your looking into building your dreams this game is a must cant wait for them to add more items to place in the home and maybe allow better deck building options but i give it 48 stars good job guys

#####

this game does has a lot of potentials

#####

not playable the resolution of the game wont sync with my screen resolution 2560 x 1440 even though that is an option in the game ive tried every setting there is  to get them to match this means you cant access all the items to purchase furniture and decor or pick paint colors because they just wont show up im going to ask for my money back

#####

its still barebones but it has got some amazing potencial cant wait to build my real life dream house in it and use the game to brainstorm ideas for some home improvement

#####

i absolutely love this game as an avid player of house flipper this game brought so many ideas and mechanics i wish had been in house flipper and after looking at their updates planned for the next few years im even more excited to play

#####

hometopia is a great game its super relaxing and fun to play

#####

i lov game

#####

only played sandbox so far but so so fun working on a house in mountains _

#####

one of the most enjoyable homebuilders on the market
there a few minor inconveniences that can take some getting used to but the dev team work tirelessly on fixes


#####

love it the customization of this game is one of a kind cannot tell you how many hours ive spent throughout many nights creating homes i wish i lived in i never get tired of it sandbox mode was a game changer cant wait for the progression of this game for the future

#####

the game has so much potential i am addicted  to it even with the stubbornness of the bugs when you get to the guest house mission youll understand i cannot wait till i can play this above low quality

#####

its an awesome game also passes time and is overall calming
its definitely worth the 20

#####

i am enjoying the game was waiting for sandbox mode to come out and im happy they released it they are making big updates and the optimization is alot better im looking forward to the future updates especially communities even though it will be a while love the customization and multiplayer building in sandbox havent tried multiplayer in career mode but will try that next

#####

hometopia is an absolute gem of a game for anyone who loves designing and decorating houses the creativity it allows is truly impressive the game offers a delightful experience letting you unleash your imagination and bring your dream homes to life the similarity with sims adds an extra layer of enjoyment making it feel familiar yet uniquely refreshing the userfriendly interface and the abundance of customization options make hometopia an engaging and satisfying gameplay im thoroughly enjoying my time with it and i highly recommend it to fellow design enthusiasts

#####

caution to the consumer snapping is off many objects do not snap close enough to the wall especially kitchen cabinets its very poorly optimized there is not many objects to choose from even with everything unlocked lighting is weird and gives things a weird shimmer changing the color of objects does not work correctly frame rate is bad career mode is half baked very limited pattern options for wood and fabric not worth a purchase in its current state as it is very bare bones and does not offer much

#####

if youre looking for a complete and polished game this is not for you however if you dont mind supporting a developer and being along for the ride then i recommend this game though i do have a few complaints

there is no symmetrical snapping when i want to place a few windows i have to try to angle them perfectly which is repetitive and frustrating if theres and option for this i am not aware

when you add things life roofing there should be a paint bucket option or something of the sort so i dont have to place tiles one by one or click and drag too fill in each square

the game looks great but isnt optimized very well i have a pretty good pc but unfortunately i have to turn down the games beautiful graphics to be able to run on a decent frame rate 

despite all this i believe this game has lots of potential ive always wanted a sims style house building game without all the sims 

this game is a solid 610 for me and even just a few quality of life updates would raise this rating

#####

super fun game i definitely recommend it to people who like designing houses the graphics are amazing and the gameplay is superb

#####

great game but if im in sand box mode if i try to fill in an area about 25 square meters or bigger the game lags really badly and if i try a massive area like 750 square meters the game just crashes idk if thats just my pc or a game bug

#####

love the customisation

#####

ทำไมเสยเงนซอเกมสแลวตองมานงเกบเงนเพอสรางบานของตวเองอกทนง  where is the sandbox mode  maybe you should add cheatcode into this game

#####

try this game for yourself before reading all the reviews i was skeptical at first but was hopeful as it is a kick starter and they have provided a clear timeline of upgrades in development boyi am so glad i purchased this game it is an incredible house building and renovation game with having a multiplayer option as a plus
the only glitch thus far was that some of the tabletop accessories may not sit exact on top of tables but that is super minimal and didnt stop me hours of game play i love how you can gain levels and really get creative in trying to meet the clients desires in a home you really have to pay action to the details in getting a perfect score i also really like how many different property locations there are in finding the best spot in building your first home just make sure your pc has the optimum graphics support and hometopia plays super smooth with no lag cant say it enough on how much i am enjoying this game and excited to see what all they add on along the way keep up the great work developers 

#####

bought the game feeling excited for this sim like game game wouldnt even load immediately crashed when i tried to play it  so i bought it without knowing it is 100 unplayable

#####

i love the whole game i love to build and add decor to the houses i love being able to do 1st person or sky view

#####

i would totally recommend this game mulitplayer was so fun we both got hooked into it all the little details  decorations we can add and customize really awesome game

#####

the graphics are pretty intense for a laptop but my laptop runs it ok im really looking forward to improvements and additions along the way well spent money for me there are so many items already and im only 3 hours into the game i have so much yet to explore and things to add to houses its crazy and the quality is very well done i can tell the devs love housing as much as we all do

#####

hometopia is freaking awesome and i can totally see myself sinking hundreds of hours into it the future for this game is bright and theres so much stuff that can be added with updates dlcs and community created content 
the game currently suffers from optimization issues that im sure will be fixed in future patches sandbox mode isnt available just yet but ill edit my review once its out theres also an annoying bug with mirrors which makes them look pretty odd like portals to another dimensions but overall im pretty satisfied so far and i cant wait for more content to show up 1010 would recommend

#####

two points to the devs for allowing arrow keys for movement this game has good graphics and runs well the jobs arent really too hard i struggle on how to furnish my little starter home but hope it will go well when i unlock more items i have other similar games which i still prefer over this one though

#####

very good for big buinesses that are for interior designing

#####

good game a bit buggy they need an update

#####

great concept but not ready for ea or release game is far too buggy to enjoy assigning areas for rooms is very tedious and every so often causes a glitch where a single block in a room will assign itself to its own room multiplayer will be great but the game is in no stable state to support it without any issue freezing while building foundations freezing when placing walls and sometimes not allowing you to place walls in a number of instances there will be a single tile that needs covering to finish a job even though all tiles are covered very poor experience with this game i just hope they update it and address all the issues

#####

cant wait till the sandbox mode is here so far i love the game

#####

my experience is that the game is unplayable i get that it is early but i was not impressed i much prefer house flipper and should have spent my money on it i feel like my money was wasted it froze lagged screen jerked etc changed quality the game kept changing it back once it froze for good by the time i got my laptop back on and steam open they denied my refund request steams inconvenient for everyone but them refund policy is terrible ive gotten 30 mins of game play out of the 34 steam says ive played at this point as soon as i launch it just starts freezing if you plan to get this game id wait a bit my laptop isnt a bad one and ive seen people with much better ones not be able to play the game

#####

i love the game however in renovation mode when you delete something you get that money back when you build on a lot you bought and delete something you do not get that money back so if you build on a lot after level 7 you can not delete it and start over because you dont get that money back you will have to start on new job in order to get that money back

#####

its and awesome game

#####

detailed and engaging game with lots of options for customization and design my only complaint is that the snapping tools are finicky and sometimes do not cooperate

edited to add this game gives me serious headaches and i mean actual headaches im not sure what it is about the graphics but it hurts my head and i cant play for more than an hour or so before i have to quit

#####

love the game just a little glitchy and runs kind of slow but its such a great experience


#####

aside from a very few little glitches i love this game i played sim city sims 2 3 and 4  3 and 4 on pc and ps3 and ps4 i have played house flipper on ps4 and pc and hometopia is now my favourite there are things that can and im sure will be improved upon given enough time its a robust earlyaccess game and im looking forward to spending many more hours designing my own places thanks

#####

if you like the building custom places on games like the sims or house flipper this game is definitely for you but even with this being early access this game is already leaps and bounds ahead still some bugs but as to be expected im very excited to see where this game goes

#####

really cool graphics and can see alot of good things for this game in the future cant wait for all the updates

#####

overall im excited to see where this game can go with that said theres a lot of quality of life issues that need fixing if i want to dump much more time into this game optimization also needs a lot of work but being in early access that is to be expected

pros
the leveling system is great and gives you motivation to take the jobs and unlock more items i cant wait to see what items come out in the future
once you understand how the work orders work it is easy to give the client what they are asking for
i like being able to start out with your own house to renovate without any restrictions from the clients
the game has huge potential 

cons
some items cannot be customized all the way just pieces of them there is nothing more annoying to me in this game than getting a whole room furnished going to customize all the furniture to match only to find out you can only change one part of the item ie certain bedroom end tables you can only change the outside wood and not the drawer and it just looks cheesy
kitchen items are a pain there is some items that dont even have matching other items so there is some cabinets that i would like to use and cant because it doesnt have other furniture that fits with it this would be fine in some cases if they were all compatible with the gas range to make a stove on a regular counter but there is some counters that cant place that item on for some reason on the topic of kitchen items you cant snap them so its a struggle trying to align them and most of the time they just end up clipping
the hit box for some items is ridiculously off trying to place decor on some shelves is annoying or impossible because the game acts like you are trying to put it in the next room or the ceiling
next one is more of an annoyance than it is game breaking but when youre in the furniture catalog if you click one to see what it looks like but decide against it and try to choose another it closes out the whole catalog for you to have to open again
i wish there was a way to buy houses to renovate instead of only being able to buy empty plots to build from the ground up that is definitely great and everything but sometimes id like to be able to just renovate a whole house without having to build it

overall i do suggest this game if youre okay with some glitches the game itself could be great it just needs a lot of polish if youre not okay with riding out the glitches as they get fixed i would definitely say to wait because there is quite a few at this time

#####

w gameee

#####

when this game came up on my feed i was so excited i went to youtube to watch gameplay was blown away that i could create homes from scratchsomething i loved doing as a kid with lego i didnt read the  steam reviews something i usually always do sandbox stood outeven the store page says players can create their own homes on blocks but alas seems not yet there must have been a full fledged game demo a year ago from what i can see that demo allowed you to build any homefor now i will keep the game hoping it will be put back

edit yay not long after my review breaking news from the devs sandbox mode coming november 7thcant wait woohoo

#####

i would suggest to add more furniture for a big variety of options

#####

its like house flipper but more cool in graphics

#####

really fun relaxing game obviously a little buggy at time with it being in a pre release state but worth playing with a friend or so 

#####

all the best parts of the sims build to your hearts content create homes and renos for others and earn enough to build a dream home where you make the rules i love the challenges it gives me and im excited for more content to come

#####

this game is so addictive i love this game

#####

the only thing i do not like is how slow the game is i tried changing the settings and it made it worse but the lagg is bad and controling paning in and out of the homes is very slow too much lagg

#####

plenty of flaws most obviously not being able to sell your homes or at least a sandbox mode so you can build the home you want  there are still bugs and crashes along the way but hardly game breaking in my experience aside from this it is extremely addictive to the point of needing a meeting can only hope the development continues as this really is a potentially brilliant gameprogramme

#####

very good all that is missing is the sandbox keep it up 

#####

fun game some bugs as to be expected of early access but overall very enjoyable for people wanting a sims building experience without the need to work forever very exited for sandbox and future updates

#####

ive been waiting for this game to drop for years and i am not disappointed some bugs need to be worked out and some optimization needs to occur however its a pretty fun little game as it is now i cant wait to see where it goes from here

#####

the devs are continuously squashing bugs but overall i love to design and build to my hearts desire still waiting for sandbox mode but i am happy with the game place i am also really hoping for mods to become available

#####

nice change of pace from the fpss i play mostly the structured campaign is a great way to ease into the genre and am looking forward to a sandbox mode the movement is fluid and actions are satisfying highly recommend

#####

the game is really fun i would buy it again anytime since ive been playing it i cant stop thinking that i could paint some walls in real life too still has a few bugs and needs some reworking but so far i havent found any critical points what is definitely missing is a sandbox mode instead the controls are quite well thought out and the game is thus also very childfriendly

but  its not the game i was expecting i expected more cadlike functionality for example the creation of foundations to the centimeter not just squares of 1x1 meter as well as the input of the thickness of walls and the import of own blocks in common cad formats i think this game would have such a very high potential to be used for visualizing simple construction projects in real life as well however it needs some improvements for that

and a little hint to the developers if plants grow through walls you should probably not renovate the house but demolish it  

#####

has some performance issues at time of review but it is being actively developed and is in early access overall a pretty good building sim with a lot of options for people who enjoy staging design and home layout

#####

this game is like house flipper but easier to navigate and multiplayer i love it there are a few bugs but it is early access so that is only to be expected this just might be one of my new favourite games

#####

a chill  cozy home building game for me its really satisfying to paint the walls and place the floor tiles
performance is definitely an issue running on high end machine but other than that i can recommend to people who loves the building part of sims

#####

as early access its great but needs more guidance and camera control improvements for instance the job wont accept that all roof tiles are complete even though they are and traits of clients are penny pinchers and not fussed with quality so i add medium quality and low budget items and then get deducted money and rating for doing so also id like to see grind free own home building i have high hopes for game improvement so still recommend it

#####

really fun to play and i havent had any problems with crashing or lag

#####

for an early access this game is pretty fleshed out  thanks caryn and connie for the recommendation

#####

updated review i went back and tried this game again since another builder game i play seems to forget what made it great and its starting to grow on me a lot of the issues i had with the game has been worked out and sandbox mode is fun sometimes i had to site back and be like i need 100 more windows on a tiny wall fun and this game has come a long way i cant wait to see what more is coming for this game and yes i said i would tell people to pass on this game but now after going back and replaying it ive been telling people to give it a chance itll grow on you pretty quickly 



#####

really fun with friends i just hope the devs fix the bugs

#####

i played the demo and it was good i like this game but there still a lot is missing

#####

the ui is very oldschool and honestly ugly the furniture is not worth to even put in houses its very laggy and kinda unplayable

#####

massive potential i havent played that much yet i can tell if the developers keep updating this game it will become one of the greatest home building games i gifted this to my wife since she loves building homes in sims we have not tried coop yet the positive the amount of stuff you can unlock use build and modify is crazy i absolutely love that you can build your house in sims like bird view but switch to first person to inspect it and place things 

biggest negative so far is the optimization its bad this could be one of the most beautiful home building games but i should not have to put the quality settings to medium when i can play literally any other game on ultra settings without fps issues or lag so what do i think the devs should work on right away optimization please fix that asap

#####

i just want to build houses always was only interested in the getting land and building the homes and neighborhoods with friends i dont want to play a game where i have to sweep up crap before i can design it but bc of a bug i cant see where the mess is so i cant move on i know it is early access but the change where you have to level up to level 7 to buy land is super annoying and who knows if i got there if it really would be what they used to say it was going to be im slow never play games and im hours in and i think im over it so sad waited 2 years for them to finally come out with this and it is stupid

#####

with the understanding that this is in early access and there are going to be bugs hiccups and performance issues the foundation is here for a really good game even with the current limitations i havent had this much fun building and decorating houses since the sims 23

#####

i just wanted to thank the devs personally this truly is one of the greatest home builders ive ever played youve absolutely demolished this genre of game a new standard is being set and i couldnt be happier i saw a video for this game 2 years ago and have been excited for this since 

while yes it does have its hiccups it doesnt compare to the great content you have in this game i dont care to play at 2030fps at launch its not a fps i grew up on sims 1  2 this lag isnt nothing like it can be i dont care about the customers review bombing me  which you fixed   this is just the beginning you guys have delivered a crazy solid product im glad to be a part of the beginning

edit with continued updates the game is running smoother and qol updates are rolling in sandbox mode has been added get this game already

#####

i am a big fan of this games concept and will wait a bit for development before playing again  the controls rn feel a bit clunky for me

my suggestionsquestions
 when you hover over an item in the item selection screen it should show a larger image  the thumbnails are very small on their own
 is there a demolish everything on lot option for owned lots
 the cleaning up  removing trash part feels a bit unnecessary  i know its more realistic but this is a game lol
 what does all remaining furniture styles mean when no specific styles have been mentioned 

havent tried coop yet

#####

the best house building game ive ever played

#####

game is buggy speically in muilt player mode

#####

great concept but not enjoyable at the moment and runs terrible freezes and crashes 
everything works a bit finnicky very hard to place things together like cabinets and if you use the grid they all stick through the walls 
i have to run it on lowest settings on my 1080ti and still only get about 40 fps meanwhile it uses 100 of my graphics card

#####

this game is an advanced version of the home design software that i bought in 1998 



#####

game freezes every time i try and load a job very buggy maybe purchase again at a later date when not in early access as the aspect of the game is good

#####

furniture doesnt line up to the grid lines so cabinets ect all have a small gap between them it was enough to refund

#####

just gave hometopia a try and im pretty impressed the customization options are solid and ive enjoyed setting up different spaces graphics are good and the career mode adds a nice touch worth checking out if youre into design

#####

this game is a fantastic concept and i commend the game creators for what is a great idea for casual gamers who like cosy games and build games 

my major concern is with the gameplay the game recommends that you run it on lowest graphics if it is running slowly but even with the lowest graphics possible the lag is just unbearable and makes gameplay impossible 

its disappointing to see this as the game is great otherwise hopefully they resolve some of the gameplay issues in future
