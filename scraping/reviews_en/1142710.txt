as a preface i like the core gamebut

so what did creative assembly do this time

they have increased the amount of cut content in their games for which they profusely apologized and then did not make up for make no mistake they fully intend to try this again as proven by years of experience total war three kingdowms and total war rome 2

people here often forget the dual nature of the main current sticking point they have decreased the content amount for dlcs and raised their prices simultaneously they are claiming rising prices no specifics just vague pointing towards economy inflation or something i dunno

they have issued a veiled threat to players essentially alluding to the discontinuation of the games development if we do not meet their sales quota as if we are their employees that have to take it from them they also managed to slip in a dangling carrot in front of the more easily manipulable players citing all the wonderful content they have planned if only we would gobble up their products without question

here is the direct quote from them

this is the business reality of supporting warhammer iii and ensuring were able to offer the years of extra content that are currently planned


so can we back up their claims of increasing prices

no not really ca basically employs a lot of dirty tricks meant to maximize profits the issue with this incredibly tired disproven shortsighted thinking is that it simply doesnt work and it never has

but to expand upon my point here are some circumstances to consider

ca has numerous critiques on glassdoor about the low salary compared to other players in the industry

they put a third party antitamper solution into their game called denuvo this drm technology has a proven track record of slowing games down by increasing the millisecond time for frame generation as well as decreasing the fps of games sometimes even by 30 percent a game like tw 3 which already has a pretty steep system requriement this is an uncalled for also ca could have taken the money and give it to developers instead of denuvo clicking the end turn button should not be dreaded

ca a studio founded in 1987 employing 882 people as per wikipedia and being bought by sega in 2005 received a 5 million gbp grant from the uk government that is meant for startup companies 

their parent company sega also keeps receiving the vgtr the video games tax relief 20 million gbp per year that they have then used to wipe out the corporation tax bill of ca entirely since 2014

also jsut to see what companies we are talking about here are their revenues
sega revenue 2022 314 billion usd
creative assembly revenue 2021 62 million usd

ca sold over 22 million copies in the total war series by 2018 according to sega themselves after twwh 1 and 2 i invite you to extrapolate from partial information where they may stand now

wholesale workstation and hardware prices have gone down after the postpandemic chip shortage is over

1st edit as requested by dance commander ca actually tried to put the red shell advertisement program into their launcher while the original public optics all stated that red shell is simply an advertisement tool it later turned out to be the textbook definition of a spyware software here is an excerpt from the 2018 polygoncom expose

begin quote  the spyware sells itself as a means for video game makers to uncover where their players come from through reliable attribution it matches whether players with red shell installed on their games visited a markets campaign whether facebook and twitter youtube a web page or others

to do this red shell has to follow what users are doing outside of the game but the company said it does not collect any players personal information and only collects information about their browsers and devices for purposes of attribution   end quote

on a personal note i would like to point out that red shell
never actually disclosed what datadatapoints they are collecting
when requested for this disclosure they did not do it in direct violation of gdpr
red shell never asks you for your consent to run and you cannot opt out
red shell runs even when the game doesnt 
several ad blockers doesnt even let you go to their webpage without first being warned of its contents

ca after the public outrage decided to remove it from their launcher but they did try it dont forget that end of 1st edit

2nd edit by me after reading comments i would like to address some of them here i wont just fling the shill tag around as it is reductive and doesnt advance the conversation

dudeget a life these games cost a lot 
formulating a critical opinion about something someone cares about is considered a bad thing just because it costs a lot of money to make that is not a healthy mindset by this logic i should just worship the makers of star citizen becuase they managed to sink a countrys gdp into their halfbaked shambling horror also 2006 called they want their insults back

what a great review that says basically nothing about the game it is purportedly a review of
a game review doesnt only have to be about the end product only sometimes some events may require a peek at the workshop where it is made in or just warn other potential buyers about the full scope of a situation around a game making sure others are more informed before making a purchase is what this community is supposed to be about i wont apologize for that

denuvo does not effect ssds
indeed you are correct i did not do proper due diligence and check the date on several analyses i have based my statement on denuvo has since transformed their modus operandi and altered their process from excessive io operations to certain custom eventbased triggers deleted that section thank you for noticing end of 2nd edit

in conclusion

dear creative assembly and the two gentlemen who wrote that explanationapology on the total war blog game development is a service industry in the end of the day if you bring a good product people will buy it without questioning it furthermore they will keep buying it for the foreseeable future as there is no stronger marketing tool in the walrd than wordofmouth that is of course unless the quality drops your studio will not be the first to experience what it is like to reach the point where people will just not care about your product enough

furthermore even if you start shipping good content again at reasonable prices the stink of your decisions will taint that as well

please do not fall into this downward spiral it is getting very boring and i feel like i am jeff goldblum from jurassic park counting on his fingers
company makes good product
company expands upon good product
noncreatives start dictating how to make product more profitable
noncreatives start bringing out charts and the book of drity tricks
product suffers
more noncreatives are brought in to remedy a creativitydriven problem
parent company has enough
parent company demands more money
noncreatives bust out the codex of dirty tricks
product dies and no one at the helm knows why

i leave it to everyones discretion where ca stands in this process

ps on a more cynical note
ca pull yourself together cut out the people making these decisions pay your valuable employees from the freed up money and return to formula to flourish again also please remove denuvo it is just a burden give that money to your developers instead

the right to discuss is a privilegeit is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game  cas pr department

unfortunately i lack the proper free speechtm dlc to post an accurate review of this game

#####

before i start ranting i want to say that i wouldnt have posted any review definitely not a negative one before creative assemblys recent statement

lord packs for warhammer i  699

lord packs for warhammer ii  799

lord packs for warhammer iii  1999

race packs for warhammer i and ii  1499

race packs for warhammer iii  1999

creative assembly released a statement yesterday 17th august to the effect of were raising our dlc prices because of inflation and if you dont buy it we will cut support even for already planned dlc whats the rate of inflation again how many millions did ca turnover in the last year alone 

ive bought every single dlc for all three games up to now as many on discount as possible as well as all three base games on discount but started to get sceptical with the champions of chaos release especially after the state that game three released in it was literally unplayable for me and many others at the time how did it pass qa at that point anyway after some deliberating i decided that champions of chaos was fair value four legendary lords and a bunch of new chaos units i like warriors of chaos alot so i thought it was one of the better dlcs chaos dwarves was right on the edge of the boundary of pricing for me but i enjoyed it and got a fair amount of hours from it i decided this upcoming dlc is just too far 1999 retail for a lord pack is crazy

add to this the fact that we dont get quality of life updates such as bug fixes unless theyre released along side a paid dlc is just sad it has been three months 25th may since we last had a major patch after the release of that patch nakai could no longer recruit kroxigors modders in the community fixed that almost immediately but ca decided fixing a bug as significant as this especially for a paid dlc character was not worth the time until the next upcoming patch about three months later down the line

ca are wasting the potential for this gameseries for the sake of trying to increase short term profits i dont know if they can ride this out for the next two weeks until shadows of change releases as theyre obviously under immense pressure with their current stance i think they should be very worried not just about shadows of change but also pharaoh and hyenas although alot can happen in the coming weeks or months

whilst im here and this is minor compared to the other problems they never added back in the chaos undivided soundtrack that was in both game one and two of course community modders did though on youtube chaos undivided  dynamic total war warhammer soundtrack if you dont know what song im referring to imagine your favourite faction without their soundtrack a detail some people might not care about but i think it shows cas lack of attention to some of the aspects that made this series so good

something that i absolutely hate about this game are the sieges towers on the walls that only shoot outside of the settlement fine it makes sense towers lining the inside of settlements with 360 degree angle of fire unlimited ammunition and if they are destroyed then they can be rebuilt it is probably the one aspect of the game itself that i hate

for now i will leave this review as it is hopefully something gives the community for this game would be much happier if the pricing model for dlc was more sensible and didnt feel like we were being kicked in the balls regular updates with quality of life improvements and bug fixes not only alongside paid dlc would be very much appreciated but i dont expect ca to do this

people can do whatever they want with their own money but for now i want to suggest people hold off giving more money to creative assembly just to see if their attitude towards their consumer base changes to a more positive tone

if you want to add a comment to this review then feel free

update 1st september 

i appreciate the comments and everyone who took the time to read my and others reviews 

after two weeks since leaving my initial review there still has been no communication from ca about the backlash from the community apart from their default marketing campaign they obviously went all in as i write this the new dlc has already dropped out of the top 10 after being there very briefly and is now sitting around 16th for anyone who doesnt know the top 10 is based off of revenue generated not amount of units sold it was always going to get fairly high due to the excessively high price but to see it already starting to fall is no surprise as not so many people are buying it i would imagine they now wont sell many more units of this dlc

as for the new patch with the improved ai well i started a campaign as khazrak and it is a steam roll in battles the ai will have most of their 20 stack prioritise warhounds that will kite them around the entire map the ai has been pretty bad for a long time now but this is the worst and most easily manipulated i have ever seen it they have made this game way too easy i shouldnt be happy to be surrounded by enemies knowing that i can easily farm them all and will not lose a battle let alone the campaign

cas behaviour has convinced me to not only not buy this dlc but also to not buy pharaoh maybe the next dlc will be regular price but for now this review stays indefinitely negative my suggestions are fix bugs regularly atleast once a month every two weeks could be ideal balance passes take care of the details like units being in the wrong rosters soundtracks missing woc beastmen norsca etc 

finally adjust your dlc model silence and the fury shadow and the blade twisted and the twilight warden and the paunch that is 4 wh2 dlcs off the top of my head that came with 2 lords and 1 flc lord now in wh3 we still get 3 lords but you took the flc one and put it into the paid dlc that doesnt warrant a 150 price increase

if you read all of this then you must be a masochist 


update 14th december 

its been about three months since i last updated this review and so many people in that time have upvoted my review so i wanted to say again thanks for taking the time to read my long winded rant

alot has happened around tw in the last three months hyenas was cancelled pharaoh had an awful launch and casega have obviously felt the consequences as of the statement that ca posted today they are dropping the retail price for pharaoh refunding current owners part of the price they paid and now the upcoming dlc for pharaoh will be free i do approve of them doing this we all knew pharaoh was a saga title its retail price always shouldve been 2535 i cant help but still be cynical though this seems like an offramp for casega regarding pharaoh i think they want to see if the playerbase increases significantly with the new changes before committing too much

now about warhammer shadows of change is going to get a major update next year by the wording in cas statement it seems the 1999 retail price for lord packs is sticking i think we all have to wait and see if this major update will justify that price in socs current state i didnt even purchase it at 13 when it was on sale at a thirdparty seller recently they are really going to have to add alot and improve the quality to justify their pricing theyre really playing a dangerous game in my opinion but value is what matters 

the next thing is will i consider buying soc before thrones of decay has released i want to see the quality of the games development increase and i want it to be consistently high quality soc could be revised and become the best dlc but what if tod at 1999 is another mess like soc

but whats more important at the moment is the current state of the game the ai is in a new awful state the game is too easy the hotfixes are appreciated but please ca the ai needs more attention before more dlcs come

give us money or well kill warhammer 3

kill it

creative assembly has decided that going to war with their playerbase is the best option in light of recent failings poor marketing anticonsumer practices and outright hostile community management here on steam 

what was once a thriving studio and series has become a collection of broken promises aggressive sales tactics and outright threats on the community

while currently in the process of trying to walk all this back the damage has been done dlc prices have increased while content has decreased when concerns of this were raised the community was quite literally told to buy it or support would be dropped when it was pointed out that support doesnt really exist due to the continuation of major bugs broken ai and gameplay balancing issues the response was to ban people 

when it was pointed out that making a hero shooter with hyenas was a terrible idea and the community wants rome 3 empire 2 or something along those lines again the community is told to shut up and get in line 

hyenas has been canceled to the tune of millions in losses and jobs cut somehow the problem in all this is the community

when pharaohs got announced it was met with a criticism and push bask as a reskin of total war troy and pushing a sagas title smaller budget scale and price as a full scale total war release wasnt at all what the community wanted

bare in mind during all this ca dropped support for three kingdoms because despite selling well and getting good response it wasnt big enough for segaca so they killed the project 

apparently a team of just 20 people work on total warhammer content now and cas studio size has been reduced by 40 with hostilities continuing towards the community though ca is trying to walk it back with a nonapology once they got enough push back for banning mod creators on steam which locked them out of updating their mods or even uploading new ones guess ca realized it wasnt the best idea ot remove those actually helping their game

im 100 in support of boycotting ca products until this sort of stuff is addressed and the community given the respect it deserves ive been playing total war games since the original shogun hit store shelves back in 2000 there was a time when i held out hope wed see shogun 3 but these days i question if studio management and sega will allow the studio to continue long enough to release another game let alone something the community is actually interested in playing 

been over 10 years since rome ii released and since then its been calls for rome iii shogun 3 medieval iii and empire 2 yet beyond the total warhammer releases theyve largely missed the mark for bringing something new the community wants three kingdoms had its success but ca and sega werent happy with fan spending so despite being from 2019 the project is dead buried and forgotten about 

oh and ca is quick to blame steam for their harsh treatment of the community as someone who has moderated discussion boards on here before for games thats a load of crap but ca is used to shoveling crap to fans so it is on brand 

rip creative assembly

#####

oh you want to ban people from the steam forum for criticising you ca here have a bad review

#####

how dare you to threaten your community after so many years of support

nice pr statement guys really well done ill get your dlcs for 75 in few years if game is even playable at that point

the right to positive reviews is a privilege

two lord packs from wh2

4 legendary lords with new or reworked mechanics
occasional flc lord legendary hero or both to accompany a lord pack
anywhere between 46 new units  new generic lord type per faction
68 new regiments of renown per faction
20 total 10 each

one wh2 race pack

4 legendary lords
at least two generic lord types with possible variants for magic and loadouts
completely new faction with unique mechanics and unit rosters built from the ground up
18

shadows of change lord pack

3 legendary lords for already existing factions with new or unique mechanics
one legendary hero with a cool gimmick and maybe one flc legendary hero to come
less than half the new units that one faction would get in a single wh2 lord pack
25

you do the math 150 markup in price for starkly less content in one pack than if you just paid less to buy two of the old packs and all this after the game has been on modding life support due to ca being unwilling to get on top of major bugfixes multiplayer desyncs and other game breaking issues for well over a year and a half now

review isnt changing until this new dlc pricing model changes absolutely insulting

h1total war warhammer 3  an actual reviewh1

its quite difficult finding an actual review on twwarhammer 3 as the steam page is taken up by cas exploitative dlc policies their dumb forum comments and the white knights trying to defend everything ill get to all that stuff in a while but hows the actual game

ugame playu
just in case someone doesnt know heres the quick and dirty about the tw series its a turn based 4x game on the strategic map and a expansive rts on the tactical battles its geared more towards combat exterminate than the other 3xs explore expand exploit with those engaging rts fights if you really are new to the series this game has a pretty thorough tutorial as well bonus points for that

as someone who owns all 3 tw warhammer games im actually at a bit of a loss to find the differences between war 2 and 3 there are different factions available in warhammer 3 and some quality of life improvements a few new interesting mechanics and expanded settlement battles the settlement battles were divisive on launch but i personally i think theyre decent if a bit confusing the improvements are minor but they do add up

the combat maps are decidedly better with a few more obstacles hills and the like to use to your advantage the maps have come a long way since the wideopen warhammer 1 maps graphics have been improved over the life of the series and the game is really a joy to look at 

of course there are the new factions ive been playing grand cathay for the last 30 hours and they feel right to me i like generally playing the good factions and tend to turtle a bit having a faction with some decent troops behind a huge wall is kind of up my alley but im looking forward to playing some of the other factions as well thats the thing about this series especially if you have the prior games and dlcs as long as you dont get bored of the game play theres always someone new to play

the main draw of either is in owning the previous entries war 2 has the mortal empires mode which combines the factions and maps of warhammer 1 and warhammer 2 if you own both games on the same platform warhammer 3 has the immortal empires game mode which has the combined maps and factions of all three games its massive with about 180 factions playing at the start but if you dont own the prior games youre going to be very very frustrated when you open the game and find there are around 25 different factions to play and you have access to maybe 6 or 7 of them more on the dlc later

the worldbuildingcitymanagement hasnt changed much you still build from a relatively small pool of buildings level 5 for a capital 3 for a settlement grow your city to build better troops depending on your difficulty level you may find yourself swimming in money which means its time to build more armies and fight some more

ive already mentioned the rts battles theyre really good here the warhammer universe with its magic and very diverse unit types really suits this engine in some prior tw games the combat felt samey very quickly as you fought essentially the same units with different skins over and over again not so here each race feels very different and i find myself trying to understand my opponents more in this game what do they have magic flying units poison mega artillery how do i overcome that of course theres always the autoresolve for when you get tired of combat

ubugs dlc creative assembly and community uproaru
it wouldnt be a fair review if i didnt mention why this game has mixed ratings 

1 by all accounts it released in a pretty bad state  buggy slow etc i didnt get into this until the 41 patch and in 30 hours ive hit only 1 bug that caused me to have to drop to the desktop there may be some other bugs and issues with factions but im not in the weeds enough to know what those are there are still some lengthy loading times for combat maps 30 seconds to 1 minute as well so while it was buggy its not really that way any longer still you only have one chance to make a first impression and war 3s wasnt great for many folks

2 the dlc policies are exploitative first of all if you dont own twwar 1 and 2 youre going to hate loading this game up because most of the immortal empires races will be locked if youre still enjoying warhammer 2 and you are looking to expand your experience you would do well to purchase the first game right now instead of the third its cheaper has just as much new content and will enable you to play mortal empires which is an incredible campaign youll get to explore the old world from warhammer 1 which then borders the location of warhammer 3 so youll be able to orient yourself better if you go on to complete the trilogy at some point on the future 

3 then there are the dlc prices 25 for the chaos dwarves thats insane they raised the prices of their dlc and now are offering less content for each yes the dlc is optional but its still justwrong especially for loyal fans who own the first 2 games and much of that dlc shame

4 then theres creative assemblys attitude towards their community  theres really no excuse for their widespread forum bans or telling people the right to leave a negative comment on the forums is a privilege theyve also gone to war with some of their best youtube channels like legend of tw frankly  ca needs a rectalcranial extraction the community has every right to be upset and ca needs to do better

h1conclusionh1
when it comes right down to it im enjoying the game the game play races immortal empires campaignits a pretty great experience so yeah im going to recommend it with the caveats i mentioned above 
1 if you have 1  2 and enjoy the game play then 3 is pretty much a mustbuy 
2 if you dont have 1  2 and want to try one of these titles with a good tutorial this is also a great choice so long as you understand the dlc spam 
3 but if you have that fomo and youre going to get upset about not having access to 80 of the races in immortal empires stay clear go buy #2 get some of the dlc on sale and play that one instead youre getting pretty much the same experience for less money then if you want to expand buy the 1st game for more races only then should you dive into #3

#####

i really really want to love this game ive played over 3000 hours of its predecessor and was beyond excited for this game to come out

the main problems

1 cost dlc  chaos dwarfs was the most expensive dlc to date but the upcoming shadows of change is a slap in the face to everyone who supported and loved these games it asks for 25 usd for a few units and three legendary lords prior examples in the previous games offered the same exact thing for 10 including one of the legendary lords being free for everyone even then the free lord would still be high quality more often than not free ones have included imrik and rakarth for the high elves and dark elves respectively which became many peoples favorite way to play the entire faction

2 updates have slowed to a crawl  the game is still littered with significant bugs nearly a year and a half after its release communication has been uncharacteristically absent compared to the norms of the previous games at times gamebreaking bugs like nakais inability to recruit kroxigors the units he specializes in have been present for three months or longer this particular bug was fixed for free by a modder in about 5 minutes of work which leads us to

3 the games future is uncertain and troubling a previous game in the total war series three kingdoms was met with a huge positive response upon release but the dlcs and updates seemed disconnected and disappointing for many players whenever new content came out gamebreaking bugs would follow including ones that would never be fixed when the purchases began to slow down the entire project was unceremoniously cancelled

many people fear that this game might inherit the fate of three kingdoms the official response to this price hike has been troubling at best many people have invested hundreds or thousands of hours of this series and wanted to see it through dlcs were bought consistently and regularly because there was trust and goodwill towards the developer and while they may not have been perfect each would often lead to countless hours of enjoyment and unique opportunities and ways to play the game

i and many others just want a return to form we want to be excited for new content not anxious many of us are more than willing to pay for content that shines with love and care such as what has already been accomplished in warhammer ii we want to feel secure in the games future without worrying if or when the skeleton crew will be recalled we want to see that the game is cared for and that bugs especially significant and simple ones are addressed we want more open and transparent communication and to see that feedback is being respected we are upset because we put so much of ourselves into this game and want it to be as great as it can be living up to the potential that has already been created and witnessed

if warhammer ii was any indication when the developers are allowed the time and resources to make something great the community by and large wont think twice about getting dlc that meets a respectable quality for the price we dont want the future and functionality of the game to be tied to exponential price hikes and radio silence we want something close to what we already had and what has already been made time and time again

many have been invested in this game series for over 7 years many have been waiting with excitement for the conclusion to the trilogy of phenomenal games the people who have been hurt the most by this abrupt and inexplicable shift are the ones who have been there for years and have happily and willingly supported the game and all of its content the ask is only to get something close to what we already had  to what had already been developed sold and delivered to us many times before for better or worse the treatment of this game will affect the future of the developer publisher and playerbase make it count

launch a good game in 2016
runs smoothly
great looking game for its time
pile dlc lordsfactions on top of it for reasonable prices

launch a sequel in 2017
runs decently
looks pretty good for the time
pile even more dlc lordsfactions on top of it for a good price when theyre on sale

launch total warhammer 3 in 2022
runs terribly
in spite of the poor performance it looks nearly the same as the 2016 version sometimes worse
a dlc pack that would have been 999 in the past is now 2499 inflation doesnt begin to justify this

its really unfortunate
i really enjoy the warhammer oldworld settling and warhammer 2016 was the only time ive seen it get a fair representation in videogame form aside from the excellent warsword conquest mod for warband

considering this is likely to be the last iteration of the total warhammer franchise and that the studio is already planning to abandon total warhammer iii and move on to something more profitable im hoping to see mods improve the game in some way
although this is a ca game were talking about and we know what they do to modders


oh also this can go on the franchises tombstone

the right to discuss is a privilege  it is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game

banning people from the steam forum for criticizing ca is a scummy and disrespectful move ca

#####

the dlc policy is a complete ripoff they add the bare minimum of new factions they can get away with and then charge you  half the price of the full game to add a new one every few months i get needing to make money and i have no problems with games that cost 6070 but this just leaves a sour taste in my mouth that makes me not ever come back to your games

#####

their best seller now has the worst rating for a tw game on steam hyena cancelled before launch pharaoh dead on arrival and this company absolutely deserves all of it

#####

youre threatening to take warhammer 3 away of people dont buy dlc

did you forget that this ipcrossover literally saved your company

#####

give us money or well kill warhammer 3

yeaaaaah thats gonna be the last time i buy anything from this franchise

#####

buy on sale in a year or twos time it is not ready

#####

edit the most recent update is certainly a step in the right direction antiplayer bias was reduced and a lot of big issues such as replenishment was improved for some factions whoever is now managing the project seem to be more receptiveinvolved with the community ill keep this as negative still for now but its finally improving the way people asked

edit#2 game has fixed most of its launch issues now a few lay around waiting to ambush you at annoying moments but overall its a far better game now im leaving the review up as i personally am very exhausted of total war games coming out with horrific balance and would like this to serve as a reminder if this game came out in the state it is now in it would be a big thumbs up

ooof where to start the fact that it wasnt ready the fact that they doubled down on things people hated in the other games the freakishly slow updates to get some of the most basic issues fixed the fact a warhammer game needs almost an entire year to get blood added a warhammer game where you can play as the blood god the fact the main campaign is an absolute miserable experience theres just so much more  ill start with the positives

the main positive i could give is that factions have much more engaging mechanics to them than earlier games even if their rosters are miserably small no were trying to say something nice here ogres feel actually finished as a roster with interesting mechanics and a wide variety of units

the bad well its difficult to explain how extremely bad some of these things are with a character limit so short i could write multiple pages about the design flaws in the main campaign flaws ranging from complex issues that are difficult to deal with to amateur design choices that youd imagine get thrown out the first time they slip from anyones lips let alone added to a 60 aaa title

the campaign is effectively a race which gets triggered every 2030 turns unfortunately this absolutely kills the pacing of the base total war gameplay everything comes to a halt as you enter chaos realms to get a soul first only to realiize that you are the only one playing this game the ai is not playing the same game as you at all they do not have the same challenges they do not get the same debuffs they do not have to complete the same puzzles they do not need buildings to recruit units they do not need to actually do anything you do they just automatically breeze through while you suffer the most miserable experiences of endless debuffs and being attacked by other enemies while your main army is in some pocket dimension the game actively punishes you for playing the game as intended expanding your settlements and empire means the ai will disproportionately focus you allowing their own home to be burned down with no reaction while sending 3 armies to your doorstep maybe get allies they could be useful if there wasnt an in game design that makes any ai who you alliance with suddenly become the most passive and weak faction yes if you alliance with an ai they actually get their ai debuffed to not do anything by themselves the ai is just so obviously ai due to its comical level of player targeting bias shamelessly doing anything it can to stop you while doing nothing else the entire game an issue so bad even the developers have had to admit it needs fixing just keep in mind this was not added as a bug this was the intended design

the game is such a mess everything has been put on hold months dedicated to fix the horrific design choices that were baked deep into the game also 7 months needed to fix replenishment for 2 factions what is going on over there how does it take 7 months to fix things that modders fixed within hours of mods coming out

give it a year or a little more then it might be in a launchable state sadly it could have been good but ca decided to ignore feedback and stick with whatever they wanted to do lets hope that changes fast

it is a shame really video games have become some sort of pseudo wall street where it seems that the only that matters is money we made less game for more money perfect itll increase our profit margins



i think that as long as investors shareholders and executive types are a thing in this industry matters will only get worse that or you know stop preordering games and take a stand it sucks i get it and many do not have the time to be engaged and involved with a video game protest with only a couple of hours per day to relax i get that some would rather just bite the bullet and i cannot judge people for doing that but if you can you should

so long as we keep paying for underdelivered bs they will keep underdelivering bs i feel bad for the devs i really do

#####

i have dabbled in the game and i really like total war as a series but i wont buy anymore dlcs until the price point comes down they are not delivering on the quality of their dlcs anymore to meet the price point they are asking 50 of the base cost of a standard full game for a dlc with 1 faction or a few more units and balancing that should be free anyway i just feel that creative assembly really is losing touch with its community which is sad i have moved on to other games until ca gets its act in gear and makes content for its community again quality content

at the moment this game is a green banana

imagine this you painstakingly  tactically and strategically play each turn of your 150 turn legendary difficulty campaign to perfection  building an empire fit for the gods  becoming strength rank 1 and a huge economy you also have 3 souls out of 4 along with an ai then all of a sudden because the ai was able to get the 4th soul within 2 turns of entering the realms of chaos  the shitty puzzle like realm  which is full of rng teleportation you now only have one chance to stop them a popup message appears and warns you that you only have once chance to stop them from entering the forge of souls so enter a rift now to intercept them  but guess what you cant enter to intercept because on the very turn the message told you the warning  the rifts have run out their allotted 15 turns now somehow even while dominating the ai via clever diplomacy  economy management and military conquest you lose the entire campaign to some text popup messageessentially losing to a faction that had 3 settlements the other side of the map 010 would not play warhammer 3 again untill immortal empires the latest patch has not fixed this issue

good game really enjoy playing technologically advanced rodents for hours on end but when is total war lord of the rings coming

#####

like a lot of the total war community ive been a huge fan of the series for many years since shogun 2 
the turn to fantasy wasnt something that i liked the idea of but i fell in love with tw warhammer and have close to 3000 hours cumulatively between games 1 2 and 3 

i have purchased every single dlc throughout each games lifespan because i knew that each lord or race pack would add something fresh and exciting to the game for a reasonable price

unfortunately due to the recent price gouging with shadows of change i have to leave a negative review 
ca built up a huge amount of goodwill over the course of the trilogy but have manage to lose it all in the space of a year
tw warhammer 3 had a delayed launch and arrived unfinished with countless bugs and each update fixes one problem and causes two others 

the cost of living argument for a price increase of over 100 is laughable the current economic climate affects the people that play and make these games not the corporations that make profits in the hundreds of millions 

if ca came out and said the dlcs have been increased in price so that we can pay our staff increased wages then perhaps the rising cost would be palatable but that obviously isnt the case

until a custodian team is created to patch the game and ensure things run smoothly and allow tw wh3 the lifespan that its exceptional creative vision deserves the game isnt worth buying or playing 

in the meantime i highly recommend stellaris whilst paradox love an overpriced dlc they actually make custodian teams also the series is on sale at the time of writing

tldr the game is good but the monetisation is horrid 

the game got review bombed because people kept shitting on creative assembly for that exact reason on forums and they locked it stating leaving negative reviews is a privilege which shows an incredible lack of 
self awareness or care for their playerbase no matter how much they walk it back its hard to trust a developer that has that much disdain for their playerbase concerns
get it when its on sale or find other means thatll save you the exorbitant amount of money this game costs for you to enjoy every part of it

pros
 there is a hand holding tutorial for new players looking to get into the game so if youre worried about the complexity dont be as its as easy to get into as it will ever be

 almost every faction is unique in some way you can be the evil world conquering demon or the world defending high elves and everything in between i didnt know how much i needed fantasy slavs with bear cavalry and ice magic until i played as kislev some factions are truly great in fantasy and gameplay

 multiple ways to play each faction almost all of them have multiple leaders that can change how you play the game want to focus on getting an army of dragons as the high elves play imrik want to build yourself up to be the mage in the backline that can solo destroy entire armies with one spell play tectis who is also part of the high elves every leader has their own win condition and start position as well so if you enjoy playing a certain faction you can simply play as a different leader and have a replayable experience 

 a lot more polish and jank cleanup from the previous titles there are some minor ui downgrades but if youre new to the series these wont bother you 

 the maps you fight on are varied and in some cases unique if youre fighting near major landmarks or city sieges it honestly blew me away how beautiful some of the scenery was when i first saw it they didnt have to go that extra level but they did and i appreciate it a lot strategically theyre a lot better as well with more environmental obstacles to play around and city sieges arent the worst part of the game like they were in previous titles

 mod support every game should have mod support and im glad this one does

cons
 everything about the monetisation the base game is very barren and while you dont need any dlc as its all just extra factions or leaders to play as and there is no pay walling features like in crusader kings or stellaris if you want to have fun with a lot the game has to offer youre going to be paying a ludicrous amount of money to do so for example in the immortal empires campaign which is what most people play and most content is made from there is a massive world spanning most of the warhammer fantasy universe and you have access to i think 8 factions with no dlc there are about 80 playable individual heroes if you have all the extra content 
well okay i hear you say that sounds really bad but if i just wait for a sale and then target the factions that interest me i can still have a good time right to an extent youd be correct but most of these factions are locked behind owning the previous games which on steam at their current price are around 70 cad each which does not include the non free dlc for those games so if you want to play lets say the tomb kings cool ancient egyptian based faction but theyre all undead and trying to restore their great empire to what it once was sounds great right well youre going to have to buy warhammer ii and the tomb kings dlc which is currently at regular price 90 cad for both now sure you get a bunch of other factions for simply owning warhammer ii which can be seen as a great deal especially when on sale but a new player is not going to know how this works unless they do research when they do find this out it has got to be a massive turn off for a lot of new players to this franchise and i think thats a massive shame as the game itself is pretty great

 the skill trees for heroes can feel a bit underwhelming depending on who youre playing as especially later in the game once you get a hero past level 20 it almost feels like a chore sometimes to level them up unless youre gunning for some specific archetype thats supported by them otherwise its just kind of lame stat increases or debuffs couldve been a lot cooler

 the actual diplomacy and non total war part of the game is a bit barren everything you want is there but its very bare bones and theres almost no depth to it with how crazy detailed and varied the battles are i get why its like this but just a heads up for anyone who cares

 graphical variance is kind of wack some factions are very clearly ported from older titles some portraits and landscapes look really washed out and bad compared to the newer stuff maybe theyll touch on that in a future update and its nothing major but itd be nice to have some fixes for it



  i waffled back and forth on giving this a positive or a negative review but i think at the end of the day its a good game and deserves better than a mixed rating that steam shows it truly is a great experience if you have all the bells and whistles and it can give you thousands of hours of enjoyment and frustration i wish some things were better and that more people could experience this great game but unfortunately i dont see creative assembly getting any better as time goes on if you make 80k a year at lockheed martin and still live with your parents id say give it a try your money isnt going to anything better anyway for the other wage slaves of the world who cant stomach giving around 200 dollars to a company for dlc factions maybe its best you steer clear of this game

#####

these dlc prices just got way way way to high
many people here seem to suffer from stockholm syndrom but 25 euros for dlc packs like that is just way to much

espacially with such a low frequence of bug fixes and free improvements 

no inflation in the world can justify price hikes like this

#####

game good
campaign bad 
wait for mortal empires

#####

after the release of the roadmap today the game has no worth until next year save your money and buy it on sale a year or two from now

#####

as soon as ca decided that threatening the end of support of the game if we dont adhere to new pricing was the best plan of attack after the backlash of the monsterous dlc pricing hike the company has shown its true colors and the fanbase wont have any more of it

go back to the rome 2 launch you will see the same clown writing the same post back then too rob bartholomew should be fired but he wont be this is what happens when you have leverage in a company and can say and do whatever you want

well the community has shown you we dont like your words of despair too bad the damage is done perhaps games workshop will go else where

its a shame especially when i have thousands of hours on this trilogy

do not buy this title

i dont even really like this game i just keep coming back because the funny rat men are my only real friends

warhammer 3 is like a new pair of expensive shoes with a tiny piece of glass jumbling around in it that you will never get out you will turn it upside down and shake it you will change socks youll walk differently youll think youve taken care of it and youll feel amazing in your new shoes on a beautiful day for a while and then youre stung again

foremost is that its addicting because of its excellent core gameplay and there always being something new to try or get better at wh3 is huge various and its good its awesome even  speaking as someone who played rome shogun and medieval 2 for a decade if i want to play medieval again ill just start a bretonnia campaign and thats just one of the many factions unless i want better music prebattle speeches and those cool event movies

as you find out things that excite you engross you and build your book of strategies you will find out other things such as

 the loooooooaaddd times actively discouraging manual battling
 the performance is poor for the visual quality  especially on minimum it still chugs after you make it look like dough  and you need mods to demake it enough to not cook your gpu
 the amount of factionslords you can play with the base game is low and youre expected to have warhammer 1 and 2 to access their races and a lot of dlc after youve already paid full price dlc content isnt intrinsically bad but its likely that youll be a bit disappointed if you just purchase wh3
 new factions are starkly powercrept old ones are being updated but at a glacial pace
 there exists a downright silly antiplayer bias where enemies will sometimes ignore all reason and selfpreservation to march full stacks at you from preposterous distances sometimes they declare war the instant you discover them and perhaps they were building armies and waiting in the fog doing nothing but waiting only to launch them at you once you meet them even though they were adjacently surrounded by other hostile targets edit this may have been retuned as of 40 will update later
 the empire is supposed to suck and have an agonizing start position and it being recommended as a beginner faction is a cruel joke
 chaos is the main character and general favourite and you will feel it
 enemies take less attrition in higher difficulties to the point of rendering it irrelevant this hurts vampire skaven tomb king and nurgle players
 skaven plagues do unavoidable unmitigatable attrition to an army putting it out of commission for 5 turns plus 25 more to heal back up moreover they do not care if you are allied with them allying with skaven does not stop them from plagueing you because they plague your common enemy and they spread for a long time
 having war declared while being next to your new enemys lord or city will trap you inside of their zoneofcontrol and not let you leave unless you initiate an attack and then retreat
 some critical strategies that make your faction notmiserable or even quite powerful will take many hours and new attempts to discover unless you watch a video first in other words racial tutorials are barebones and dont describe practical play expectations
 as cathay chaos will ignore the great bastion outside of a rare scripted event and backdoor you with a hilarious 20 turn journey through the mountains
 the ability to build walls around minor settlements was removed even at the maximum growth stage and maximum wall building tier huh
 unit performance is notinsignificantly dictated by an undocumented animation metagame which governs splash damage and entity finishers
 quests and grudges that require raiding a region or attacking a citylord with a hero dont complete if you do more than that claiming the region claiming the city or slaying the lord in battle nope you have to specifically raid that region and you fail the quest if you conquer it instead
 every time you leave a section of your border undefended you are punished severely and have to learn repeatedly to always expect the most annoying inconvenient bs to occur even if taking it slow means crippling your campaign this does make some starts where youre totally exposed on multiple fronts reliant on big gambles
 pathfinding around walls in siege battles may cause hemorrhoids
 playing chasethegoose with an enemy lord in march stance that just perfectly slipped by you will cause hemorrhoids
 ai factions have a hidden faction potential which gives them artificial extra production regardless of difficulty and autoresolve power when fighting each other legendarylord factions have much more fp than minor factions and will erase them by virtue of fp difference rather than actual military difference this also means allying with minor factions is pointless additionally when the player hasnt discovered these factions yet they have another invisible mechanic shroud their fpbased autoresolve advantage is doubled this means that you drastically change the nature of the world simply by having vision of it and if youre not careful you can significantly nerf factions you like while distant enemies keep their undiscovered bonus fp is both randomized and weighted based on your starting faction so now you change the nature of the world just by what faction you start with this is silly its understandable to give ai production and military bonuses based on difficulty but to include these arbitrary invisible modifications just confuses the player and tempts them to metagame rather than play normally beyond your comprehension
 if your ambush trigger fails and the enemy declines to engage he can just walk right through your army and raze your settlement instead of being forced to retreat backward like the player is
 while passing your turn and sieging an enemy city if they sally out to fight you and you dont slay enough troops such that the enemy garrison survives and you dont claim the city your siege is canceled and a all of your equipment building progress is lost b attrition will not tick that turn and c another faction can initiate their own siege on the city stealing the tag from you
new factions are added without care to how they affect the situation of old factions the immediate neighbours of chaos dwarfs perhaps the most juiced up faction to exist received no rebalancing when they were added despite it wholly changing the nature and demands of their faction starts

the dammaz kron shuts
other than that its fun sometimes a lot of fun see the shoe metaphor

if youre looking for more complex diplomacy and economy other tws like three kingdoms would be more to your taste however in my opinion tw diplomacy was never good no matter how deep it was and having to meticulously manage your trade network would be silly in the face of kragbock teh eternel killer coming out of the fog whose sole responsibility is to  well its in the name diplomacy is there and its deep enough though missing a joint war declaration option instead of one of you having to be at war first it could be tuned better economy is the same different factions have fairly different styles of diplomacy and economy so i suppose thats how the game makes up for it 

breadth over depth but not too shallow that same principle applies to much of the title

i reiterate buyer beware if you expect to make a single purchase or even a few and be done with it

#####

give it a year or so this game needs serious serious work

edit 1 well played ca well played really made impressive progress on this immortal empires is a huge breath of fresh air and its all coming together nicely  still only recommend on sale for now

edit 2 

the price of wh1 and 2 have risen to the cost of a new game this is a vile move by ca steam sega all of them 

wh1 for 3999 disgusting

#####

good news to those who are new and only bought total war warhammer iii you can now try out the immortal empire go watch the epic new immortal empires launch trailer on total war youtube channel 

great move ca

#####

i love this game but absolutely despise what cas managment is doing at the moment f for devs and all people who work hard there

#####

rewrite of original review


the game only becomes worth it after buying all the dlc if you want the complete experience youre gonna have to pay up 90 of the content is locked behind dlc so its already very hostile to newer players although i will still recommend this game in order to make myself feel better after flushing my money down the drain

its still good albeit buggy though

i didnt have to write down my entire life story and how total war warhammer iii indirectly saved me from a car crash


#####

after you pay 300 for the 1st and 2nd game and all of their dlc plus the dlc for this game then you can have fun and play

#####

edit well the wait is over and it was not fixed in fact its gotten worse

ca is bracing themselves for two major flops in hyenas who asked for this and tw pharaoh why are they putting out more tw before this one is fixed and are trying to wring the deficit out of their only loyal community instead of focusing on their flagship game theyre charging higher prices for less content and telling the players to just suck it up lol

dont wait skip its a crying shame

original review

wait

seriouisly wait this game needs so much work before its worth the asking price the top reviews have done a fine job of getting into the granular details but in short this game was not finished and no one should drop full price on this or this pitiful 10 sale until its had at least another year in the oven

truly disappointing

if you are on nvidia go into the nvidia control panel  manage 3d settings  max frame rate  cap it below what you are currently getting in game as the game does not have an fps cap in the options menu
your gpu usage should get below 90 hopefully 
i was getting 76fps but my gpu was hitting 100 load i capped my fps at 60fsp now my gpu is 88 on the world map and is running at reasonable temperatures hope this helps


always been an avid fan of the series excited to get warhammer 3 finally

#####

my advice at this point is to wait for the immortal empires release to see if this is worth playing

pros
relatively fun units lords and faction mechanics
the graphics are about what you would expect from a sequel
cons
the campaign just fails on so many levels
      1 the actual campaign mechanics  dont feel rewarding and are oftentimes more punishing as you progress realm of 
         chaos is just a torturous bore that doesnt really offer any reward and particularly in tzeentchs realm its a crap shoot 
         of racing the enemy ai and hoping you randomly choose the correct portal path
      2 random warp portals this is just monumentally frustrating and with limited armies can often lead to positions of 
          you just hoping youve lucked out in having the appropriate forces in the right position if the ai goes for any kind of 
          jankiness expect to waste an army or several dedicated to sitting in your important economicproduction territories 
         this is particularly necessary if the ai decides to build up a few stacks before bumrushing a city
 city battles the ai does not interact well with cities offense or defense units defending points that you arent attacking or wandering units back and forth at random between points 
the ai in general is just bad easily abuseable at all difficulties on the battle map and there are many times you will have to abuse it because the ai cheat stats at higher difficulties makes trying to play with basic tactics moot ie spearsantilarge  infantry dont really do anything to units they supposedly counter melee infantry is basically useless in the face of more ranged units regular cavalry units are generally not good so basically the strat tends to wind down to hide the army exposing a single fast moving unit usually  a lord and break the ai by luring out a unit at a time to pound into the dust via mass range spammagic khorne has some leeway with the free armies they can spam out for disposable melee but yeah ultimately not a good time
the campaign ai is just bad with the cheats to compete with the player also antiplayer bias is hilarious watching the ai ignore 6 full stacks  of another ai they are at war with to come barreling down at you the players out of the way undefended minor settlement while they get utterly ransacked and it doesnt mean anything because the ai isnt playing under any of the constraints that the player has to deal with on the campaign map beyond movement 


#####

the right to discuss is a privilege  it is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game
creative assembly 2023

just found out that discussing is a privilege not a right didnt realise my game came with a freedom of speech dlc that unlocks a new legendary lord with 2 new units and my discussion privilege in the tech tree only for 2999 and guys you gotta give that to ca thats only because of the inflation 

creative assembly seems to be working on their new total absurdity franchise and i definitely would not debate again especially after threatening the fanbase with cutting out support for the game

#####

this is an abusive relationship

#####

this game was published months to early as of now

the problem is this is not a finished game and it was planned exactly like that

that would have been okay as you get a little content to allow you to play until the actual campaign comes

what makes it problematic is that the content we actually get is utterly dull repetitive and already needed a big fix patch for many problems

in fact the problems are so big ca postponed the content this game so desperately needs to create solutions on the foundation

a good step of course but too late now that the game is published for full price no less people want to play and despite you get more factions than ever to start with you barely have anything to do with them

ca should have postponed the game as a whole to care for all the problems this game has that way our expections would still be when will the game be published instead of when will we get the needed content

its a problem with expectations too high the grand finale and game pushed out too carelessly

its not a bad game if we get the content it is planned to be published with no it would be a damn awesome game thats what this shows

but it is a demonstration version for a full price for whats yet to come this is not a full game

dont treat it as such

add the game got better due to some patches its still not a great game it does what a total war game does other total war games are better this is still not the game it could be and that the developer thinks it is see the abnormal prices for dlcs

add fans are angry about the pricing policy 25 for a simple lord pack with three lords and nof much else in shadows of change for example and how does creative asdembly react they announced they will delete discussions about prices and possibly ban people from their communities fine

as a reviewer though i feel i gotta tell you about that talking about prices should be allowed for customers bad move wouldnt recommend to buy a game with such pricing and community policy

#####

its a great game but no reason to rush into buying it just yet

lets start with the negatives

the major problem is that performance is not good even in high end systems its going to take a few patches for ca to optimize it the ai is also acting weird and could use a bit of tweaking 

the campaign is fun the first time you play but it feels too much like a time attack at times i just wish there was more time to explore and expand in between the chaos gates opening the way its structured means that you actually have an advantage if you dont expand too much and keep your faction leader near a major settlement in order to rush into chaos gates get demon souls rest at settlement to remove negative traits and rinse repeat 

the final battle whilst very challenging the first time you play it gets much easier after you realize what are the optimal unit types to bring and what strategy to follow 

theres a few glitches but nothing too gamebreaking in my experience most annoying thing ive encountered was camera acting weird in battle maps with steep declining cliffs

on to the positives

graphically and visually stunning truly a work of art both in environments and units the battle maps have been improved sieges maps especially

diplomacy and alliances are greatly improved trading settlements is back you can borrow allied armies and easily see what theyre up to and you can even recruit allied units i really really hope they transfer these changes to the next historical total wars outstanding

the factions are all great and they have interesting and unique gameplay mechanics both in campaign and battles everything feels distinct

they finally did away with the web paged encyclopedia and its back into being locally stored

i havent tried the multiplayer campaigns just yet but they finally increased player count it was about time for this change and cant wait to start some campaigns with friends when mortal empires map launches

the game will really shine bright when the mortal empires map launches that unites all three total warhammer games into one beast of a game if youre on the fence maybe just wait until then game will be a masterpiece by then

#####

lets be honest you didnt buy this game to play crappy realms of chaos campaign instead you bought it to play the complete version of trilogy as immortal empires
its going to be finally here on 23rd august and i can finally move from warhammer ii where i have almost 2000 hours to warhammer iii this is gonna be epic which will keep me occupied for another 4 years like the previous game in the series did
the only negative i can think about it at this point is if you are coming new to the game you need to buy tww1 and tww2 and all of their dlcs to get the full experience in immortal empires and altogether you are looking at over 200

#####

i can no longer in good conscience support this dev positive review is a privilege not an entitlement

#####

much love to the artists programmers game testers engineers level designers writers and animators of the game

no love to marketers and the people at the top taking a fantastic series and using every scummy tactic to squeeze as much money as possible for their own mistakes without any accountability

#####

coop campaigns are so much better with simultaneous turns 1010

#####

did you ever notice that when you look at a game on the steam store those strategy rpg action etc tags on the side are actually user defined did you know that clicking on the little plus allows you to add tags that you feel fit the game and the ones that are popular will be added to the list did you know one of those tags is early access

given the state of the game on launch combined with the recent road map for even an attempt at fixing the state of the game i think its only fair to call this an early access game and have added the tag myself what do you think

#####

this game deserves the hates the playerbase steam award

#####

something about this ai is just frustrating im never excited for the next turn because i know its going to be something absurd i have thousands of hours in this trilogy but i cant stomach more than 40 turns of a campaign in this game before thinking i dont care enough to deal with this

it hardly ever feels like youre actually strategizing just playing wack a mole with factions that would gladly sacrifice their existence for the chance to march 24 turns through their enemies past my allies to blow up one settlement and then get deleted for it

before you know it you own a quarter of the map by just reacting to suicidal ai you dont even need to declare war they will constantly seek you out at this point id rather just skip the campaign map all together and just have battles strung together in a narrative campaign

battles are good praise sigmar

#####

no amount of beating around the bush is going to get around the fact that this game had a rough launch but its been a year since then and the devs have not stopped working on improving the game since then  and wont for the foreseeable future

as was the case with other total war games warhammer 3 will remain in development for years to come as the devs update older content and add new content to the game in the form of free downloadable content and paid dlc both so if youre looking for a definitive experience you wont find it here 

with that said at this point this game has improved so much since its launch that i can confidently say id rather load up a new wh3 campaign than go back to playing wh2  even though im a wh2 veteran of 2500 hours the maps of wh3 are better the features are better and the gameplay is still best in class 

and as such i will gladly recommend total war warhammer 3 as the first game to buy from this franchise

and as a psa the franchise frequently goes on sale i would highly recommend keeping an eye out for sales both on and off of steam as you can often save quite a bit of money currently most items are 50  off on steam as of this review

#####

look at my hours clearly i am a fan of this game i am leaving a negative review because of the clear decline of creative assemblys business practices and how it manifests in this title

idea is great the tw system is great warhammer is a perfect match for it unfortunatly we are witnessing the late stages of a great game developer the creative teams is split in an ineffective way and the executive team have clearly spent more hours studying for their mbas than actually reading the market and monitoring their communityproduct they are juicing this thing until its dead the game is bugged bad with no clear plan for meaningful overhaul the dlcs are getting more expensive with less content also buggy as heck lol and the qa team would rather silence and insult the community than fix the product

there are other great games out there get off this store page

#####

you were the chosen one it was said that you would destroy greedy capitalists not join them bring balance to the gaming industry not leave it in darkness

#####

i had internet problem for days and i couldnt play this game cuz of no internet lol in the past you could play tw without internet but they changed it ca scumbags

#####

yes its good now bring me total war  warhammer 40k kkthxbye 3

#####

i dunno what to say i continuously start new campaigns play 20 turns or so and then start anew in 71 hours ive gone through 13 of the factions but im not bored also im drunk

#####

im the engineer of merchant ship

and almost ship doesnt support internet but in port

i  need offline mod in this game why you guys made like this need internet to start this game

im so disappointment for this  plz help us


 problem solved
they fix offline gameplay and i can play at any condition

im so appreciate about that  love you guys thank yhou

#####

edit creative assembly has clarified that the drm was not the origin of the performance loss and there seems to have been a performance update bundled in with the champions of chaos update its a good start and i may be switching my thumbs down to a thumbs up after investigating the performance increase some more 

strike the game is very good and i would wholeheartedly recommend if it werent for the controversy surrounding the games current performance according to urlhttpswwwpcinvasioncomtotalwarwarhammer3technicalreview certain media outlets url the review build ran significantly better than the current build and in the case of the specific reviewer linked above lost over 50 fps on low settings on the current build of the game and on a monstrous machine at that urlhttpswwwredditcomrtotalwarcommentssv4bsxthe_review_builds_of_the_game_ran_much_betterthe community is speculating url that it was urlhttpswwwredditcomrtotalwarcommentssv5l2vca_released_a_patch_that_reduced_whiiis a large patch uploaded moments before the game went live that tanked the performance of the game possibly through the inclusion of denuvo antitemperurlaka antipiracy software 

regardless of the origins of this huge performance loss many reviewers and insiders advertised the game as running with similar performance as the previous instalment of the series currently if your pc was somewhat struggling to run i total war warhammer ii i you may potentially find yourself almost incapable of running the game at even below decent framerates beefier machines do not seem to be spared the performance loss although some may be able to bruteforce their way towards a better framerate if performance is a big deal to you or you possess a somewhat weaker machine id advise you to wait until this issue is resolved 

unfortunately if the performance loss is indeed a result of denuvo current players of this game may find themselves in a similar situation as purchasers of i doom eternal i did not so long ago in dooms case urlhttpswwweurogamernetarticles20200521doometernalremovingdenuvoanticheatfollowingbacklash#textin20particular2c20concerns20were20raisedof20the20anti2dcheat20softwaredenuvo was only removed after significant backlash url from urlhttpswwwredditcomrdoomcommentsgjzi01why_you_should_remove_doom_eternal_denuvoutm_mediumandroid_apputm_sourceshare the community url yes the techsavvy among you will no doubt mention that the denuvo software packaged with i doom eternal i was theoretically far more intrusiveworse than the denuvo software bundled with i total war warhammer iii i and although you might probably be right the core argument still stands that ca or sega may not feel pressured to address this issue unless there is significant public backlash similar to i doom eternal i to the best of my knowledge there has not yet been any communication from ca over this issue and the substantial performance loss in comparison to the review build but perhaps it is simply too early to tell 

if you are mindful of performance or possess a weaker machine id advise you not to purchase the game at the present moment if you already own the game and happen to read this review i urge you to write a similar review with a big thumbs down as long as performance isnt restored to review build levels considering the amount of people that based their performance expectations on prerelease videos this is borderline false advertisement if you are lazy but still wish to signal your disagreement feel free to copy and paste this review if you so desire 

i eagerly await the moment i can change this review to a thumbs up and promise to do so once ca takes action and resolves this issue strike

#####

before immortal empires i wouldnt have recommended warhammer iii as it was the realm of chaos campaign felt only like a showcase or a distraction of the new things for warhammer iii while they were making immortal empires the settlement siege battles quickly became tiring to play the ai often bumbled around both tactically and strategically the portals to the realm of chaos itself were frustrating to deal with same for actually visiting these locations and the overall performance of the game quite often caused the game to slow down to an unacceptable pace mostly around kislev at that time i only put roughly 65 hours into the game after finishing the kislev campaign and decided to wait

and now with immortal empires while some systems remain in place this feels like how warhammer iii shouldve released granted its still fairly buggy with a few issues popping up during my playthrough ive come back to finally start enjoying the mosh pit of races and factions on one giant map and playing the game the way i want to as it should be like with everyone else although the settlement siege battles are still rather obnoxious to deal with the ai still fumbles about on the occasion and the performance still slightly worrying at times its been a much better experience than it has been

compared to warhammer iis mortal empires there are some genuinely great changes that have been made here specifically the diplomacy which is far more interesting and intriguing and allowing for allies to truly shine better than being a downright disappointing doorstop for whatever comes knocking on the other side even being able to simply threaten a trespassing faction or add some intimidation to a deal youre trying to make adds more level of interest than ever before in my opinion of course

furthering this comparison is the addition of the end game dilemmas or calamities that may spring up although fairly simple in concept and idea its a better addition than warhammer iis chaos invasion mechanic in which chaos armies on northern and southern sides of the map spawn in numerous numbers to challenge the world although the player bias would disagree with that now its a system that involves a singular faction spawning numerous amounts of armies in a lore friendly location to perform their faction goal and with a slightly less player bias it suits the theme of total war much better than a single faction invading the way they did and it also draws end game out better and add more variety to it since dealing with only chaos felt like a chore more than anything

overall i highly recommend the immortal empires side of warhammer iii as i believe its a better representation of what the game should be a sandbox empire management game and while i still do not recommend the realm of chaos campaign its okay to have as a side dish to the main course

 still has bugs in it from launch 18 months later
 still has crashes destroying save files and killing campaigns
 jacked up dlc prices
 updates take far too long and the roadmap is insultingly slow
 performance and stability are still issues and change on a patchbypatch basis
 devs go radio silent when they mess anything up
 some races badly need reworks and some reworked races need reworking again
 devs removed cheese from wh2 and made the game worse as a result
 ai is laughably bad even with supposed improvements
 sieges are the worst in the series
 keep using the money generated from this game to fund other games instead of reinvesting it in the game
 pr department tries to put out the dumpster fire theyve caused with more petrol every time they make a statement
 rob bartholomew ca upper management threatened to end support for the game if dlc didnt sell enough in a really idiotic tweet
 banning people from steam forums indiscriminately

now that ive 100 the game and can only derive enjoyment from legendary campaign difficulty very hard battle difficulty anymore i think i can finally leave a well rounded review

this is definitely one of those games that i wish steam had a neutral review option for to give you an idea of where my thoughts are coming from i have over a thousand hours across the total war series and started over a decade ago in middle school with medieval ii

this is easily the most diverse of the franchise by far with the variety of races and the rosters for each one and it has an incredibly good modding scene the battles are as cinematic as it gets and the game is beautiful on max settings this entry in the franchise also has the most robust multiplayer campaign with the player slots going up to 10 medieval iii multiplayer campaigns please the variety of lords heroes schools of magic and tech trees for all the races allows for a variety of playstyles as well however its really more of an illusion of choice because when it comes down to it each legendary lord has their bread and butter to the point that with all the stat buffs you get between perks and research youll steamroll armies that are composed of units that are supposed to counter you agents heroes will 99 of the time be incorporated in your armies and be objectively better as a battlefield unit than for their campaign map purposes ive beaten multiple legendary campaigns without utilizing an agent on the campaign map even once which i feel shows their lack of impact if theyre just a side option instead of being absolutely essential for well rounded play sieges and settlement battles honestly feel like a downgrade from previous titles medieval ii did it perfectly with multilayered citadels dedicated military settlements being entirely different than cities etc in this game theres multiple scenarios where you attack with a lord that just gets a free destroy castle wall button right at the beginning of the battle you should have an inherent strong advantage as a defender in a siege situation and this game just doesnt facilitate that at all

the largest issue this games suffers from which plagues essentially every game of the 4xrts genre by the way i just need to point it out here is difficulty scaling the ai is dumb want to make the game harder give them every cheat known to man stats wise the only thing ai really know how to do is attack move their entire army at you even on legendary they will regularly send full stacks to their death by initiating battles against you they dont even have any chance of winning and i dont just mean in battle by the way i mean the autoresolve will be an 8020 split in your favor and the ai still attack for some reason

the game is fun ill continue to experiment with mods and play with friends when they ask but when it comes down to it once you crack the formula theres really no situation where you havent really won the campaign by turn 5060 and would just continue it for the sake of reaching the tedious win conditions of a long victory which vary wildly wood elves and norsca were beyond annoying to complete whereas chaos dwarves i beat a legendary campaign as zhatan the black in 2 hours

the core gameplay loop sees you essentially solve the first 10 turn puzzle for each legendary lords start and once youre able to do that consistently that illusion of depth for the game shatters and youre left with a quick 30 minutes of conquering and then an end turn simulator as you sweep through the map

i do recommend this game the warhammer lore is one of my favorite universes and is done extreme justice here the game is definitely enjoyable up until the point that youve mastered it and youll get your moneys worth for that time however after that even with such a diverse cast its just boring due to the lack of actual challenge hitting start campaign feels meaningless in my opinion if you know theres no chance of actually losing

#####

lets be real for a second this game without any dlc or predecessors is not even half a total war game and the price you are asked to pay for the full experience is only stomachable if you bought the other stuff you want in it over the last years

the balancing is all over the place since ca ramped up the magic from i to ii to iii considerably and throws in elite units like its going out of style once youve met a half dead chaos army that still kicks ass because every single unit is a super elite unit youll know what i mean the difficulty setting essentially just beefs up the ai units to ridiculous levels and reduces their upkeep so a faction a tenth your size may field as many armies as you have legendary lords may have the most special of special effects  or a minor economy buff so if you meet one in battle be prepared for nasty surprises even just on hard difficulty ive seen the ai attacking me getting killed to the last zombie sylvania and both attacking armies were back to full strength with the lords i just put in the ground there may be some fuckery around

endgame scenarios follow the old caroute just throw a ton of elite fullstacks at the player because thats fun idk if it were an actual horde attack but the spawning of  for example 15 stacks of elite wood elves who just go on the rampage until you burn their stupid forest   is plainly creativly bankrupt

the design of minor villages is moronic in the extreme and mostly doesnt benefit the defender nearly as much as it should in the case of dwarfs humans and elfs who may have things like firing lanes and defensive positions in mind there are for example often courts which might concentrate the enemy by blocking off the exits but you cant put any ranged units in good firing positions around it 

sieges are still as stupid as they were in twwhi everybody has a ladder up his arse and walls are little more than death traps for your troops knocking down reenforced gates with clubs and fists takes about as much time as it takes a unit to leave the wall

im not saying im not having some fun in this game but it could be much better especially since its the third and final entry in the series so if you liked the other two twwhs and have all the dlc races you might want to play go ahead and buy it but if you are new to the whole twwh go get something else this game will annoy the hell outta you

#####

to say ca has had some troubling decision making is perhaps the understatement of the year

however i do genuinely believe this game business aside is well worth it especially if you have the first 2 games already
the diplomacy is a significant improvement with the ability to sell and buy cities being absolutely useful early on and into the mid game the races mostly are reasonably balanced with each other sorry kislev and ogres not you there is also a feature i consider significantly underrated and something i wish was in total war rome 2 and the like at times you can play coop with multiple people and all of your turns are done together huge quality of life improvement

dlc wise champions of chaos are okay chaos dwarfs are a fantastic addition ogre kingdoms are at least fun if undercooked and shadows of change well i guess they went back and added some value probably should get these dlc on sale though

its a 4 stars out of 5 type deal with the major issues being largely business related but i have hundreds of hours in at this point so its hard to say i havent had fun modding community is fantastic highly recommend things like legendary characters and the old world for some added fun

it just feels like the developers of this game try to balance around getting their feelings hurt watching youtubers break their game i have more than 1000 hours on total war warhammer 2 which i think is one of the best games of all time the balance changes they made here are just unfun honestly the enemies always just out of range always knowing when to take engagements and when not to the fact that the developers doubled down on the worst part of the game with the sieges even on normal difficulty the ai is too smart to ever assault a settlement where they arent 100 percent sure they will win as a result the entire game is just you sieging enemy cities aka the very worst part of the other total war warhammer games i dont know why they would lean into this terrible feature that everyone has hated for the better part of the past decade with these games furthermore changes to reinforcements ensure that you always take heavy losses even if you plan ahead there are less field battles than ever before i have 100 plus hours of trying to like this game and its honestly just not happening the developers need to stop taking legendoftotalwars videos personally and focus less on developing ai counters to cheese and more on just making the game fun

#####

the game is great

i kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points the following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam people do that to trick you into giving you steam points the steam currency by posting something to appeal to your human compassionate aspect thereby ripping you off because it is all  lies and deceit

i am a 52 year old father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is now 16 my son recently started total war warhammer iii and in less than a week he had already played for over 20 hours this was terrible for me as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on tiktok so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game did the tutorial but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought my son and i closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories

longtime warhammer fan over 500 hours in warhammer 2 about 50 hours in this game 
also 500 likes for this review thank you homies im so glad that i can help so many people decide if they want this game or not

abbreviated review

dont buy this game start with warhammer 2 with moral empires youll have a much more fun time especially if youre new to the series wh3 might have potential when mortal empires comes out for it but youll just be rebuying the other games so i find it hard to justify wh3 is buggy tedious and has a campaign design that in my opinion is designed to simply not be fun additonally wh3 is currently in its vanilla state at this time meaning that without a doubt dlc after dlc will be introduced to make this game that is currently a bit bland and unbalanced into a playable experiance if you do plan to buy this game be prepared to sink several hundred dollars in total to grab all its dlcs 


detailed review

wh3s main issue is its campaign that makes the game extremely unpleasant to play without exaggeration the second most blaring issue is that the game feels very unfinished barebones and unbalanced which is already paving the way for overpriced dlcs 

as for the storyline its bad but in a way you might not expect most games have a main quest but provide players the freedom to pursue it whenever they are ready or feel like it this is not the case with wh3 the main quest basically soaks up the entire experience which is starkly different from the other two entrees that allowed for a more sandboxempire building campaign which i think is what most people were expecting these sandbox elements of warhammer 3 are quite fun when you have the chance to play them but again the main quest line quite obtrusively prevents you from really enjoying this core of the game youre gunna get sick of this main questline very quickly 

basically spoilers ahead the game is a race to acquire four demon souls before the other factions you have very little capacity to stop the other factions and if you fall behind in this race theres a chance your ten hour campaign will all be for nothing several rifts into the chaos realms open up across your empire that you have to constantly close and use as teleporters to reach these demon souls where you have to fight a total of 5 quest battles each about one hour long ontop of dozens more within the realm of chaos extremely tedious

if you dont close these rifts they will spawn armies and spread corruption across your empire hence being an expansionist empire like how 90 of players want to play is highly discouraged because more lands equals more rifts perhaps youre beginning to see how many like myself accuse this main quest of being obnoxious 

the chaos realms themselves which is where you go when you enter the rifts are even worse especially the tzeench realm which in my opinion needs to be completely redone  basically you have to spend time in these four chaos realms to capture the demon soul where you have to fight dozens of repetitive battles and finally a long and tedious questsurvival battle where your whole army is likely to die 

the longer you spend in these chaos realms the more likely you are to acquire absolutely crippling weakness to your character thats essentially impossible to avoid based on how long you have to spend in the realms oh and by the way theres zero reward for completing a chaos realm and capturing a soul none you just get a soul which is one of four steps to get to the final battle which is its own can of worms 

why do you have to do all this like i said ive never seen a game that pressures the player to pursue the main quest more than wh3 if you dont do this the other factions will get the souls first and you lose are you like me and you just wanna build an empire at your own pace explore the map fight the factions and be a strategist sorry all that matters is the main quest line you absolutely must use your main lordarmy too when entering these rifts you cant send a second army to make it easier seriously idk what these developers were thinking i guess creatively assembly hates their fans perhaps the biggest slap in the face is that even after you beat the final battle more on that later the rifts keep opening lololol 

so if you get this game you can enjoy endless rifts that need closing tedious chaos quest battles and crippling character traits because you spent too much time in the chaos realm enjoy your anxietydriven easter egg hunt they call a campagin thats what i can tell you that you will get after playing this game for a total of about 50 hours on my two accounts 

dont even get me started on the final battle have fun playing an hour long battle just to lose at the very end after youve successfully defeated the main boss and have your whole army die by the endless enemy reinforcements in my game my lord bugged out too and wouldnt move during the final battle which is pretty shitty 

the game is buggy but not exceptionally buggy compared to other new releases final battle is a rage fest thats way too hard and takes too long to fight its very easy to exploit the thing to farm supplies and win that way which is arguably cheating but if you actually try to win the battle the way it was designed youre gunna be spending hours just to watch your grand army fade away even if you do win go ahead and bring a doom stack youll still have high casualties the final battle is one of five survival battles that are cool in theory but are like an hour long each and extremely costly i really respect the attempt making a challenging survival battle but it needs alot of work 

if someone makes a mod where you can just turn off the entire ursunmain quest entirely thatd be awesome and maybe id give it another try for now though i wouldnt advise you to get this game and thats coming from a major total war fan the story line absolutely blows is tedious and the new factions arent very remarkable to compensate they are quite unbalanced too lots and lots of dlcs will have to come out to make this game fun so thats why i would recommend war hammer 2 with moral empires on sale youll have an equally fun campaign experience without the most obnoxious and intrusive story line in the history of total war games 

to be fair its likely ca will address the trash storyline or someone will mod it to just disable these silly rifts perhaps then the game will feel less like a rectal thermometer to play the second of the two glaring issues i have with wh3 is the greedly dlc grab this game has potential but be prepared that to get the full experiance you will almost certianly have to drop hundreds of dollars into dlc 

currently theyre actually charging about 2 dollars for a dlc that enables blood and gore yep you just read that right the game has the word war in the title twice and the base game doesnt have any blood and gore not only that but theyre seriously charging their fans for a dlc in order to enable blood and gore 

theyre actually charging a dlc in order to access graphics i could certianly say more but i think you can make your own judgement on the moral charachter of ca and how they see their fans 

like most games these days unfortunately wh3 is in its bare bones vanilla state if you buy this game you will get access to 7 playable factions one of which is chaos undivided which is just a combinaiton of the others so really its only 6 i personally find this pretty light but its up to you if you think thats enough to justify a 60 dollar purchase also 57 of these factions are evil and not everyone likes to play as the baddies

thats just one guys thoughts you i hope you decide if this game is right for you

i bought all the dlcs for warhammer ii and all of the dlcs for warhammer iii except for the most recent one  warhammer was their golden goose that printed money for them and i spent hundreds of dollars on their games and dlcs  then creative assembly blew 100 million dollars developing a game that got cancelled before it could be released and now they expect warhammer fans to pay for it by hiking dlc prices significantly when i complained about it on the steam forums they banned me along with hundreds of other loyal fans who bought their games  

so im going to write my first review ever  im not going to support this company anymore their ceos have some sort of weird god complex thing where they think they can control negative criticism by banning people on steam forums or making fake copyright claims on youtubers who criticize them  if youre curious check out volound on youtube

#####

90 of my hours in this game is modding at the moment of review so i will just keep it short

dont buy it wait

it will be great in year or two

edit  112023
time passes review does not change

#####

disclaimer this review is based around week 1 impressions and may not be accurate moving forward as of july 2022 i have updated this review to fix some grammar and awkward sentences

its really kind of disappointing to see warhammer 3 in this state im not even going to lie i was absolutely expecting it to be like this before it was released ive been under the opinion that despite everyone saying theyve been working in this game for 5 years that theyd actually probably been working on it the past 2 years if even that 

where to begin

ub graphics bu
the graphics are a downgrade from what they were before at least in my opinion things kind of have a cartoony vibe to them instead of the gritty realism look from warhammer 2 which im not really a fan of if you look up warhammer 3 snow too bright youll see what it was like half of the time i fought a snow battle where the ground was basically highly reflective glass that blinded me the campaign map looks pretty good but i dont really understand why they took the approach of changing up the graphics from the second game to be clear this is a personal opinion

ub sieges bu
as a massive dwarf player from warhammer 1 and 2 i take it as a personal insult that with all these talks of siege reworks we still dont have the ability to effectively position gunpowder units on walls or that sallying out to defend the walls while ranged units pepper the opposition isnt a tactic instead they took a look at bloons tower defense and decided that itd be a great idea to incorporate a tower defense system instead of actually overhauling sieges at all im happy that a lot of sieges have bigger maps but the supply system feels like a massive gimmick to me we needed sieges to be redesigned from the ground up not the exact same with one new feature added minor sieges are basically just full on sieges now sure there are no walls but the same stupid tower defense game is available to the defender the minor sieges seem to offer superior defense to the main ones go listen to legendoftotalwar and other creators even they say that city sieges are more difficult than minor sieges now

ub dedicated daemonsbu
reworded july 2022 i have a gripe with the fact that chaos undivided has access to all daemon units i do not like that the only thing that makes the dedicated daemon factions unique are their faction effects and legendary lords 3 unique units for each dedicated faction would have sufficed and provided more incentive to anything besides undivided for more than a single run

ub unit pathing  responsiveness bu
unit pathing is absolutely horrible again as a dwarf player i love ranged units especially gunpowder units while this has been a problem in warhammer 2 on occasion in the past in warhammer 3 it is the worst it has ever been every single time you give ranged units an attack order they do a little dance without failure this is absolutely always the case imo one of the big reasons youll never see anyone utilize crane gunners iron hail gunners or streltsi is because they cannot reliably be attack ordered you are 100 better off just turning them and leaving them on fire at will and even then its a 5050 if they will shoot potentially fixed as of july 2022 couldnt tell ya

ub unit mass bu
unit mass is busted top tier cathay halberd infantry braced to take a charge from slaanesh horsies nope sorry the ai has the horses charge into and then pull through the infantry every time to hit your back line send out a terracotta sentinel beast to intercept a charging unit of daemonettes nope the middle of the unit gets knocked back the rest keep running like absolutely nothing just happened strikeagain right into your backline of crossbows strike i have 0 idea what they did involving unit mass but it needs to be tweaked substantially large entities just pass through crowds without contest when the ai is controlling them despite certain crowds being designed to take on large foes 

ub game ui bu
who was in charge of the ui its objectively a downgrade from warhammer 2 where before colors used to mean things now everything is red red red red red why why did they think it was a good idea to just obliterate faction unique ui and on top of it slap red onto literally everything else it just baffles me its like they thought if they didnt do it that everyone would call it an improved clone of warhammer 2 with new races spoiler which hilariously enough is what everyone wanted spoiler just another horrible design decision

ub the campaign bu
dont even get me started on the realm of chaos campaign jesus whoever thought this was a good idea is really helpless then again no big deal right just because all four chaos realms are literally no fun to interact with and they couldnt even bother making each boss of the realm look like a representative of their respective god doesnt mean you have to interact with that system right 

if you dont like it just have a great time exploring the new map declaring war on your neighbors subjugate your enemies just like the older titles too bad 10 poopy portals just opened up across your entire empire that corrupt your land and make everyone extremely unhappy unless you manually send armies or heroes to go close them armies fight a battle heroes use gold and better yet despite the campaign implying that your advisor is the only one capable of helping you enter these realms every other major faction can do it too what a coincidence now you have a time race so even if you dont want to explore this mechanic you have to because if you dont you will literally not be allowed to play the game if an ai reaches the end and you dont take the opportunity to fight them spoiler your campaign will literally be a loss and you will be unable to play any further spoiler to top it all off ai factions will almost never close these portals meaning that if you dont own entire provinces or you have an ally they might have daemon armies wandering around as they spawn from the portals yay i believe this has been addressed as of july

ub epilogue bu
honestly i could go on turn times not being improved nearly at all balancing being all over the place tiny rosters compared to previous releases the game is fun you probably wont regret your purchase if youre new to the franchise but honestly even with that i really cant justify telling anyone to buy this game when warhammer 2 exists like i just cant feasibly understand why anyone would want to play whatever this is when warhammer 2 is out and is just flat out better more interesting races a bigger and more diverse map a gigantic modding community 

so yeah is it the worst game ever no but if i could summarize it in a single word its disappointing im sad that i was right about this title being trash compared to the last im sad that they took all the advice and barely implemented any of the complaints that werent superficial and easy to do ie diplomacy did actually improve 

ubsummarybu
go buy warhammer 12  preferably on one of the many sales they have throughout the year if you are new to the franchise explore the races in the mortal empires gamemode in warhammer 2 and then pick up the dlc you find interesting when it goes on sale 

if youre bored to tears of warhammer 2 and want something new then buy warhammer 3 and enter it with low expectations get a lot of heroes so you can close the rifts when they open other than that the only reason i could possibly recommend for someone to get warhammer 3 is if they really love the daemons in the warhammer universe in that case you might enjoy this game a lot since daemons arent really utilized in the previous titles

see you guys when immortal empires comes out

#####

this game made me racist

#####

i put 1700 hours into wh2 and i just cant get into 3 there are things that are great like the improvements to diplomacy but overall i find actually playing the game outright unpleasant by far the biggest problem for me personally is the settlement battles these are a slog with endlessly respawning towers narrow streets that the games pathfinding is clearly not good enough to handle ai that has no idea how to actually fight the battles and battles that seem to drag on forever without much excitement turning minor settlement battles into siege battles has also had the effect of making field battles fairly rare and the latter are far more satisfying to fight this all has the effect of making me dread actually fighting battles in this game and given my dislike of the campaign and its mechanics this means theres little im actually enjoying while playing

the campaign took everything bad about the vortex campaign in 2 and doubled down on it all theres very little freedom in how you approach the campaigns and everything is on a timer the game penalizes you for expanding beyond a few small provinces the chaos realms are tedious to get through each with some gimmick that that just serves to slow the whole process down and which the ai can often bypass entirely the survival battles at the end of each realm are like siege battles but somehow even longer and less fun though mercifully you can autoresolve to skip them 

finally the army rosters are disappointing especially for the demon factions who not only share units between them but who also have fewer units in the first place than the other factions this compounds the problems with the battles by making them all feel very samey after a short while

as it is right now i cant really recommend it ive been lucky to avoid most of the bugs and performance issues other people are experiencing but even when its all working as it should whats here just isnt very compelling it feels very thin repetitive unpolished and at its worst just straight up boring wait until immortal empires or a couple dlc packs drop whats here right now just isnt worth your time or money though even then this game has issues that go beyond not just having enough content and i have doubts about the foundations of this game and its longterm quality i was not expecting to have

i have never played a game for so long and accomplish so little

this game is okay everything else you have chosen to do has not been i have thousands of hours in total war games the continual disrespect for your fanbasemarketbase is absurd i have faithfully paid full price for your games only for them to consistently be fixed by modders the 1212 attila mod beats anything yall could ever pay to make and its because they actually fkn care they did it for free you ask for 30 a fkn  a dlc including the dumb 3 blood and gore mod yall always rip us off on i bought the game i should get everything that comes with it its shameful what youve accomplished with this money bag ballsck of a company the guys making rome ii knew what they were doing so did the attila guys you stuck with the lazyeasy troy model for pharaoh that whole game shouldve  been a dlc i hate what you guys have become im not supporting it anymore

#####

skarbrand hates it inside skarbrand hates it outside skarbrand will stand in the doorway because he hates it slightly less

#####

by itself not really amazing if you have the other games with dlc you can enjoy the immortal empires campaign
the base campaign for this entry is boring and not very fun
i recommend waiting until you can pick it up for 50 off

#####

on its way to become a very good successor to warhammer 2

#####

the game looks beautiful graphically each race is very unique and has some great units and they are pretty much balanced maybe some are a bit more powerful but other than that its fine the soundtracks are amazing and maps look gorgeous and well detailed but because of the poor performance of the game it will not be as smooth as wh2 

there is a huge problem with a performance specially during campaign game play even with high end computers you will still struggle to get a good fps i have a high tier gaming pc and played a few custom games and had ultra size unit on high setting not ultra and the average fps i was getting was around 4060 fps which is quite a disaster for a game this expensive 

so the main complain is about performance of the game and some minor bugs which can be annoying for some people some times units during the game wont attacking each other and just standing looking around i did not see fighting animations between units like what we had in wh and wh2 when like big monsters fighting each other i hope they didnt remove it from the game otherwise it will be so sad the ui in this game has changed compare to last series and it got worse and more confusing from my perspective


menu of the game is confusing and not easy to deal with the minor settlement battles have been improved but there are still a few problems with siege battles like when you put the range units behind the wall they wont fire or they cant which makes no sense you have to make a small gap between the wall and units but then they will lose their protection advantage and will get targeted more easily i cant really comment on the  chaos of realm campaign just yet but i really feel its not that hard even on legendary i feel like its rushed and unfinished maybe the goal is to be quick and finish it quickly but not sure why exactly  



in conclusion this game is not bad in fact its fun but you gotta have high end build pc to enjoy it fully on higher graphic i hope they will fix it soon and not leave it like what it is or it will be another attila total war

#####

tldr  solid title still has a couple of issues but overall a huge improvement from tw  warhammer 2 one of the suits said a really foolish thing and the company vastly misallocated resources changing lanes trying to tap into a market they had no business being in which probably caused the issues on launch day id get this one on sale


h1 the ive got time review  h1

are the csuites running the company into the ground it would appear so but aside from valve itself there are few aaa gaming industry companies who are not doing the same in 2023 they sega andor ca were dazzled by how much cod and battlefield rake in and wanted a piece of that pie what they should have done with that 50 million is convince games workshop to let them make a nonlore related total war warhammer  unchained or whatever title but some sort of nod to the fan favorite and very entertaining unsets from mtg with
1 randomized maps with many different world gen protocols
2 no faction has any inherit disdain for any other faction 
3 random start spots with a function to let playersteams start close to one another if desired 

only just recently gotten tww3 and having been playing tww2 up until that day there are a lot of improvements still no move all units separate from end turn button like shogun 2 had 

pros   i can think of off the top of my head
simultaneous turns in multiplayer 1010
quick deals 1010
separate button appears when ally player sends you a deal 1010
being able to recruit allied factions units 1010
being able to just disable any notification you find annoying 1010
being able to move while in ambush stance 1010
ai doesnt spam underpassage 1010
different factions rise to great power 1010

gripes 
the little check box in the upper right of an armylords panel should be ignore this lords notifications as opposed to always show this lords notifications its really annoying having to garrison an army somewhere then every turn click through that notification because i want to know when my other lord stopped moving its just a bit backwards is all instead of making me click the disable notifications then any army i want to keep tabs on just let me click the army i want to ignore

as i said before there is still no move all heroeslords button i would like them to move before i end my turn not both at the same time

overall performance needs to be more polished lots of stutters midbattle and freezing issues from some we arent using some obscure hardware off of wish either we all have among the 10 most common gpus according to steams surveys also the host of games seems to load in last by about 30 to 60 seconds every time we load up the world map not sure what thats about


does my experience discount from the experiences many went through from launch day up until to a few months ago no games should be released in a far better state than this was should a csuite say the quiet part out loud also no we all know that if a company does not take in enough revenue the company dies it is up to that company to provide a product worth buying in the first place thats econ 100 stuff we are not just cash cows you milk when you want to buy another beach house or another fleet of super cars gaming for me seems to be turning from oh boy the new title came out its gonna be great to a somber i better wait a year or 2 for the game to be actually enjoyable

rocky start but im loving immortal empires

before you buy
the base game only includes a fraction of the available races unless you already own i or ii youre looking at an additional 60 purchase for something like greenskins or skaven other dlc floats around 25 each as if that isnt enough some lords are locked behind an additional paywall even if you own base dlcs to be clear all of this content is already installed and led by ai you just cant play them unless you get past the massive paywalls pretty gross

an ssd is highly recommended otherwise youre looking at stupid long load times

pros
very pretty good sound design
multiplayer works pretty smoothly
factions have great aesthetics and variety
unique play styles and mechanics for each faction
interesting army matchups abilities and battle maps
easy to get invested and spend hours playing

cons
devs are money grubbers  nesting dlcs
the ai is pretty dumb
pathing can be frustrating
not always balanced
the tooltips explain nothing big learning curve if youre new

i usually dont leave negative reviews on bad games but here i have to this is coming from someone who owns almost all the dlcs  tldr warhammer 2 was great warhammer 3 sucks  i wonder why that is  ca has to get out of the mentality that the players have no idea what theyre talking about because here they absolutely do  those same players have supported you through countless mistakes  if this was a relationship i would have gone on vacation with you and left you at the airport  im not sure exactly what happened at your company where in 2 years time you managed to take a gem of a game and pull a blizzard on it but you should probably at least try to listen to your playerbase to fix it  find some of the really simple fixes people are asking for and fix them  
you can start with not blackmailing your playerbase  
next come out with some good dlcs but be reasonable because your asking price is not reasonable and its everyone telling you that  so if the players are asking to go back to the wh2 prices figure out a way to do it  im not going to do it for you i have my own job  figure out a way to do it yourselves  thinking caps
after that please issue a no drugs at planning meetings edict because with this last dlc someones mixing heroine with carpet cleaner  and hes pouring it in the punch  perhaps something a bit more simple  no ones demanding space ships  and youll save some money making the dlcs to lower the costs for players to buy in
next you came out with all these evil factions and so few good factions  wtf  wh2 was nice and simple good vs evil  you get 2 evils and 2 goods  wh3 turns into post apocalyptic simulator  good vs evil vs really evil doesnt have a good ring to it
next the good factions cant really hang onto the bad faction territory because its unsuitable  if you come out with 9 evil factions to every 1 good faction whats the point of making the evil factions virtually unkillable   just look at kislev  supposed to be the bastion of the north  they get tucked in real tight every night by the many more evil factions all around them and kislev the ice people cant even take most of the ice cities due to unsuitable penalties  only if you give us money winky face
next bugs  i know you say youre on it but i feel like it has been a good bit of time now to resolve all the effects not effecting and armies getting stuck on terrain making them untargetable for future turns

lots of people want to see the game succeed  it shouldnt be the players that want the game to succeed more than ca  put some pride back in your stride


#####

i want so badly to be able to recommend this game but i simply cannot whoever is directing this latest trend with the total war franchise is milking the good reputation of the series for profit and eroding any good will their audience might have left over from the initial joy of seeing a game made with so much effort put into it 
leaving negative reviews is not enough if they are laughing all the way to the bank
one must simply stop buying products that are not worth the money 
go outside watch a film or play an old total war game instead i wont be buying the latest dlcs until ca is done milking this property and valve starts flogging them for 80 off and i suggest you do the same

#####

one step forward two steps back

the predecessor to this game total war warhammer ii is a masterpiece of a game that brought thousands of new players into the series it was very flawed in the early days but had the foundations you look for in a good strategy game engaging ai distinct identities between factions and interesting and engaging mechanics at the end of its lifespan the game had ironed out all of its issues except for three main issues the simplified and repetitive major settlement battles compared to historical titles in addition to a lack of minor settlement battles clunky simplified and unclear diplomatic mechanics and the base game campaign the vortex race was unfun and a complete mess total war warhammer iii was developed with the hope that all of these issues would be resolved

it was clear on launch that this would not be the case the developers learned nothing from their development of the race for the vortex and made a campaign that was somehow worse the realms of chaos removes agency from the player and gives them severe penalties for both engaging with and failing to engage with the mechanics the campaign was so bad that the top mod on the steam workshop for six months was a mod that removed the core mechanic entirely 

sieges did not fare much better the developers wanted survival battles with mobile tower defense game mechanics to be the central focus battles of the realms of chaos campaign and decided to port many of the same mechanics to sieges and minor settlement battles to make defending them more interesting the end result was that every settlement battle became a de facto siege battle and with the developers only creating one or two maps per race and the ai avoiding field battles players end up having most of their battles be these repetitive slow and punishing settlement battles

diplomacy definitely was improved coming into the third game in the trilogy but came with notable downsides confederation already difficult in total war warhammer ii became almost impossible due to the developers reworking the mechanic and disallowing the player from using gold to influence the other factions opinion this has actually influenced the way the ai operates in the campaign with many more factions but each faction remaining relatively small and insignificant relative to the player

immortal empires the combined map including territory and factions from all three games was supposed to fix most of the issues with the game what it did was highlight many of the issues that went unnoticed for the six months prior to it coming out the developers had made many changes to the game that powered down most factions in the game justifying it by powering down the ai factions as well how many game developers draw players in to their new games by removing features and powering down the player almost all game developers try adding more features in or changing the focus of the features to differentiate them from the old mechanics 

total war warhammer iii is a game that is not quite ready yet and might not be as good as its predecessor for a long time i cannot recommend it now to a new player but i might change my opinion in the future if the developers make changes to improve the game experience

#####

its a good game if you have a pc that can run it stably if not try warhammer 2 but you need to bare in mind the state it released in after the poor release i stopped following it but after about 9 months to a year after release was when it finally became a product that can be considered finished enough to sell 

aside from that they milk you dry with the dlcs and a lot of factions that arent dlc are diminished without them so it feels like they are taking advantage of you i buckled in the end and bought them all on sales and with keys to make it bearable which encourages them even more and it frustrates me but its hard not to thats why despite having 77 hours and likely hundreds more hours to come it really frustrates me to the point i must give it a negative review in hopes that it impacts them and they reduce dlc prices and release their products in a closertofinished state with more reasonable pricing you might say that when comparing price to hours played it is worth it but total war games are just extremely long and shouldnt be rated like that if you weigh the effort they put into the dlc it will become clearer

oh and the dlcs they release can be quite poor too in quality and quantity the most recent one has just got a new patch a few days ago which makes it barely worth it if you are comparing it to previous dlcs despite still being expensive

#####

after you pay 300 for the 1st and 2nd game and all of their dlc plus the dlc for this game then you can have fun and play

#####

overpriced dlc from a company that neglects their playerbase to the point they just started mass banning them telling them that the right to discuss is a privilege  it is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game

its really hard to recommend any game good or not when that is the wall you face going forward with this developer no remorse no attempts to course correct they only ever double down that they are right and every single other person ever is wrong

#####

def not as replayable as the 2nd game but hey your comparing it to a game that has had basically over 6 years of updates

some nice additions some less nicer ones to be completely honest i think the backlash this game still has is a bit misplaced

#####

this game is fantastic just needs to work on communication graphics map characters economy how the units aim realistic unit movement anti aliasing the ai diplomacy rational decision making by ai the hud the tutorial time to load synchronization the launcher understandability and getting a new developer team

did i mention its very affordable

#####

the right to a positive review is a privelege

they banned me from the forum for saying check yourself before you wreck yourself  

the reason  promoting self harm is not allowed on the steam forums

they have no idea how offensive and inappropriate this reaction is  what a joke of a company  the comment had nothing to do with self harm they just dont like criticism whatsoever and are willing to use shady offensive reasons to ban you

#####

cool game you have to play like at least 300 bucks to make it good 
 this game 3060
 first game 1560 
 second game 2060
 dlc for this game 153062635
 dlc for first game 399374
 dlc for second game 5690111
so in total 314896285 
then it gets even better when you add tax
so in total with a tax rate of 699 you get a total of 3369067243
finally you also have to get the free speech dlc 
what a great game just makes me want to get every dlc at full price i personally love spending every last dime on a game that has ground textures that compare to retail royale you would think they would put more effort in the ground textures seeing as that is all you look at besides the units this is like wart hunter war thunder and eu4 levels of dlc greed somewhat close to train sim levels of dlc greed with their 700 
in summary game cool bit hard to learn grim kleaper made me want it and now i am down 45 too much dlc cant play all the factions because they are locked behind a paywall bad pr and the sandbox is cool

#####

fun game cant wait for full release

#####

i finally had secured all of the empire under my banner and the vast nation of men towered as the strongest faction of the realm secured to the south by the treaties held with the various mighty dwarven kingdoms that stood between men and the undead to the west by the great ocean beyond which the proud elves mainly desired to be left to their own devices and to the east kislev the formidable ally to the empire stood guard against the orc threat thus i led the armies of men on a glorious campaign to battle the forces of chaos in the north that had been plaguing the realm with unrelenting incursions for as long as history had been written
how could i have even suspected that without the slightest hint of their betrayal the entirety of the dwarven tribes would suddenly unite and in the same breath declare all of mankind their enemy turn their combined armies around and start ever marching north with nothing to stop them but hastily erected voewfully inadequate walls manned by whatever had been deemed unfit to battle chaos

as the empire now lies in rubble with its remnants holding out on its few remaining islands the once glorious army of men being only a shadow of its former self let this be a cautionary tale to those of you who ever consider turning their backs on a dwarf

but then again i am immortal after all so dwarfen scum in this life or the next prepare to pay for the sins of your forefathers

#####

first of all if you enjoy strategy games fantasy games or warhammer or total war titles in general you are almost sure to enjoy this game too you can easily sink hundreds of hours into total war warhammer 3 especially if you buy the right additional content i have in all three games combined around 2000 hours myself

however i cannot with good conscience recommend this dumpster fire of a game unless you can find absolutely no other games to enjoy it is unfortunately rotten to its core and i dont see any way for the developers to fix it i sincerely hope future games will do a better job but this one does not deserve your time why you ask 

well both sides of the gameplay are just so glaringly inadequate first this game is all about capturing settlements with your armies that constitutes 90 of your campaign goals that is how you grow your empire and make more money etc so battles using said armies and for said settlements should probably be the best feature of the game right wrong some of the battles are so bad that even trying to write about them right now makes me furious the variety in battles is amazing but that causes the poorly programmed ai armies to flounder more often than not in field battles the enemy units will try to repeatedly get into new formations neither defending against your incursions nor advancing on you it is somehow less competent in higher battle difficulties once you get the hang of it more often than not you can destroy whole armies of elite troops with only a couple of units of your own 

as for the battles taking place in settlements i dont think i could do justice to how awful the ai becomes if you dont take my word for it i suggest you watch some gameplay online that demonstrates this debaucle there are plenty of such videos and streams the layout of the settlements also boggles the mind every infantry unit features magically appearing ladders aptly dubbed by the community butt ladders making the walls trivial the design of which are already pretty senseless by themselves inside the settlements you have fixed spots where you can build barricades and towers using some vague resource that you accumulate over time the location of those defenses can be absolutely insane like towers blocked by buildings on all sides rendering them useless the pathfinding would have been considered terrible even in a game 10 years old and the so called victory points  oh my god it is just so bad so bad even the simplest tower defense flash game has better design than these battles  which are not even supposed to be like tower defense battles they are supposed to reflect real siege battles in a reasonable fashion they just dont these battles were actually so badly received by the community that one update removed most settlement battles and replaced them with field battles 

the campaign management is also laughably stupid campaign in total war games has never been on par with other major turn based strategy titles like civilization of course because this series also supposed to feature amazing real time battles but in the warhammer series it is dumbed down lower than imaginable though some mechanics introduced in the overpriced paid dlcs are very interesting all the basic features are largely unimaginative and lazy call me crazy but i think such an essential part of a 60dollar strategy game should be at least halfway decent without having to pay for any additional content diplomacy is mostly a joke only one deal in a hundred that you make requires any strategical thinking it is admittedly better in tww3 than in tww1 and 2 but not because it is now of a higher quality but because you are now forced to waste less time on it thanks to quick diplomacy and autobalance options 

most of the races from the first and second games either have not had updates to adjust them to the third game or said updates do not function properly it is clear from the lackluster skill lines of older characters missing features in the mechanics incompatible and insufficient adjustments to the new diplomacy options and other interactions between factions etc that no real thought has been put into how these factions should play together in the new game it is like comparing a well made article of clothing to one with weird patches all over it you can clearly see that the patches dont belong which makes the cloting seem very cheap and unattractive not to mention that many of the updates the game receives just do not work there have been dozens of critical issues that the developers claimed to have fixed in a patch which turned out to be blatant lies like five times in a row i refuse to believe that they do any testing before releasing these updates and there remains a buttload of important problems that they are yet to even acknowledge 

again you will probably have fun in this game despite all these issues and more of course you will likely get bored and fatigued by your campaign by the mid game and either start a new campaign before you get to the good stuff or stop playing for a while that is what happens to most players

#####

time to change my review forgot about it

although lets be honest maybe i shouldnt change it

why was this game released as realms of chaos and not as immortal thrones will forever boggle my brain
these singleplayer storymodes are such a waste of developer time in general  i know people who played all teh way through all of them and they all hold the same opinion when asked  immortal empires is warhammer iii

sadly immortal empires doesnt come with any pregame customizations  you get the map as it is with a billion choices but always the same   want some randomness in your life you need to look for age of wonders 4 or civilizations  

total warhammer is a great game but when you hit start game it will always be the exact same map with the exact same setup and exact same predefined prejudices and situations  once you start playing the world takes on its own life yes  but not at the launch screen it sure doesnt

my wife said that if i get 50 likes on this comment she will play total war with me thanks

#####

hello this is my review for warhammer 3 as a veteran player with almost 5k hours in total war warhammer 2
i own warhammer 1 warhammer 2 and all of their respective dlc and i was very hype being honest with all of you i am utterly disappointed so if i do seem a bit biased please do forgive me for the anger

optimization
first let us begin with the game itself it is very poorly optimized and while i managed to get it to run i know many people who had issues and still have issues including crashes and performance lag horrid fps on both campaign map and battles if you expect to run this game on a semi average computer or anything less than a 6000 dollar pc at high or above settings i would recommend you do not buy this at all your computer cannot run it properly and you will suffer even on certain high end computers half the settings have to be tuned down to medium or low so your cpu does not set itself on fire

the ui
now to the game play ui is awful and really hard on the eyes red everywhere to top it off most faction mechanics tied to the ui have no warning meaning if you accidentally click on something for example summon disciple army for slaanesh well your screwed other than that the colors are just awful and really annoying to look you change some of them but it is still far from ideal and you will still have infinite red on screen that cannot be changed

the faction mechanics
the faction mechanics are fun but many of them are also bugged as hell for example cathay caravan events can lock and not trigger preventing you from playing the campaign anymore on legendary specially because the only fix is to reload last save

the campaign mechanic
then there is the rifts and chaos realm mechanic easily the worst out of all the mini campaigns for their games ca has done in years it is a frustrating mechanic that tortures you and forces you to play the faction in a way that is both repetitive and just plain wrong and if you refuse to play it well then the ai factions can just win ca has an eternal sickening obsession with forcing players to race the ai for their shitty story mode that literary no one cares about a repetitive bad unsatisfying story mode that gets old after 2 playthroughs refusal to play the rifts mechanics cost you the campaign you just lose there is no way around it unless you blitzkrieg every single other contender faction on the map 
it is a frustrating and poorly designed mechanic in a game where the ai can cheat for resources replenishment logistics and money in addition to having perfect auto resolve specially on higher difficulty you are forced to abandon all your campaign plans your cities and everything you have to try and race them to 4 annoying battles while dealing with realm of chaos mechanics each one worse than the other and you have to do this for every campaign meaning it gets repetitive very quickly you have to play exactly how mr developer wanted you to play and nothing else its just horrible there is zero fun factor to it and the campaign mechanic practically ruins the experience on its own

auto resolve
then there is the auto resolve i am so angry about this it is insane so first of all the auto resolve is  still borked and even the fixes that were implemented in late warhammer 2 are not applied to it in addition ranged units and hybrid units are still way too strong in ar so these issues still persist and in their eternal genius the dev team decided that difficulty should effect auto resolve massively for no reason i will now give you a brief history lesson on total war games and their auto resolve many years ago during the age of shogun and rome 1 and many other older games the auto resolve used to be effected by difficulty your auto resolve was worse ai auto resolve for main factions was infinitely better this was as learned by the developers back then an awful experience it was tedious frustrating a cause for anger and ridicule because your 20 stack of rank 9 veteran units with buffs with technologies and much else could end up taking 900 casualties sometimes even losing units to a dumb garrison of 5 or less units just because so when rome 2 released and when attila released and when napoleons came out many of these games had that mechanic removed in order to make auto resolve less tedious and frustrating 
skip to the present day and after all the arguments after the knowledge and understanding gained from years of experience some genius decides you know what would be a good idea to make difficulty effect auto resolve just like the old days
i have no words to describe the sheer stupidity in this decision i have seen screenshots of an army that i know can beat up to 4 daemon armies on the field saying crushing defeat all because of difficulty i have seen an army composed of 3 units kill 1000 cathayen jade warriors it is insanity why they decided to change it back is beyond me but they did

conclusion
i cannot in any way shape or form reccomend this game in its current state and frankly speaking i am considering uninstalling and going back to warhammer 2 at least in warhammer 2 i still have some cool mods i can use to refresh my experience and i have my sandbox campaign 
all in all i consider warhammer 3 a catastrophic failure in design and in gameplay not to mention it is released effectively as an early access game that costs 60 bucks if you really want it i would say wait until the game is down to 30 or 20 bucks at least this is not worth it

#####

total war warhammer 3 is the gaming equivalent of game of thrones season 8

#####

i havent been this disappointed in a long time total war warhammer 3 was my beacon of hope for quality gaming this year but it quickly became my biggest letdown a strategic coup by creative assembly this game feels like less of a game and more of a gateway to an onslaught of excessively priced dlcs

sitting before this glossy façade i realize ive been taken for a fool  the gaming landscape is barren unless youre willing to continuously pay hefty prices for the extra content akin to holding your game hostage

cas pr team then has the audacity to preach that the right to discuss is a privilege demonstrating a complete lack of respect for their community an absolute disregard of us the loyalists who helped to build the very foundation theyre choosing to shake this was a rude awakening that auspicious reviews and sales are privileges that require the duty of respect towards the customers and delivery of quality products  principles ca seems to have forgotten

being a total war devotee for as long as i can remember its disheartening to see ca turning the franchise into another object of corporate exploitation reminiscent of games workshops methodology nostalgia in this case is a weak defense against such a despairing reality

towards creative assembly and sega  goodbye and no thank you a bond forged in the genesis era has now been severed the marriage of outrageously expensive dlcs and a tonedeaf pr move are the final nails in your coffin for our relationship

if this was merely an economic debate and ca had shown a shred of humility things could have been different but the condescending comments towards the players reek of arrogance solidifying their journey on the path of corporate deterioration

its like witnessing a titan fall  sega and ca giants of gaming reduced to shadows of their former selves joining the disdainful annals alongside bethesda and blizzard as a form of protest ive resorted back to rome 2 total war heavily modded to recapture the old magic  a magic thats now buried deep under layers of greed and entitlement

consider this a warning to my fellow gamers lets make a stand and not finance any more oblivious downfall for earning the privilege of sales and positive reviews sega and ca must first learn to value their greatest asset  us the community

#####

to preface i put 2000 hours into warhammer 2 it really is my favorite game on pc and feels like a complete package even before you factor in the frankly ludicrous amount of dlc that creative assembly hurls at the consumer in the early days of tww2s life cycle it was a little shaky and buggy but those problems got ironed out within the first year of the games release

we are almost one full year into tww3s launch and it has been turbulent at best and a nightmare at worst im not going to discuss realms of chaos because everyone else here already has but in short its very bad
instead im going to talk about immortal empires and for how the player is essentially punished for playing the game the way it is intended to be played

one of the things about total war is that usually throughout a campaign you create an empire you build wide not tall save for a few specific factions like wood elves or now warriors of chaos in order to build wide you need to capture settlements in order to capture settlements you need to engage in settlement battles which are by in large the worst addition to the franchise the cobbled together mess that is siege mechanics in this game make for an unenjoyable experience for both attacking and defending attacking because you are forced to take attritional damage from the computerlevel micromanagement throughout the entire fight no matter how superior a force you have due to ever present siege towers that you as a player couldnt possibly afford to have at that point in a battle as defender you have to wait until you have enough supplies before you yourself can build those same siege towers to defend while the ai barrels towards you at a speed that you cant possibly hold out until they arrive both sides attacking and defending are forced to deal with the abysmal pathing of your units that will charge 120 entity units into a single file line right into units that are braced and pick them off one by one despite you giving an order to not go anywhere but a straight line in tww2 the settlement battles that defaulted to open field battles were prime and if they really wanted to incorporate some form of buildings into their siege battles they could literally take inspiration from older total war games such as attila or rome where defending and attacking settlements was both fun and felt rewarding

actual proper city sieges are slightly less annoying because theyre walled cities it makes sense for the city to be fortified and have defenses put in place but the battles suffer many of the same problems that settlement sieges do in that pathing is horrible attacking is an attrition contest and defending is just giving away parts of your city in order to bank enough supply points to build a hot zone inside the city it makes zero logical sense that the optimal defense strategy is to completely abandon your walls as you will never win on them

diplomacy has been improved greatly in this game giving you the ability to threaten factions despite this rarely working to gain treaties or payments and more notably the abilities to not only trade territory finally and the ability to have meaningful alliances with the use of the military coordination mechanic that being said confederation is now almost obsolete as an option factions even if you control several provinces have the largest standing military and have thrown gold at joined wars with or even been allied to or traded with your suitable confederation targets will refuse to join your faction this is especially annoying for when you are trying to confederate factions that contain legendary lords you may want during your campaign i admit it was too easy in tww2 with you just being able to shower your kin in gold in order to submit their autonomy but in 3 they will only join you if they are on their last settlement that is currently under siege with no standing military force to resist their enemies

the endgame scenarios for tww3 are an interesting concept on paper but in practice are just what flavor of armies do you want to fight for the remainder of your campaign most of the endgame scenarios just spawn limitless amounts of armies of whatever faction gets picked until you destroy all the related factions major factions ie destroy all major vampire counts factions for their scenario all major dwarf factions for theirs etc i also wish there was still a mass chaos invasion option as the chaos invasion in tww1 and tww2 was really fun especially with tww2s method of being able to crank the difficulty of the invasion itself it really could become a massive doomsday event where chaos engulfs the world but the scenarios in tww3 just do not fill the same niche

even though i rated the game as a negative review i do like the game quite a bit but in its current state it is just not where it needs to be in order for the game to be considered complete we are almost a full year into the games life and only just recently did we even receive immortal empires a feat that the second game achieved in a month

#####

this game is a lifesaver having recently purchased a house that does not easily accommodate the space needed for a game of age of sigmar or 40k and having small children that will express their curiosity towards my ineptly painted models with reckless abandon weve played an obscene amount of this instead its not perfect but its tons of fun and allows for a impressive variety of play given how dissimilar the factions are from each other immortal empires really shows this off as does our favorite activity battle modes with points determining the army lists

i consider this to be the ultimate fusion of total war as a franchise and warhammer as a franchise and i would be hardpressed to name a strategy game i enjoy more as these two seem to be made for each other the grit and variety of the warhammer setting bringing a plethora of unit options over the typical total war pc game and the focus and grand scale of the total war skin really hones in on the best aspects of the tabletop version of warhammer the lore and the depth of faction options

you can distill the essence of this game to the following quote from one of my partners favorite robot chicken skits i beat up the guy who owned this stuff so now its mine thats called igeopoliticsi

wait till mortal empire and mods support

update after im release 
if you followed me previous advice youre wasted time

#####

after a very shaky start tww3 is almost where it needs to be a few bugs remain but they arent as critical as the ones that have been fixed and i have faith they will be in time too im having a blast on the immortal empires map

yea i know ca sucks 
yea i know it could be better
but still best total war fantasy to this date

#####

really cant recommend it at this point wish i could though 

the minor settlement battles are absolute slogs that are fun about twice before it becomes apparent that theyre tougher than walled settlement battles the ai forces them constantly you basically never fight field battles anymore in mortal empires

the portals are unfun gimicky and not well thought out

the ai instantly knows where artillery and spells are firing the second theyre firedcast and instantly dodges it makes mortars and vortex spells useless until you have fully engaged so unless youre skaven no effective value for you 

ai focuses on sniping units rather than winning which wouldnt be totally off putting if it werent for its computer level micro 

the ai is written to target you above all else allies as well refuse to confederate except under extreme conditions 

overall the game screams of a development team pushing a beta out with cheap cheaty ai fixes and poorly put together gameplay concepts to meet a too early release deadline 

ill be playing warhammer ii with mods till its fixed

the right to a positive review is a privilegeit is not an entitlement you earn by making a game

warhammer fantasy is better than age of sigmar

#####

the state the game is currently in is wonky
i dont understand how the team that built this game didnt just build from warhammer 2 i have hundreds of hours in that game but something just feels off with this game

and its not the trash ass campaign designed by the same dude who designed vortex and clearly doesnt take any criticism

#####

ca has made an amazing game with tww iii is it perfect no couldve it been perfect on release doubtful considering the fanbase all want something else some want the traditional sandbox others want a more change of pace

this game is def a change of pace when you compare it with the traditional sandbox style of total war games theres a rush element to the single player campaign and it is unforgiving if you fall too much behind others with collecting souls you need 4 of them to unlock a final battle as does the ai youre not going to win the campaign not matter what you do not because it is hard but because the mechanics simply wont allow you 

to me this was a good thing ive played a lot of warhammer 2 pretty much all of it mortal empires the combined map and races from both the first and second warhammer game i kinda grew tired of the mortal empires campaign during the end of the lifespan of wh2 because it was always just empire expansion the current campaign in wh3 is the exact opposite your goal is not to expand its to focus on the main objective and while doing that defend the few cities or provinces you have the more you expand the more it will bite you in the bum its quite different from previous total war games and i love it mind you if you just want to casually expand your empire at your own pace you will hate the campaign in this case it might be better to wait for the new world map that will be released in the hopefully near future 

because of the not expanding too much i felt a lot more connected to the few regions i did have the downside is that you wont see much of the map because theres no point to traveling much however if you do beat the campaign you are free to continue the same campaign and the rush element will be completely over that is where i am now in my current kislev campaign i completed it on hard campaign difficulty with normal battle difficulty it took me two tries i didnt finish my first kislev campaign due to mistakes i made i learned from them and my second campaign went a lot more smooth and thus was also a lot more fun 

so yeah the campaign will be divisive 

what about the graphics i play on maxed out settings with a 4k resolution same as i did with warhammer ii regarding battles the game looks so much better than wh ii it actually suprised me theres a lot more detail to the unit models and animations and all the maps looks so much better the maps in the chaos realms are the best looking maps ever created for a total war game in my opinion 

the campaign map looks a bit more odd though it looks better theres no question about that but i do not like all design choices the campaign map in wh ii felt more realistic a guess a bit grittier also the vampire counts are my favourite faction and colouring the map with vampire corruption looked amazing in wh ii here however the vampiric corruption looks plain and boring it doesnt stand out at all its a minor issue but noticable to me because i played the vampires so much and came to love what their territories looked like on the map guess itll take time getting used to all other campaign elements besides the trees which look kinda weird all look amazing kislev in particular also looks great with all the snow and ice elements 

battles are fun though there are the usual pathfinding issues i also had problems with units sometimes not really following orders or disengaging enemies no not due to my units on the so called guard mode setting but they are minor issues and will probably be fixed soon its not hampering my enjoyment at all i do dislike the tower building aspect of sieges and minor settlement battles though even when you destroy their towers using your archers or artillery they can rebuild them live during the combat it feels way too arcedy and its probably my biggest issue with the current game nothing that patches or mods cant fix though

sound design having only played kislev so far amazing looking factions and boy their spells look so good units too i love the music it really sets the mood battle sounds are good too though i do feel guns and cannons do need a bit more punch they should be loud when zoomed in and really pop but unfortunately its kinda lackluster i felt the same with wh ii though other sounds like unit screams units themselves etc are all fine oh they are tiny general speeches after you start the battle i love them takes me back to medieval 2 

lastly the performance ill keep this brief i had no issues during battles the framerate was good even on the highest settings my setup might have helped with that though eg gsync etc the campaign performance is a different story its so much more demanding than the warhammer ii campaign map it looks beautiful and i guess that comes with a price less performance its not affecting my enjoyment really but it sure is a big difference with warhammer 2 campaign map which was so smooth ive read that other areas than kislev might be less demanding though to be clear the performance isnt bad its just not as good as wh 2
crashes had three though in all occasions i did alttab every now and then all were on the campaign map for no particular reason repeating the same order on the map didnt make the game crash again ive been through worse with total war games

so yeah theres that an amazing game with lots of variety plenty of factions to choose from great and improved graphics good performance on my end and fun battles on great maps the campaign will be divisive its a rushing mode and not everyone will like that which is fine but it doesnt mean the game is bad ratings are always a bit hard to give but id rate the current game a 910

#####

im a big fan of the total war series and the warhammer games but i cant recommend the game in its current state 

the prologues storytelling is incredible but if you already know how to play the game you miss out on one of the best total war cinematic stories ive seen and get thrust into the main campaign which does an ok job but definitely doesnt compare to the prologue 

the gameplay loop has been changed around siege battles and in my opinion for the worse the addition of attila style defenses to minor settlements was a cool idea in theory but being able to actively place them in the middle of combat breaks the ai pathfinding and largely makes these battles unenjoyable i havent even gotten to defend with these new features yet because the ai never attacks me anyways unless its a doomstack vs the basic garrison so only the ai benefits from the new gameplay change when attacking its even worse i will get my army to destroy a barricade or tower just for it to immediately queue up another one in 2 minutes the only solution is to quickly break a barricade then blob your forces through the chokepoint before it gets built again all while taking constant turret attrition from the ai which also doesnt seem cheeseable with heroes juking the projectiles like in previous titles either the other solution is to cheese cavalry around the flank and capture the points behind the ai blob to destroy the turrets and win the battle that way so most of the minor settlement battles turn into autoresolves because i dont enjoy watching my tier 2 units get fatigued and ripped apart by the defenses and basic marauder spearmen

one personal gripe but as the starter faction khislev is really underwhelming for me their tech tree is a jumbled mess of random technologies that all add random buffs to random units but not in any order that makes sense in the early game i want to buff my kossars but theres only 2 techs that do that melee defense and ammoreload meanwhile immediately you have access to a tech that improves snow leapord units which you cant even recruit for about 20 turns or so and only start with one when playing a specific starter lord trying to navigate the trees and find a good path that fits my playstyle is nearimpossible for me plus their unit roster feels off their tier 2 units feel weaker than the regular kossars you get and the fact that everyone is a hybrid of everything isnt satisfying to me

the campaign pacing seems unnecessarily rushed in wh2 you could ignore the main quest and go at your own pace due to being able to send incursions to stop your rivals both leading up to and at the final battle to win thus you could expand and sandbox the way you want to and do the story once youve built yourself up in this game the campaign seems built around discouraging the total war expansion style of gameplay expanding too fast weakens your empire to chaos gate incursions but turtling and not expanding and fighting enough lets the ai get ahead of you in the quest to get souls 

of all the warhammer games to cut blood and gore out for a dlc this one is the most egregious you can play as a servant of khorne on maps that have 50ft blood fountains rivers of blood skull mountains nurgle soldiers literally pooping units to death and the debauchery of slaanesh all in the base game already but heaven forbid my units draw a little blood when attacking other units it makes the combat look floaty when you zoom in and instead of getting gristly fantasy action that feels impactful units will fly back and die with 0 feedback seemingly at random its blatant cut content for the sake of selling it in a dlc

some of the ui changes make no sense but luckily most of them are changeable in the settings if you dont like them the only major complaint is the obsession with making everything red im unable to really at a glance tell the difference between a building im building and a building im demolishing because theyre both the same hourglass color with one minor ui tweak next to it

in terms of graphics the game looks like a weird mesh between the realism of warhammer 2 and the fantasy style of three kingdoms and it doesnt mesh well with the serious tone of the story and campaign doesnt matter to me a lot though since i normally run it on medium graphics anyways but the performance is significantly worse this time around on the same settings as previous titles 

all in all its an ok game buggy yes but nothing gamebreaking in my playthroughs but of the three warhammer games its definitely my least favorite obviously when they add this roster and map to mortal empires most of those grievances will go away because i wont have to play around the chaos gameplay loop or soulfetching quests but other than trying things out and learning how the factions play i dont see myself devoting half the total hours to this game as i did wh2 or wh1

#####

game launched in a state it definitely shouldnt have launched in but the devs have worked their ass off in my opinion this right now is the ultimate total war experience the incredible size of the world variety in rosters and supersatisfying battling makes it really hard to imagine i can ever go back to a historical title i say this as someone with many hundred hours in multiple historical total war games

#####

slay anything without a beard

#####

tldr at this point 3 months since launch the game is in an abysmal state albeit with a pretty coat of paint especially compared to total war warhammer 2 it is not enjoyablefun in its current state and not worth your time and money 

if youre a new player looking for an enjoyable total war andor warhammer experience go tw warhammer 2 youll be much happier with the experience at the time of this review i have over 1200 hours on wh2 whereas i have no need nor desire to spend another minute past my paltry 319 hours on wh3 

if youve played the previous tw warhammers and have been holding off on 3 due to how mixed the community is on it i urge you to wait even if it is on sale as significant work needs to be done to even get this game even remotely close to the experience delivered by its predecessors unfortunately we are at a phase where the developing organization needs to see that things need to change to rekindle support and waiting will help accomplish that 

my complete review for those who are interested

preface just to make sure that i was fairly and accurately presenting my thoughts and comments in this review i did jump back in to wh3 for nearly 55 more hours today in a cathay campaign before writing to see what the current state of play was like and also gave the official road map from 04292022 another read over

as i partially mentioned above ive put a substantial number of hours into the past two total war warhammer titles 1200 in 2 and nearly 550 in 1 yet have no desire to play this game further i have finished a khorne faction campaign and have an unfinished ogre campaign that is likely already unplayable due to updates this is a major disappointment leading to finally motivating me to write my first game review after 6 years with steam as tw wh3 was the first game ive preordered in a very long time due to the large amount of trust i had in the franchise after many years of not only producing generally solid games but also the fact that they have had a steady increase of the overall quality of the additional content released postlaunch my last remaining hope for an enjoyable wh3 experience is a no mans skyesque comeback hopefully taking reviews such as this one to heart by the tw wh3 team if not at least i can help people avoid wasting their money or time on the game if such a comeback never occurs 

since there is a lot to go over i have broken apart the rest of this review into several different specific areas feel free to or not to read in whichever order that is preferable to you

problems that should have been but were not addressedfixed via updates per the official roadmap from 04292022 wh3

i am addressing these because i firmly believe that if you say you are going to do something then do it or in this case fix something then fix it and i think its important to hold the tw team accountable to what they say they are going to do i cant speak on every listed item from the roadmap but i believe that the ones i do include already represent an egregious failure to significantly improve the things they said they would 

issues when flying units attack ground units 
 this was still an issue for me i flew a dragon transformed leader into a group of squishyweak ranged units and after i noticed the ai moving some spearmen to intercept tried to fly her out of there to no avail instead getting bogged down by the bowmen and the chosen pathing of my leader instead moving them towards the spearmen 

autoresolve improvements
 100 not improved in my opinion and if it is not in an even remotely significant way in order to viably make good progress on a mere normal difficulty start i had to fight every single battle manually regardless of advantage as the autoresolve system just cut through my troops like a hot knife through butter 

improvements to unit responsiveness
 just like autoresolve if this was improved it was not doneso significantly i still had units get stuck on the corners of buildings and had significant issues getting units to attack units on one side or the other of barricadessometimes with them not moving at all from their initial position even when an easily accessible route was available apparently per their developer diary this will be further addressed in update 13but im not holding my breath 

improvements to singleentity units dueling with other singleentity units
 trying to get a leader to effectively engage with another was still very problematic for me they often got distracted with other units andor didnt pursue effectively 

early stages compared with wh2

i think it is fair to compare wh3 to wh2 especially because wh2 was released in 2017 and a substantialenough amount of time has passed that should have made wh3s release progress just as good if not better than wh2s which instead failed miserably 

blood dlc
this is my biggest content is missing complaint blood released for wh2 less than a month from release yet per their roadmap it should come sometime in july  september for wh3 this is flatout ridiculous especially given that wh3 generally has even more mature thematic elements than either of its predecessors looking at you slaanesh although this may seem like a minor detail to some it does add a level of quality that i would have expected sooner from wh3 it is utterly cringeworthy to hear blood for the blood god without a speck of blood being visibly spilt

mortal empires wh2 vs immortal empires wh3
i get that this expansive of a campaign has a lot of moving partsbut mortal empires released at the same time as the blood pack for wh2 literally the same day yet we are still awaiting the immortal empires campaign in august an evenso it is being released as a beta facepalm 

first dlclord pack not including the ones included at launch
wh2 cranked out its first lord packpaid dlc 4 months after release per the roadmap for wh3 we are supposed to see this happen july  september as well assuming it will be later given that it is listed with update 20 and update 13 is just finally happening 06302022  timeline isnt the issue here what is a problem is that they are trying to sell us paid content before they have even fixed the poorly done release that has had significant qol issues still persisting into the current state of the game fix the game first guys then worry about getting some more  from us 

edited to remove additional comments i wasnt expecting so many helpful ratings and greatly appreciate the many thumbs up and awards thank you unfortunately the increased attention has brought about many uncivil comments and im a bit tired of them at this point so im removing comments altogether at the end of the day this is my opinion and if yours differs thats perfectly fine i probably will dive back in after some more things have been ironed out and update this review accordingly however with reading the latest and planned updates that may not be for a little while cheers folks and happy gaming

#####

i love total war games and im an even bigger fan of the warhammer series this game functionally isnt very different from warhammer 2 but with tons of news races and some new mechanics it gives a new feel and a new way to play the best part is the more than 2 player multiplayer campaign which allows you to play with all your other friends in a big map but this is where i hate the money hungry decisions being made because you need warhammer 1 2 and 3 in order to play 
mortal empires which is the premier gamemode and the one where you can have the most fun with your friends i already paid 60 for a game and i even own the others but the fact that you need to dish out another 5080depending on when you buy them in order to use a part of the game that should just fucking come with it ruins it

#####

exellent game

very bad executives like a lot of big compagnies video game are not spared by ultra capitalism

#####

an incredibly accurate representation of the tabletop game if you want the games workshop experience in a video game nothing beats it
overpriced check
riddled woth balance issues check
filled with technical issues and gameplay features that are clunky or dont really work well check
devs dont really bother trying to fix them and if they do it just breaks other things double check 
and if you complain about these things the people in charge just ignore you and keep doing it anyway big ole check
really its impressive how commited ca are to emulating the warhammer experience

#####

a solid 75 as a stand alone game id recommend waiting on a franchise sale personally the base game has limited factions  the campaign is not great for replay value though has a solid story if you have the previous games  access to the immortal empires campaign the game is 1010 easily the best strategy game ive played since growing up playing lotr bfmii

shines most with friends where any combination of faction is allowed nay encouraged dwarf  elf alliance sure makes enough sense watching khorne troops break through enemy lines shouting skulls for the skull throne whilst supported by empire steam tanks priceless

on the support side of things the game receives regular patches  balance changes which do much to keep it fresh

edit the immortal empires campaign is now playable for everyone who owns the base game you are now free to fight againstally with all the other factions on the sandbox campaign map the series is known for

i would still recommend waiting for a good steam sale to pick up any factions you want however it is easier to find the ones you would like now that you can see them in action andor take their skulls for khorne

finally it has been brought to my attention that this review could be misconstrued as containing a prokhorne bias the bloodletter that i have retained as my legal counsel has advised me to dismiss these allegations out of hand as mere khornephobia a regrettable symbol of these trying times

#####

dont listen when it recommends the chaos undivided everyone will gang up on you turn 5

#####

i am a 55 year old biker and trucker father and probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is 14 now my son got this game for from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that the fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories

#####

this is a really good game  the only real issue that is setting people off is money

yes the game is basically twwh2 updated a bit and expanded  yes the dlcs are shameless cash grabs  yes yes yesall true  

but put things in context  i paid about 100 including the game dlc and miscellaneous whatnot for a game that i spent 980 hours playing and mostly enjoying thoroughly  thats about 010 an hour  its hard to feel ripped off at 010 an hour 

though im still not going to buy that last dlc

#####

legendary  very hard player 700h of play on #3 and 2200h on all total war warhammer combined
here is my opinion 

 wealth of content with the 3 games and the updates  dlc its really very impressive
 visual
 sound
 respect for the license warhammer is too vast and rich to be represented with 100 accuracy but we feel that we are in this world and that it is respected
 overall game playfeeling very nice overall but there are negatives about it too
 replayability infinite
 coop
 updates frequent  dlc not excessive for the work done in my eyes
 balancing its never perfect but its good
 difficulty adjustable but there are also negatives about this
 affordable by new players compared to old total war
 incredible and very numerous mods on the steam workshop
 really different factions lords to play as well you can have lords with an easy level of difficulty and another from the same faction which will be very difficult etc
 diplomacy is not the priority of the game but i find that the system has become more interesting and better balanced

 it takes all 3 games to really enjoy this monster my opinion would be entirely different without this condition its a hell of an investment but its worth it wait for a sale and presto but just #3 no i would find that really too bad
 siege battles are better than before but still laborious i find there are possible improvements here
 some annoying game play  feeling elements hit box in cities for example glue  weight effect on some units that fail to leave a close combat
 lack of clear explanations of how certain stats and game mechanics work a kind of irrelevant or clumsy old school roughness
 higher difficulties which do not offer an obvious improvement to the artificial intelligence but which apply bonuses to it and which apply penalties to the player not incredible as a feeling even if with the right settings yes the challenge is there i was hoping for better shall we say
 you need a fairly good pc to enjoy the game but hey its still normal given the number of units on the screen etc
 when the number of different factions during a game decreases the passage of a turn still becomes quite long

nothing is perfect obviously i think the negative reviews for a game of this magnitude and overall quality may be a bit lacking in nuance
i highly recommend this game but with #1  #2  #3

#####

i just realized i fell into a similar trap when making fun of the sims 4 pricing policy the only difference is that you can declare war on your annoying neighbors in this one

oyun çok güzel şahane ama 600 lira ne yaptınız abi siz neyin kafasını yaşıyorsunuz  tayyip bile bu kadar zam yapmıyor ülkemizdeki şeylere warhammer serisinin sıkı sıkıya fanı olarak her dlcyi daha önce almış biri olarak yazıyorum fiyatlar insani değerlere çekilene kadar artık almayacağım ve incelememi pozitife çekmeyeceğim

bu oyun size pahali mi geldi  erdoğan sayesinde oy verirken aklinizda bulunsun

sırf erdoğanda değilmiş sega aç gözlü bir canavar son çıkan dlc nin fiyatına bakın allah aşkına sega nın hiç bir oyununu almayın

english version please read and support

before starting i am huge fan of this game series i bought warhammer 1 and 2 with all dlc contents with my eyes closed this game series is my most favorite game series keep it on mind before read

sega declared war on turkish players first the game price was 345 tl still it was too expensive but some of us could afford the price and managed buy the game but now price is increased to 600 tl this is insane we already barely afford the cost but now  i cannot buy any of coming content anymore and it is just not me almost all turkish players have same situation average salary on turkey is 4500 tl this salary is already garbage according to our neccessary expenses game price is 600 tl now this is unacceptable even our insane president is not making this kind of price increases on turkey but sega did congratulations sega you are more insane and stingy then our goverment 

please decrease prices to what we can afford if you dont no one in turkey can buy the game or its content anymore if that is what you want you wont make any money from turkey

note  tl is shortening of turkish lira

is this game expensive for you  because of erdogan keep this in mind when you vote

i was wrong a bit  totaly not because of erdogan regime it is sega greedy for the gods sake look at this last dlc price and its content sega is a monster dont buy any sega  titled game

#####

if you absolutely love war death destruction and immersion this game is great if youre looking for an affordable and balanced masterpiece unfortunately you wont find it here

#####

after update 30 i cant recommend tww3 anymore immortal empires needs a huge amount of polishing and bug fixes and ca have been on a good course last autumn with patches 2123 we need patches of this quality every 12 months in order to get immortal empires up to speed instead we have had 6 months of radio silence with the hilarious exception being the removal of the betatag from immortal empires

along comes update 30 and oh boy not only is it severely lacking the usual flc content  a lord and some sort of rework or major polishing but 30 is so broken it sends the quality of immortal empires back to pre21 things that have been working perfectly fine before  skills performance abilities are broken and the battle ai is the worst its been in the entire warhammer trilogy this game needs several hotfixes along with big patches in the coming months

ca and sega really need to get their shit together and have more regular communicaiton and polishing that is not tied to new content until then this review stays even though i love this trilogy and will continue playing it

#####

i want to recommend this game i do  i enjoyed wh2 a lot and have some fun moments in wh3 but there are just stupid problems in this game considering it is a direct successor to wh2 and design choices that are just not good

there are still bugs in the game well over a year after release ranged units have a hard time firing at targets correctly armies can get stuck on agents and be frozen indefinitely random crashes can happen in battle maps several unit descriptions just dont even match what they actually doare functionally

the ai are brain dead during sieges and holy shit i think the main settlement sieges are the worst in any total war game since empire the defender is actually worse off than the attacker with the new capture point system defenses dont work all that well walls are still worthless the ai cant defend their settlements for shit it is such an epic fail and makes sieges just a pain on both ends i hate them

several of the older races empire dwarves dark elves especially just feel bland now in immortal empires the empires mechanics are terrible cathay isnt a finished race bretonnia needs attention 

realms of chaos is a bad campaign pure and simple it just isnt all that good id welcome arguments to the contrary but it wasnt well executed for the original characters on release and was insulting that they released wh3 with the game being unfinished immortal empires wasnt out yet and cathay wasnt finished and still doesnt feel finished the new chaos dwarves feel much more fleshed out than they do

ca is half assing a lot of their content it is infuriating to see they are capable of doing a much better job and i cannot recommend any product from them in good faith while they keep putting out games dlcs and other updates that just arent up to snuff unfinished unpolished untested and they expect us to accept it for what it is test it for them and wait for months to have proper changes by which point weve moved on to the next paid title theyve released where they can take in more money


#####

ca is doing a good job on fixes  patches along with community feedback but i would highly recommend to just wait another year or until immortal empires releases in the games current state it lacks enough content for the 60 asking price

ive been playing total war games since over two decades starting with imedieval 1i which my cousin hugo gave me when i was a student a poisoned gift which did a lot of harm to my studies but i loved it

the series has evolved a great deal over the years the 2d sprites of ishoguni and imedieval 1i were replaced by animated 3d units from irome 1i on imedieval 2i increased the tactical depth through an amazing diversity of units iempirei brought in naval battles inapoleoni multiplayer campaigns ishoguni 2 character skill trees irome 2i added the province system and combined landnaval battles it also introduced us to the current business model liveops games marked by buggy launches but polished over time and enriched by tons of free and paid content this is true for tww3 iattilai opened the door to nomadic hordes ithree kingdomsi improved diplomacy itroyi innovated with a resource bartering economy and the amazon unit upgrade system the iwarhammeri trilogy dramatically increased the playstyle variety with unique mechanics per faction

its final chapter adds a fair share of features
 units from allied factions can be recruited through outposts
 entire armies from allied factions can be borrowed through diplomacy
 immortal empires is a sandbox megamap with an immense replay value as nearly 300 factions fight over 550 regions
 region trading is back a neat tool to manage your allies
 the recently added chaos dwarfs dlc represent a challenge to the usual way to play and a step further in asymmetry since they ignore standard mechanics such as growth but come with their own economic and tactical complexities
 plenty of quality of life from tooltips and ui colour schemes to endgame scenario settings

building these features on top of the solid foundations of the tw series has resulted in a deep and gripping game many strategic and tactical layers dozens of highly diverse factions an impossibly large amount of quality content with more planned on the roadmap the issues which plagued the launch such as the socalled antiplayer bias have been fixed as a strategy gamer and fan of warhammer fantasy all i need is more spare time to indulge in it

as the admin of urlhttpssteamcommunitycomgroupstbtacticsturnbased tacticsurl im lucky to have received a free copy from creative assembly however warhammer has always been a pricey hobby and clearly this digital adaptation is no exception it begs to be installed on an ssd to cut on the loading time the base game is more expensive than most strategy titles and by most i mean igary grigsbys war in the easti and then you may want to pick some of the many dlcs of the trilogy to complete the rosters of your favourite factions gamers on a budget should wait for a sale on the bright side there are tons of free units and features to get from the steam workshop thanks to a thriving mod community

#####

now that immortal empires is out i think this game deserves a positive review there are still issues but the game is well worth playing and will only get better

#####

this is a good game not a great game not a bad game but certainly a good game 7 factions and a handful of decent legendary lords to give you a sense of how to play the same sure the realms of chaos main story line could be annoying to deal with after a while but youre also getting to visit the realms of chaos whats not to like about that and if the main story line is still scaring you away dont worry each new dlc released up to this point has its own narrative that takes advantage of the realms of chaos map but doesnt immediately force you to jump through another giant portal every 10 turns some of the stand alone stories and their content are actually really great look at champions of chaos 4 legendary lords each competing for the ultimate prize in a thunderdome battle to risk it all or take it all with their own unique blend of one of the 4 chaos god factions mixed in with the more standard chaos warrior faction and that dlc is at the asking price of about 15  20 unlike the 25 that were seeing these days
and if youre wanting to get deep into the lore then try out the immortal empires campaign which is completely free if you buy this game imagine having a game that spans the entire earth and every other county or country is run by a lord or a character with compelling story amazing abilities powerful faction mechanics and theyre all competing or assisting each in creating the biggest fantasy empires youve never heard about join the empire and lead the sons of sigmar against the horrors that threaten humanity or join one of those horrors and destroy the empire now granted you will have to get the other two games and dlc to experience all of that content but i genuinely think that its worth your time and money heck theres even a lot of people out there on the internet whove come up with all kinds of guides dlc buying guides tier lists recommendations for new players and everything you could ask for as a new player trying to jump into the game
honestly even with the recent controversy going on i will confess that the greed of the company does hurt me to see and it certainly shouldnt be allowed to keep on going like it has but that shouldnt stop you from buying this game or anything related to this trilogy if you want to a lot of the dlc is more reasonably priced and if the public has their way well either see those newer dlc prices drop or double in quality to match that price
so join us if you like its always better to have more players and even with the concerning events going on surrounding the game right now this is still a great trilogy and worth your time and money if you are willing to pour the time into it

#####

give it another year and it could be worth the price

#####

i enjoy this i think in the beginning the game was a little rough dropped it for a few months but as of july 2022 i like it 

a lot of people are upset about the lack of immortal empires and i understand that its a great way to play but to be honest i only played immortal empires with friends in tww2 so my enjoyment hasnt been impacted the current campaign promotes defensive strategies and securing your borders the relationships with your neighbors matter more than the previous vortex campaign from tww2
 
if you play total war in singleplayer mostly then i recommend it based on the updates their team has been pushing you should expect things to get better 

tldr this game is fun i like it and itll probably get even better with time based off the updates

#####

this is my first review on steam ever i have held off from writing a review partially because i wanted to give ca an opportunity to right the ship despite such a rough initial start 

however a year plus later here we are and the game is in a sad state bugs hamper the playability and enjoyment and the company it seems appears content with their product as is 

moreover it seems that promises of fixing the evergrowing list of bugs are correlated to the release of dlcs 

personally i would have spent another 100 on dlcs i own all of them but the sad state of the game will make me wait until the base game improves if ever 

potentially tragic ending to what would have been a monumental achievement

#####

its a good way to spend 2000 hrs of your life

#####

this has to be the most frustrating game in existence no not because of difficulty there are so many great improvements and yet every single one of them is ruined by some other issue i have over 9000 hours in twwh2 i loved that game so much the only complaint i think i ever had and it was only a minor thing was sieges were a little dull

now sieges are simply awful the pop up tower defense game that they have turned into is just plain terrible i hate everything about it it doesnt graphically look right nor add anything interesting to the battle they are just an annoyance that feels really out of place and makes the game look silly this is especially annoying since the maps themselves are amazing why add this dumb mechanic who ever thought it up should be fired immediately 

then there is the level cap increase i have no issue with this overall but the fact that heroes often dont have enough skills to spend the points on what the heck you need a mod to make use of those points or a skill dump thats just pathetic 

another point of contention for me is the check boxes for notifications i dont understand why these setting cannot be saved every single campaign i have uncheck a number of these that are useless and annoying i know that sounds like a very minor thing but its annoying likewise with unsaved camera setting modders found a way but ca cant

then there is balance or more accurately there isnt every unit seems wildly unbalanced in ways that continue to shock me there are far to many units to go through to explain this in detail but it needs a lot of work in this regard 

another issue is the new magic system it makes no sense at all the old system was great why change it 

finally there is performance its horrible this game runs absolutely terrible on any settings whats even more annoying is that battles run great but the campaign map runs horrible so the place where you are 99 of the time is the worst part so you turn the setting down to look terrible so you can get a stable fps and then the battles which would be fine look like trash very annoying 

however all this said there are many good points to list unit variety impressive maps great sound track amazing audio race variety with unique mechanics the list could go on for hours as there are so many great sides to it all thats why its so frustrating 

i really really really want to love this game there is so much work put into it that should make it great but it all falls short over and over because of really dumb decisions 

if i can say any one thing really ruins it its those siege mechanics if they dropped the dumb pop up towers and buildable siege tools in battle it would be so much better also if they made siege equipment make sense instead of battering rams that are useless and the like 

none the less all complaints aside i still recommend this game there is enough here to keep it interesting and one can hope they resolve these issues over time we will see 

also this is including immortal empires with out that the game is 210 hard pass

#####

this is the third game in a trilogy of games they didnt have to create a new game engine they didnt have to improve graphics in a major way they didnt have to deal with creating entirely brand new game mechanics all they had to do was take what they learned from the previous two games and create new content for a preexisitng game engine somehow after 5 years of development they managed to thoroughly fuck that up

whats a further disgrace is that only 3 months after release total war warhammer 2 has on average 3000 more concurrent players than this game yikes

#####

new new new review its starting to feel right they need to keep embracing the fun aspects but its getting better

new new review just not that fun load times are longer than the previous game everything just feels a little more tedious and theres just not that much in the way of payoff developers seem to have forgotten the key element of fun for this one

new review immortal empires is coming in the next month and it looks awesome the first dlc looks great as well


old review i love tww2 i have thousands of hours both legit campaigns and modded to hell i was looking forward to this for ages and fully expected it to be somewhat base at launch

tww2 is the better richer game at this time as other reviewers have mentioned there are a lot of cool features and improvements in tww3 but with the main campaign being limiting and constricting some bugs and optimization issues lack of content and polish my recommendation is to wait until modding and the combined immortal empires map are released stick to tww2 for now

ill update my review as things change but for now its a no for me

#####

i really like total war as a series but i wont buy anymore dlcs until the price point comes down they are not delivering on the quality of their dlcs anymore to meet the price point they are asking around 50 of the base cost of a standard full game for a dlc with 1 faction or a few more units and balancing that should be free anyway 

the new dlcs are still not worth the asking price maybe worth at 15 euro price range its price to quality and quantity is better now that the devs were mocked and shamed to make it better cause the community did not want to swallow their st and yet still not worth the asking price at 25 euro per dlc

dont get me wrong i like this game theres plenty of good things to enjoy and have fun but the resent business practices of the company has left a bad impression the price of the latest dlc being the prime issue

its a mostly a fun game but the dm pricing

#####

why in the good name of god does my fucking units during a defencive siege retreat outside of my walls when they break but when the enemy units break they retreat deeper into my fuck city every single time how the fuck are these fucking devs this shitty and stupid 

we are broken run towards the enemy

#####

as of now total war warhammer iii does not exactly stand on its own compared to total war warhammer ii due to a lack of content owing to its current infancy and lack of expansive addons and updates seen in warhammer ii this likely would not be the case if it shipped with mortal empires on day one and did not elect to release without add the very least a skinandbones placeholder version of the chaos dwarves instead using orks as a placeholder

the game itself runs somewhat poorly it is not well optimized however this can be mitigated by running at a decreased resolution and lowered textures this however is entirely temporary and shouldnt factor into your interest but only your interest immediately unless youre a huge fan of kislev cathay chaos or the ogre kingdoms i would highly suggest delaying your purchase until the future when there is more content to be had as your time will likely be better spent in warhammer ii where you will still have access to the content from warhammer i and ii

that being said chaos is an extremely well designed faction from a gameplay standpoint and has some unique mechanics that stand out from anything else creative assembly has ever made having tried out the first several turns of most factions by now i can safely but unfortunately say that the legion of chaos is by far my favorite which is unfortunate to me because i was mostly looking forward to the ogre kingdoms

as for the campaign it is about as sandboxy as vortex was but with a new mechanic involving the invasion of each realm of chaos to slay a daemon prince as opposed to completing rituals as in warhammer ii i personally enjoy it

lastly the minor settlements and siege battles i am not as adverse to the change as other people are while the supply system is bizarre at best im not convinced that it is entirely detrimental to gameplay after playing a few rounds however i would appreciate a setting to be able to disable this mechanic and return to the old design i do enjoy the designs of the maps though and i really like the new survival mode for custom battles

at its current state i would suggest waiting for further updates unless youre a diehard fan of total war fantasy or any of the races in warhammer iii barring of course chaos dwarves

i run an old am3 cpu 8gb of ddr3 ram and a gtx 1050ti which is an extremely obsolete setup for this game however after twiddling with the settings im able to run the game at about 57fps which is tolerable to me it is possible for me to gain almost 100fps at very low settings but the blurriness strains my eyes

id give it about a 710 right now you might enjoy it conditionally but i wouldnt recommend it to everyone

#####

sad  how i love those total war games but no  im not going to pay that insane price for a few more things 
and i bought all the wh2 dlc you could have my money  you know  easy  but not like that

#####

as youve probably noticed some people have really enjoyed this game and others have not i fall into the category of one who doesnt mind the realm of chaos campaign that many others despise yes at times it can be annoying but as someone who has plays the vortex campaign in total war warhammer 2 im quite used to this type of campaign and dont need to wait for immortal empires to come out

some pros to the game
 decent faction selection base game has 9 legendary lords from 7 different factions
 map is very large and allows for diversity in what enemies and friends you come across
 individual faction mechanics for every faction that adds some flavor to each one
 skarbrand the exiled punting most characters across the map
 graphics are pretty good especially on higher settings
 modding community is wonderful

cons
 immortal empires isnt out yet less sandboxish for now as you are kind of forced into playing the souls race unless you have a mod that turns it off
 limited units as of now for each faction especially the daemonic factions
 cannot play as the warhammer one and two races this doesnt faze me but i know it affects a lot of people that fancy playing the empire for the 50th time
 antiplayer bias still is strong but much better than what it was at release back in february of 2022

conclusion
personally i think the game is worth it and it is only going to get better as we progress further into the year if you are waiting for immortal empires then i would hold off until later this year when the beta gets set up for that if you really want to try out new factions like cathay which is newish to lore and the daemons then i would recommend getting this game 

i hope this helps you all make a good decision

#####

the replayability on this game is astounding  and its really fun to play with friends now buying all the requisite basegames is costly and all the skaven related dlc unless you are getting it on a steam sale  but thats nothing new

earlier this year ca released a dlc called forge of the chaos dwarves an all new race with neat new mechanics and units consisting of 3 legendary lords it was well received by basically all and launched with minimal or next to 0 issues   it is by far one of my fav factions to play personally it cost 25 

now cas executives and board are releasing a lord pack shadows of change and it simply doesnt stack up based on the value proposition that they themselves have established with the chaos dwarves dlc shadows is the same price but includes no new races and no revolution in mechanics and very few new units apparently the kislev lord is also bugged  to the point of unplayability im not getting shadows of change because it doesnt live up to the value proposition that ca itself established earlier this year 

total war is cas biggest property but instead of training their strengths by giving twwarhammer the time and attention the game needs the executives and board are clearly plowing total war profits into their derivative fortvalerant clone and inevitable failure of a game called hyenas pathetic

ca executives and board members are clearly a bunch of outoftouch hacks who know nothing of business do they not know that chasing after other audiences to the detriment of your core products has not worked for any entertainment company  from modern cinema writ large to netflix to disney are they paying attention do they think they are better positioned then  multibillion dollar entertainment companies who have failed at the same gamble games workshop needs to revisit this partnership and read the ca board the riot act or else risk the poisoning of a massive onramp to gws own ip 

so i come back to what i said in the first line of this review the replayability of this game is amazing therefore i dont need this new crap dlc to make and to keep this game fun for me and my friends so i wont be buying anything from ca at least until their garbage secondary product hyenas launches and subsequently fails

#####

unless you like to actively beta test and deal with game breaking bugs and the inevitable mess that every update brings to your installed mods stay with twwh2 and wait a few years for a good sale to properly enjoy this game if youre a fan of fantasy themed total war

its a real shame you cant freeze a version or rollback to whatever version is working best for you and your preferences due to steam and ca forcing you to update instead of you being able to update your game whenever you want having to redo settings and mods that might or might not work with a newer version just because the a new patch is forced upon you is asinine and a huge waste of time that could be better spent playing a game thats already stable and feature complete and  you can tweak to your own proper liking without worrying about our current playthrough going into the abyss due to circumstances that should not be outside your control

if youre enjoying the current mess the games state is in though keep having fun dredging through the muck

#####

an excellent game if you hate yourself and want to experience more bugs than the invasion scene of starship troopers 
i love it 1010

#####

hands down my favorite game and trilogy i never write reviews but i felt i had to for this one because ive already sunk a lot of time in it and plan on sinking even more as time goes on

realm of chaos campaign
its good for a play through of whatever factions you find interesting the story picks up from the prologue so be sure to play it even if youre a total war veteran dont worry its actually really nice while its the main selling point of the game the real meat and potatoes is

immortal empires
if you own game 1 and 2 you get access to immortal empires which is a gigantic world map with all factions from all three games in it available to play if the faction is a dlc you must own the dlc obviously this is where the game truly shines and provides thousands of hours of playtime as of writing theres a total of 86 playable legendary lords factions you want to paint the world map with your colors via world domination create an alliance superpower rid the world of the evil chaos factions rid the world of order factions as the chaos factions assert elven supremacy as the high elves this is where you do it

as per total war the secret sauce is the enjoyable mix of a turnbased strategy on the campaign map where you move armies do diplomacy etc and real time battles no other game to my knowledge does this as well as total war

couple all this with the fantastic universe that is warhammer fantasy and this game is justchefs kiss as a warhammer fan this game has been a dream for decades

the game did launch a bit rocky realm of chaos campaign but was fixed and changed a bit according to player feedback
there are also some bugs that the devs are aware of specifically in the immortal empires which is why they label it as a beta they are constantly tweaking and fixing issues that crop up as they create a truly massive and one of a kind experience

the modding community is fantastic with hundreds of mods available to suite your specific tastes and needs

with the amount of content available for this game and more coming every 36 months the price is well worth it if you are at all a total war fan warhammer fan or fantasy fan

#####

lots of our players seem to hate siege battles so lets make most of the battles siege battles

ca probably

edit

alright now that immortal empires is out and now there are mods that get rid of most minor settlement battles i can recommend total warhammer iii now you win

while immortal empires certainly was a breath of fresh air for the game there are still so many bugs and simply downgrades from game 2 that i would not recommend this game if you dont know what you are getting into i still play it and enjoy it but thats only because i can overlook the major issues that plague the game and especially how incredibly slow ca has been at addressing any of them  just go play total war warhammer 2 instead which is in a great state right now

a few specific major and minor negatives for immortal empires the twwh3 campaign alone is awful so lets just pass over that


the ui is just straight up worse than game 2 i dont even know what happened here except that they wanted to change it for the sake of changing it the faction selection is terrible mission panel is worse to use etc

sound design is good for the most part but once again projectile units sound like  with very few exceptions almost like someone else did them specifically both blackpowder and bowscrossbows

many factions have been nerfed and a lot of their interesting mechanics removed while i do understand the need to reduce power in some cases the big problem here is the lack of anything interesting in its stead just ends up making them less exciting to play
bugs bugs oh so many bugs yes thats to be expected but they could at least have done some hotfixes by now some of them make certain factions nighunplayable or remove key parts of their identity lack of items heroes quests etc

hero traits  what the hell happened here the vast majority of them are just straight up awful while some are very good i dont expect all of them to be great but at least something decent rn the difference in power is astonishing ogres are especially notorious here with some default traits providing bigger benefits than their unique faction traits in the same attribute cathay similarly has some very weird traits  all the good ones are of one type yin while the yang traits are just plain useless thats not even to speak of factions that pretty much only have useless traits

personal issue but the game is generally too easy right now the ai is way too passive even at legendary leading to extremely fast campaign burnout by turn 50 the campaign is basically over cause nothing can challenge you anymore

lack of field battles this is especially notorious on higher difficulties due to the ai sitting in their settlements as soon as they even get a whiff of your army additionally since the autoresolve is as forgiving as it is right now you barely ever fight any field battles past turn 20 its always siege or minor settlement battles which are both incredibly easy to defeat easier than field battles in most cases this has a lot of knockon effects such as gunpower units being generally awful in actual battle due to the ai behaving smarter by avoiding los and targeting them with archers or ranged units in general being subpar again due to ai perfectly microing to avoid being shot as much as possible this leads to sieges being either a melee slog or being cheesed in the vast majority of cases

continuing with the gunpowder issue the obstacle detection right now is so jank that often those type of units dont even shoot if there is virtually nothing in front of them it was already bad in game 2 but so much worse now you often cant even shoot larger targets stuck in your infantry because they seemingly dont realize that 60 of those trolls are sticking out above the heads of their comrades add to that the fact that most ai actively targets gunpowder units such as handgunners ironhails thunderers etc and youll likely get a better performance out of any bowcrossbow unit those can shoot above your own units have less targetting issues and most importantly dont require 10 seconds of micro each to get into a position where they can actually shoot properly

there are many other points that irk me but i think these are some that might give you an idea of whether or not you may enjoy the game in its current state i do believe it will get better with time but as it is now i cant see this being anytime soon

#####

this is nice for 300 dollars game but not nice is the publisher who threaten me i dont like mean publisher try to be nice to your customer and no threats with 300 dollars game thank you pujab

#####

h1 this game feels like its designed by 8 year olds with way too much creativity and free time h1
list
    lets make a fighting game not just with groups but with whole armies with thousands of animated units fighting in real time
    melee fights are boring lets add dragons magic nukes magic nukes air balloons flying knights guns rockets mummies vampires mansized rodents rodentsized mans and every single fantasy race known to man oh and make every single race plays radically different
    every single battle should feel different lets make every terrain has different battlefield and add grand sieges too with ladders siege towers and battering rams did i mention towers lets make them i love btd
    why limit ourselves lets simulate a whole ass franchise universe
    magic spells are cool lets add five no ten no a hundred and make flashy special effect for each spells we have giant moving flaming skulls spiritual kick from a giant orcish god and magical longboat summonning on land
    add a whole economy and diplomacy simulation why not
    lets add french people
    as a player who wouldnt want to customize their character add a new faction with wholly customizable legendary lord
list

and somehow it runs perfectly well ca ought to tell me which chaos god they contracted because i am in dire need some miracle in my life

#####

i love the total wahammer series and ive got a lot of enjoyment from this game with mods and such however right now it is in an unacceptable state for consumers a glacial update pace together with unfixed bugs problems and a new terrible dlc price policy make it hard to not give this game a negative review at the moment

#####

edit

after recent actions it is clear ca is taking the situation seriously still has a positive review from me

a good game but not a great game

get your act together ca dont become games workshop remain the custom high quality game maker you were for medieval ii and shogun ii

#####

realm of tzeench is fucking atrocious

#####

any fun im having with this game tends to be despite the game rather than because of the game 

needs tune up for unit responsiveness in battles and pathing sick of units deciding that the contested ladder looks so much faster than the wide open unblocked gate and i absolutely 100 orders a unit to run around in a circle for the purposes of them just skipping the entire shift clicked route and decided that actually they were just going to count it all as completed and get completely deleted by artillery 

they also still havent really fixed siege battles walls tend to be kinda barren and it just feels wrong still for a setting that is known for some extremely well defended cities it would be good if there were fallback positions or something that were consistently viable across the various walled maps 

ai also cheats or is given mechanical cheats  like how you often arent allowed a retreat zone from ambushes the retreat zone exists outside the map and is inaccessible so fun and engaging when skaven get to paint themselves purple as you watch and then cut your limbs off with no reinforcements so engaging great design offensive ambushes in general are bad mechanics that have zero counterplay aside from having a good enough individual army to just win every battle after you watch the completely meaningless unskippable 15 second cutscene of your leader walking which is so interesting when you have to deal with another stupid rat ambush 

performance is honestly terrible  maxing out a 3070ti on high at 1440p not quite 60fps on the campaign map the same campaign map where zone edge borders are aliased when theres corruption like its 2005

i dont have ridiculous standards but i do expect some quality of life from the third game i should not be ragequitting from bs every session after getting sick of clawing for every shred of satisfaction 

not to mention the questionable notion of campaign difficulty impacting auto resolve instead of the battle difficulty setting surely if auto resolve is meant to represent your battles the difficulty thereof should be what controls it rather than wanting diplomacy map blobbing and economy to be more challenging

bug are a thing i have a campaign where the quest battle didnt spawn and cant be teleported to 

ai also appears to play by different movement rules so they kinda just teleport behind you for a fun and engaging game of whackamole with march stance they also like to do nonsense double jeopardy battles where theyll assault and lose then immediately reattack and this is mechanically bs because defender units get completely wiped out when they break but attacker units do not it makes some sense because half the time defender units run out into enemy territory but thats also nonsense because theres a keep to retreat to 

and because the chain of nonsense isnt quite over yet this game causes frequent bluescreens  about 1 every ten hours of playtime its only this game and it happens exactly when i click an ingame button 

and theres this weird thing where ca required the first two games for a good chunk of the immortal empires content but also still absolutely 100 insists theyre worth the full aaa 60 pricetag for reasons

rereview
all of the same hold but mods do improve it but mods can only do so much and cant do anything at all about how your units have a mind of their own andor ears full of cotton might as well build a monstrous infantry doomstack because every unit behaves like them

it also disables all your mods every time the game updates so you better write down which ones you had on

and for some reason fullscreen is just two or three pixels short i was hoping itd go away but no amount of debugging and troubleshooting actually made the game not have strange bugged pixels in the lower left and a few columns along the right no other game including the previous two games does this so its just completely baffling

#####

only tech issue i had was some blurriness which was resolved by changing antialias method

the new factions are good fun been getting lots of fun out of it and there are many many improvements over wh2 overall
to the point that i wouldnt be able to go back if i wanted to alliances quick diplomacy reinforcement timers actual settlements settlement trading ect

but the realm of chaos campaign itself is very annoying youll get rifts spawning every 30 turns that spew out armies agents and corruption and you get no rewards when doing the main story which leaves you little incentive to do so a second or third time

the optimal way to win is just capture a province or two and just end turn until you get the rifts

because you are penalised if you try to expand the only way to deal with rifts enmasse is to spam heros and sit them at the rift spawns which is incredibly tedious and closing each rift costs 1500 gold if you do it this way so it gets quite expensive

to add to this the ai is terrible at dealing with rifts to the point that the entire map except your territory becomes the chaos wastes making it even more tedious due to attrition

really keen on mortal empires but  overall its still a massive improvement
just not sure why they went for such a tedious and unrewarding main campaign at least i could ignore the vortex

#####

modern game company try not to alienate their fan base and ruin their legacy for a quick buck challenge completely impossible

#####

update review since 30

still a no  i honestly can say i have not had as much fun with 3 than i did with 2 and thats why i would still pass on this title

how the campaign works and why it sucks

factions you have no interaction with will declare war on you  5050 chance that enemy army will show up to attack a settlement while you are engaged with the wars waging with your close up enemies  

your settlement protection is a mix bag of the worst units in your faction and 1 or 2 gooddecent  the only way these settlements have a chance to win some engagements is a settlement map battle which by far is the least fun fights in the game

campaigns become tedious you push into an enemy another enemy comes behind you  the only way to have side armies is basically just spamming t1 cheap units  in wh2 you could usually field 1 good army and a second or third with a single settlement depending on faction  tw3 its basically just a revolving door of trash armies  plan on loosing them a lot

enemy attacks come at specific times  for real i have had dozens of enemies declare war on me and do nothing  dozens of turns they just sit around  but the second i move my armies out to attack boom they move  

there is no decent way to defend yourself i have not won a single domination victory for any faction save khorne and taurox the brass bull  you cannot capture hundreds of settlements without a steam rolling faction  which is why it becomes so tedious to play  not fun tedious  

thats total warhammer 3  tedious  

throw in the bad movement for models  the poor model collisions with single entities  the ridiculous power of ranged units yes its even worse in 3  they have made the good units uncanny and the bad units dumpster fires for almost every faction  

magic is even more lopsided  

battles are tedious chasing down lords that just saunter off every chance they get  your units stop attacking while in melee combat  

the whole thing is tedious  just tedious

play this with mods its the only way to enjoy it

#####

this is a bit of a sad review because its nearly an incredibly good game nearly every aspect of the game is far improved on warhammer 1 and 2 but with a few very noteable downgrades that ruin the experience entirely because of this ill only list my complaints


ui

the ui was intentionally downgraded for some reason in tw1 and tw2 it was much clearer what was build built and destroyedrecruited and disbanded because it was highlighted in green or red for some reason everything in this game is red possibly to try and distinguish itself from the other games but as a result its a lot less readable 

performance

for me performance is okayish looks great but the benchmarks for the prerelease had much much higher frames they were slashed significantly for release some even by half and many are speculating denuvo is the cause

crashes

i have completed one campaign and i have crashed easily 40 times in 20 hours of play most of this is only when you tab out but with a multimonitor set up its extremely unstable and more than half of those crashes resulted in me having to restart my pc completely

campaign

this part is the most fixable but also the most egregious issue with the game while nearly every part of the campaign mechanics and battles is extremely high quality and fun the main campaign the realms of chaos is not fun it seems specifically designed to not be fun why

the game will spawn portals all over the map which cause massive corruption spread and eventually spawn doomstacks that come out and roam around they can either be killed with an army theyre defended by 20 units or deleted for a fee of 1500 with an agent this means around turn 150 i had 15 of these portals in my lands playing whackamole for them all is extremely time consuming boring and punishing it dictates how you play entirely 

the realms themselves are even worse you have to enter 4 to win the game theyre extremely time consuming and offer no rewards one rewards you essentially for failing it others give you some minor stuff rarely but its not really a reward in fact completing them punishes you by spawning more and more enemies in the world you need to complete this for the victory but its so agonising heres what you have to do for all 4

slaanesh
take 10 or so turns just walking through portals at the end kill a big boss at any time if you leave you get given massive rewards the most thematic and cool of all of them but still a pain similar fight to khorne mentioned later

khorne
kinda agony kill things capture a thing then defend it repeat three times takes a very long time 12 hours and really burns you out its really not clear where enemies will come from and you can get wiped easily by not deploying properly

nurgle
youre in a plane that you constantly take damage in have to walk around and pick up gifts to survive longer then big fight at the end takes a long time but the fastest and most punishing of the 4

tzeench
i dont know who made this place but thematically its on point a literal confusing hellscape you get lost and tormented in its completely rng boring and frustrating all 4 realms everything you interact with essentially takes your turn away its made even worse where in this realm you have to interact with teleporters that may or may not take you where you want to go

basically its a good game but has a handful of smaller issues but all of that is overshadowed by the mammoth that is the campaign its so poorly designed antifun and frustrating i would never recommend it to anyone pick it up when they reworkremove it or when they add immortal empires realms of chaos is not worth your time

#####

i played through all the campaigns of each race once including greasus for the ogre kingdoms dlc i refused to try skarbrand since there is no blood or gore in a game with a ll and faction dedicated to the chaos god of blood and skulls the game is closer to a mod overhaul than a sequel to wh2 and anyone claiming it is unfair to compare them is how we got the dow 3 debacle as far as technical issues it ran fine my machine had 0 issues it really is a mess on every level though there are talents for nurgle for example that are literally copy pasted and others that do not work or even worse the slaanesh one that disables bonuses from all other sources for diplomacy  effectively killing half the mechanics for that faction 

kislev is a major disappointment and it is readily apparent all the work and effort went into katarin and kostaltyn was an afterthought who is as barebones as an empire general ignoring the flanderisation of ice and bears literally everywhere there are mods that fix this and return bardiche axed streltsi etc ironically the ice school of magic is dogshit the tempest one has a few standouts and is better overall but still weaker bears are probably the strongest cav in the game right now maybe even more so than other warhammer faction and this is a certainty with boris buffing them the other 3 cav units of kislev are pointless elemental bear is a single target only huge missile sponge monster and sucks 
had the most fun after unlocking boris and swapping my campaign to him so that i could ignore the reputation race also not being the prime target from all sides by literally everyone not human was a better campaign

cathay on the other hand is far more fleshed out and overall has mostly useful units at all tiers the terracotta warriors would be good but their size and flashy animations means they usually miss whatever they are trying to hit anyway miao buffed cathay artillery is the best of any warhammer faction including the dwarves the added bonus of the hot air balloon fire rocket battery having more ammo than imperial rockets of the empire and damage and a better position in all situation to fire from is obvious power creep cathay still needs work dlcs might flesh it out if the game lives long enough to get any

tzeentch was super strong and fun until they nerfed barriers due to mp complaints and now his armies are just super squishy skirmishers without the speed to accomplish it tzeentch magic is super powerful though not that anyone can even experience it since the major faction battle mechanic involving generating winds of magic literally does not work you press the button the visual effects go off but nothing actually happens in sp or mp or custom battles did not stop ca nerfing it

nurgle needs work his cauldron is less than half the interaction and effects of groms and the randomness of application is not only unloreful and closer to tzeentch  but is functionally worthless the most viable way to play him is to group everything up and slowly roll your murderball towards the enemy for a moshpit fight spamming heals as needed boring and exceptionally weak strategically looks cool though

daemon lord is a bit boring i only tried him out after they massively buffed everything about him since he was the worst ll in any role ever released i can remember lords from rome 1 with better campaign and battle bonusesstrengths like numidia i ended up going undivided but it was the last campaign i played and i was thoroughly sick of the game by then 

no blood no khorne

cannot stand slaanesh and its champions ironically the faction is mostly broken technically or by design like if you use your uber seduction mechanic to seduce an order faction into a vassal  which should be seen as a victory for chaos  all the other daemon factions will instantly declare war on you making the entire point of the factions strengths redundant

greasus and the other ogre are unfinished factions that suffer from being a pre order faction like chaos in wh1 the primary mechanic of contracts can be safely and should be ignored since you just end up going to war with everyone around you for practically non existent gold and reputation rewards it should be closer to cathays caravan mechanic and allow you to siege and kill a certain character or settlement or achieve something without it ruining your diplomacy or offer some kind of redemption contract after the fact to get back in the good graces of whoever you where paid a pittance to mess up currently it is a really shit declare war against random visible faction every 10 turns mechanic with dog shit rewards making the best choice every time to simply ignore it ogres have good units that are fun and interesting some are extremely strong if the gorgers are anything to go by mp will have the rest gutted into uselessness while being stupidly expensive like they are now but worth it

overall the campaign map might be bigger than ever but it feels tiny since more than half is barren chaos territory that you cannot reasonably conquer if not a daemonic faction daemonic factions have critical issues all round  thought i have heard skarbrand is fine except i see the lack of blood and gore a serious critical issue when playing a khornate faction the chaos realms are shit the idea is shit tzeentchs realm literally cheats and has no counter play beyond hoping the ai doesnt go there while you are there or spawns near you so you can quickly take them out before they auto complete it 

being forced to interact with a timed mechanic that can auto lose your campaign does not work in total war the vortex campaign was not that great but at least the art mechanics and scripts were all complete most of the end cut scenes do not even have depictions of your ll interacting with ursun just the same scene with a voice over compared to wh2 where there were custom scenes per race with some altered per ll that were not 20 secs long and you had 6 times of them overall the vortex campaign spawned in armies just like the realm race and they had issues like some dicking around in someone elses territory raiding it but being unable to be fought by whoever they were not spawned against however you had the option to gang up on the winner of the vortex race if it wasnt you and fight them permanently ending the whole thing and allowing you to continue

survival battles and the last one against belakor are interesting maybe once each per faction then they become a bore but you cannot auto resolve the final fight not to mention the reward of getting belakor who is a terrible ll and is only unlocked for your current playthrough with no bonus faction unlock is atrocious they already have everything he needs in game for a faction and literally should be available as an option instead of the custom daemon lord 

maybe immortal empires will fix all of this it is not coming out till sept 22 at the earliest and is already declared a beta ca is the largest developer in the uk and yet they are proving beyond doubt that they clearly have bled most of their competency and talent out of the main dev teams there are numerous incredibly simple designscriptvisual errors that modders literally fixed in a week that took ca 6 weeks to address 10 of even then most of the easiest to fix ones

ca clearly doesnt play their own game internally it must be chaos there no pun intended the dlc team had to release a formal announcement of taking over all future development of the game so maybe it will be decent in a year or so if the game is still supported by the end of the year maybe 

right now do not waste your time or money

#####

despite unsavory business practice by casega overpriced dlcs etc this game is objectively good perhaps among the greatest of the total war series
playing the immortal empires campaign coop with my friends was an absolute blast

#####

i want this game to be so successful however the changes to the dlc lack of bug fixes and refusing to speak to the fanbase has left a bad taste in many of our mouths

#####

greedy company that charges hundreds of dollars to unlock the full games content and locks upgraded units behind dlcs

#####

kill rats stupid rats kill kill them vermin kill rats i hate the rats kill the rats die

#####

warhammer 1 had a simple campaign which consisted of grow your empire and survive the chaos invasion
warhammer 2 had the vortex campaign with resource gathering for the base 4 factions and a myriad of other factions with unique goals added as dlc 
this iteration warhammer 3 has a very different campaign that focuses on survival and fulfilling the campaign goal i believe this is good campaign that will only get better with more development

baring the technical issues right now during launch the game is great and if you liked the previous games then this one is just as good

#####

immortal empires is the pinnacle of fantasy strategy gaming 270 fractions and enough variety to make your head dizzy this is what i dreamed of when i first played tww in 2016 perfection

#####

i cannot support cas new dlc prices

#####

man sized rats dont exist
notified some city under my city
next turn city explodes from manrat nuke
1010

#####

roughly as optimized as the holy roman empire was

#####

dlcs are more and more expensive for less and less content and we very seldom see any of that money go back into the game itself

 sieges have been bad since warhammer 1 and keep getting worse
 enemy ai is an absolute joke
 old races stagnate with minimal updates
 more and more and more bugs crop up every patch

reminder that this company has been charging for blood effects for years now 
they have zero respect for you beyond what you can pay them the hilarious irony is warhammer is their best treated total war they unceremoniously dropped britannia three kingdoms and troy when they werent making enough money and they will absolutely do it to this and pharaoh the second its not as juicy to milk

the full buyin price at this point is insane and will keep getting worse play something else

#####

launch was a disaster but the game is getting better with every update the immortal empires campaign is a dream come true for every old wfb fan like me keep it up ca

#####

at the current state simply not worth it it will be a great game after some time with immortal empires and fixes of performance issues etc

pros
 its tw warhammer 
 great faction additions
 quality of life improvements like quick deal alliances
 great prologue
 enjoyable gameplay

xccons
 campaign is a race boring at that with constant opening of rifts requiring annoying closing them which favours just playing tall and punishing playing wide 
 campaign is cool to finish one time but have very little replayability even for other new races
 campaign requires addition of opting out from narrative or at least mods support so they can give that option allowing sandbox gameplay its tw after all 
 issues with performance
 issues with graphics  
 sieges nice try but failed one


#####

mortal empires plz

#####

thicc rat man commits crimes against nature with magic cocaine and whips a femboy elf king to death good game

i cant recommend this tldr if you havent bought this game already dont just stick with tww2 it works better and the new factions arent worth it 

with over 2 thousand hours in the second game and a little over two hundred in the first as well as every dlc ca has put out for them this game makes me done with the total war warhammer games ive played the ice queen the chaos dwarves the northern provinces and the shockingly obese and before i got the game on steam i played on game pass where i finished off a prince of chaos and skarbrand campaign so ive touched on all the new factions 

the new order factions are meh and the new chaos factions are really fun but the main issue is the ai the ai was almost a dealbreaker in tww2 they make really terrible decisions dont know how to correctly build settlements or defend their territory and still prioritize the player which would be fine if they could take other threats into account i had grimgor declare war on me while having his capitol threatened by kholek suneater i was able to ambush one army take out the other by leaving someone to defend my settlement and after i took five of his settlements kohlek came in and wiped him out why is the ai bad enough to let this happen

the battle ai hasnt been fixed either units sometimes refuse to stay in formation they sometimes will not go where you tell them to if any units are in contact they tend to ignore most of your orders to fight the unit theyre in contact with which is terrible news for cavalry the ranged ai got much worse as they sometimes just wont fire even with clear line of sight and within range at one point i had an artillery unit stop firing at a target that hadnt moved when i tried to make it fire at that target again they decided they needed to rush it and other times they will just be standing idle after you gave them and order to attack a unit that is not fleeing or broken just moving away the enemy ai for sieges was never fixed and is still extremely easy and ive broken the enemy ai a few times like when i was fighting zombies and they didnt know how to line up so they just kept moving back and forth on their line while i peppered them with artillery shots it went on like that till i was out of aty ammo then rushed in and they barely fought back 

its still not worth it to make any allies until youve cleaned out most of the potential enemies around you the benefit of being able to build their units is kinda cool but the downside of being at war with everyone they are at war with outweighs it by a good bit they did add the ability to trade land so thats an awesome change you no longer have to sit with one useless settlement in a region and can now gift that settlement to a faction for a relations boost nice they wont use it to improve themselves in any way because again the ai cant build settlementsbut it was still a great addition

so yeah it doesnt improve anything and the new factions arent worth it i would say wait for a fix but ive been waiting two years and im done waiting

#####

update after more experience with the game and the clearly lacking qol and bugfixing teams as well as the recent unprecedented price hike and poor customer communication i cant recommend the game in its current state the ca seems to be lacking in ambition or simply incapable to fix and polish the game to its full potential introduction of new bugs and leaving age old bugs left is simply unacceptable 


hard to pick between recommending it currently or waiting for some more patches and the immortal empires campaign some things that i strongly dislike about this game which otherwise shows great potential and effort 

assladders once again ruin any meaningful sieges ladders should be buildable siege equipment moves way too quickly and destroys gates way too quickly too many units  even the most basic ones  can hack through gates making them meaningless completely random and shit places for barricades and buildable towers there are literally useless defensive towers that can only cover like 45 degrees if i cant block all the ways in barricades are pretty much useless barricades are broken way too easily even light missiles can destroy them more free placement of towers and barricades would greatly improve player options against overwhelming chaos stacks 

the chaos portals are too frequent and plentiful necessitating building a garrison building to every single settlement this puts way too much stress and pressure on the early game overall the tempo of the campaign isnt fun its just a race against the usual cheating ai having a vast rich and powerful empire means nothing when all that matters is the faction leaders single doomstack trying to outrun enemies 

tzeentchs faction mechanics should be seriously tuned down as currently they only degrade gameplay i got halted like 10 times in a campaign which is extremely punishing even though i didnt do any mistakes tzeentch also stole several of my settlements again punishing the player without any counter maybe a much more severe cooldown would make it balanced even though it will never be a fun mechanic 

spoiler the ending of the game is just shit and makes no sense why would i want to recruit the main antagonist or even let him live in the first place could be optional for chaos factions but for order factions this is just insanely devoid of any logic also losing to an enemy just ends the campaign without any cutscene the 15turn cooldown to enemies after beating them at the altar doesnt work i had both tzeentch and the ogres respawning to the altar immediately the next turn leading to an inevitable loss

#####

great game honestly the best from the franchise the new dlc is trash overpriced garbage get all the dlc for wh1  2 rather before thinking of going near any new dlcs

#####

the optimization is horrendously bad

i miss the days of when owning a pc that surpasses the recommended specs meant the game would be smooth as butter

#####

this game definitely had a rough launch and the realms of chaos campaign was a not great opener however after putting nearly 500 hours into this game i can solidly say that it is incredible yes it has some issues and i for one would love some overhauls to the older legendary lords  lookin at you malekith the opportunities for fun strategically and role playing wise are immense few games have held my attention this long and have been worth the buying price as this one

#####

i love total war warhammer 2 and have played it for many hoursnevertheless it has some wellknown weaknesses that bothered me a lot especially in the long run eg limited diplomacy little varied battles boring sieges with disadvantages for the defenders gate bug etc 
ive put about 18h into the game so far starting a multiplayer and single player campaign with kislev completing the prologue and briefly starting a multiplayer campaign with cathay based on these experiences ill evaluate the things ive experienced so far 
 
i think its worth noting that ca has taken player feedback to heart to address many of the issues from the previous two games and to make the game even bigger and more varied
i really feel bad for the developers because i recognize a lot of very good intentions and efforts but in its current state the game is unplayable for me and unfortunately this includes many issues that probably cant be easily fixed but are very fundamentally rooted in the games architecture i hope they didnt mess up with this as the game had a great potential 

so first the positive things that really improve the game experience for me
 diplomacy is not a complete revolution but it is much more transparent than before the menu navigation is not optimal especially regarding outposts etc but i think thats a matter of getting used to it i would also like additional transparency concerning the costs of diplomatic actions depending on the general relationship with the faction 
 i like the artwork of the world map and of the new factions small highlights are the descriptions of certain points on the map which fills the whole thing with even more warhammer feeling and story 
 the ui for the heroes and commanders is clearer and somewhat more user friendly especially for followers i also love that this has been expanded further and there are now item sets and you can recycle items for gold or to create new items i had always missed that before
 the simultaneous turns in multiplayer allow for a completely new gameplay experience this is really great the fact that you can let others control parts of your army is really cool as is the ability to hire allied factions in armies and outposts

neutral
 i didnt experience any major issues with performance on my rather old pc i can only play it on medium settings high to ultra settings in its predecessor but it runs smoothly here for the most part
 i cant currently evaluate the campaign mechanics as i havent progressed far enough for that the chaos portals however are currently a bit annoying it also feels like there is always a lot of time pressure right from the start

and now for the weaknesses
 by far the biggest problem for me are the minor settlement battles i was really looking forward to this since there was a lack of variety in the predecessor but ca missed the target the maps are huge and look great but currently they are unplayable there are so many bottlenecks and narrow alleys that units cant be positioned there are always blobs that completely block each other any kind of formation is impossible ranged units can barely be positioned and its completely unclear when they will or will not have a clear field of fire at all 90 of the time their line of fire is blocked 
 this is also related to the next point which is currently gamebreaking for me the pathfinding attack commands and also autoattacks of units are often broken especially in minor settlement battles units regularly lose their paths and targets yes i disbaled the guard mode sometimes they suddenly dont attack enemies anymore even if they are right in front of them for ranged units this is so severe that it becomes unplayable when barricades are suddenly set up and towers which are currently a bit too strong in my opinion keep shooting at the blobs the frustration is unbelievable in addition units block each other excessively often which makes the whole thing even crazier also other players experienced these problems the issue is discussed in the total war forum at the total war website   
 further what i dont like so far about kislev and what makes the point above even worse are the many hybrid units with these you can actually only go to close combat because the change between ranged and close combat in the cities does not work at all also the units lose their appeal when they are all hybrid the basic hybrid units dont feel any different than basic archers or ranged units from other factions in tw w2 high elves archers also engaged in melee with their swords and they were not labeled as hybrid before 
 overall the minor and major settlement battles feel very tedious and slow on the really huge maps of course this is amplified by the points mentioned above the limitation of the cameras zoom is also terrible here as you can only see rather small parts of the map and worst of all it feels like 7080 of my battles so far are minor settlement battles maybe 10 sieges of major settlements    
 at the same time i dont think that the supply system has improved player experience in the classic siege battles at the walls the defenders are still relatively helpless especially when it comes to enemy fire and destroying the walls also i think ive already experienced the old familiar gate bug once here a few bug fixes and some changes to the gate and wall mechanics would probably have been much better 

my conclusion the developers have listened to the fans and implemented some things that improve the game enormously compared to its predecessor i was fortunately not affected by the performance problems either nevertheless the problems regarding the game mechanics in the battles are game breaking for me not only do they completely kill the fun of the game they also lead to extremely poor battle outcomes even with the greatest superiority which increases the frustration even more the developers really need to fix the pathfinding and attacks otherwise it remains unplayable for me unfortunately even the mortal empires map wont change that 
poor developers nice ideas some good intentions but still a long long way to go however if these points are eventually fixed in one way or another and the sandbox campaign on the large combined map comes along then this game in combination with part one and two could make video game history

#####

conquer your daemons my ass theyre in my head

#####

one of the worst dlc schemes ive seen i enjoy the game play enough but there is an unbelievable amount of content locked behind paid dlc they charge you just for adding blood into the game a war game based on large scale battles that charges extra to see blood want to play as a faction that looks interesting need the  dlc want to use some of the cool units a faction has access to  need the right dlc

#####

okay im changing my mind this used to be a positive review

the game was fun you could see the worked somehow hard for making the game good

now they pump out overpriced dlc with updates that breaks the game even further half the features dont work and are missing from the game abilities in skill trees dont work as intended useless buffs for units that cant even use the buffs missing crucial units basically bugs that a competent developer would be able to fix in a week but no they have no intention of improving any of it 

they dont care about the game why should you dont reward them and buy the game there are better games

#####

in my experience with the game as a total newbie to the genre as i have no prior experience with other similar games it took hours or so for me to learn but once i did i enjoyed  it far more havent played on hard yet but won one campaing as festus and close to a second  victory as skarbrand

#####

crash  carsh  carsh  and even more bugs in patch 30 
when the game crashes after a 30minutes battle its so frustrating

#####

recommended  close to a 1000 hours of play this is a good game each faction has its unique flavour mechanic and play style  supports the modding community  repeatability is high beautiful in comparison to other similar titles and is better than what they are currently releasing it is very playable recommended upon the merits of the game

gripe  reason behind negative reviews they threatened the community and overcharged for a dlc the argument is a logical fallacy pay us more money for products or we wont continue making products i hate to break it to ca but you are a company that relies on consumers buying products for money quite rightly the community has responded to the outright toddler outcry of im bigger and better now therefore need more without producing better with taking them down a few pegs 



#####

every person who gave this game a positive review at launch deserves the bugs broken features and overpriced dlc

#####

disregarding the overpriced dlcs this is actually a pretty awesome game immortal empires feels like the buildup that the fans deserved seeing my dragons get shot by rats with miniguns and dinosaurs wreaking havoc on some poor dwarfs is extremely fun the sandbox elements are there and the player base seems healthy enough multiplayer needs some balancing and an actual ladder system instead of just rankings would be nice 
1010 will try to 100 achivements

#####

nobody will read my review so ill just say im gay

#####

let me start by saying the game is good if you buy this game you most likely will enjoy your first campaign if you enjoyed your first vortex campaign from game 2 they have added a bunch of qol improvements and changes that i find pleasing

the negative reviews are due to a few things which are legitimate like the bugs the lack of replayability and comparisons of this brand new game to the masterpiece that was the second game of the trilogy i felt the need to leave this review to give greater context to the negative reviews people are comparing this brand new game to game 2 which has had years of tweaks and dlc to flesh it out to its greatest potential game 3 is brand new no dlc other than the day 1 preorder bonus no mortal empires fresh bugs etc it is a bit unfair to compared game 3 at launch to game 2 at its peak game 2 at launch did not have mortal empires and only had a fraction of the playable raceslords available as they do now in time game 3 will likely surpass the popularity of 2 but it will take time for the devs to add in immortal empires sandbox mode new lordsfactions and patch bugs i do think this game was the best of the 3 on release day but wh2 with all the dlc and updates is currently the superior product unless youve played it to death and are bored of playing

the warhammer games rarely ever go on sale so i would suggest picking it up and enjoying a campaign or two now and when you get bored put it down until they come out with new updates especially the immortal empires update which is coming later this year that should add a bunch of replayability that currently isnt here for a lot of people who dislike the souls race and dont feel like installing any mods to remove that objective from the game the current factions already offer up a bunch of differing campaign mechanics to keep things fresh for me personally but your mileage may vary 

this game gets two thumbs up from me because i know it will get better over time like the first and second games did and i had fun with what they released on day 1

#####

i can no longer recommend this game in good faith due to the corrupt management at ca and their mishandling of a potentially great title none of you greedy scumbags deserve a single penny more i find it totally pathetic that the average tw modder is capable of creating higher quality content than what was released in the last botched dlc modders have passion ca has none 
youre in for an even ruder awakening if you think you can keep releasing abominable dlcs especially an empire one bye

#####

my financial decisions buying this game questionable
my tactical decisions playing this game also questionable

#####

wait 6 months for real experience 

its still shit

its still dog shit

#####

im absolutely blown away by how poorly optimized this game is i am currently 20 hours into this disaster so here is a brief rundown of my experience so far
 on day one i couldnt change my resolution to 2k i loaded the game into settings at 1080p but every time i tried to scale up it would crash to desktop when i finally managed to put the game into windowed mode and restart the game the it worked on the 3rd attempt benchmark tests on ultra preset had me around 54 fps on battle and 48 on campaign i dropped settings to high preset to help with this most of the day was spent playing for 3060 minutes crashing during alttab or randomly during battle loads or campaign turn changes

on day 2 i decided to optimize my nvidia settings for performance tweak my cpu and use a slew of recommendations i found online to help make the game more stable i did see minor increases in fps by lowering a few in game graphics settings but not enough apparently to give a consistant frames after hours spent i ended up scaling the resolution back to 1920x1080 now i was able to run the game at reasonable if not still inconsistant fps around 60 on campaign then day 3 reared its ugly head
on day 3 i started to make some serious headway in the game moving through the campaign pretty breezy with a few crashes to desktop now and then then the final boss fight for the daemon prince campaign after capturing the first tower the game froze moving toward the 2nd objective restart and try again 2nd attempt it crashes to desktop while holding the the 1st objective 5 minutes in dropped the graphics preset all the way down to low settings restart and try again managed to make the 3rd objective killed the shadow prince and while holding the final objective with 34 left to go it freezes again needless to say im stepping away from this train wreck 20 hours later and 60 poorer and i cant even finish the first campaign ive tried 

normally i dont mind a few tweaks to my system on day 1 releases im used to bugs and graphical errors from time to time but this is unacceptable when my rig far surpasses the recommended specs for a game i should never have to downgrade my resolution to make it playable  i use the term playable loosely because the last 3 days were anything but personally i dont care if its denuvo causing the issue or if it was simply not optimized for certain systems and hardware im not upgrading to windows 11 im not buying an rtx 3090 and im not playing on the lowest settings possible for the same results can you guess what else im not doing paying another dime into dlcs or buying another ca title until this mess is fixed

intel core i78700k 37ghz
nvidia gtx 1070 ti
16 gb ram
os windows 10 64bit

edit so i took a break got some dinner came back determined to beat this damn campaign went below the lowest settings actually swtiched off shadows antialiasing and ano filtering the game froze again at 36 during the final boss battle at that time i was showing 87 fps wtfh thanks ca for making me pay to beta test your game

#####

i bought the game on sale definitely not worth the full price the dlc price is outrageous  i like the game despite its flaws  it has the worst ai in almost any game i have ever played  armies running back and forth between their own settlements for 50 turns enemies ignoring 10 other factions they are at war with to attack you allies that do nothing except try and drag you into every war possible  

now neck and neck with paradox with the most disgusting dlc policy in gaming need to take a good hard look at baldurs gate 3 on delivering excellent complete games instead of focusing on greed

#####

i need mortal empire campaign i need karl franz i need to summon the elector counts pleaseee

love the daemon customization btw

#####

is the game better than warhammer ii at launch no

is the game still fun in its current state though yes

if the negative reviews are putting you off the game then wait until ca complete their current roadmap for the game

update game is much more complete now with immortal empires beta ca still working on balancing and adding new stuff definitely still worth playing and fun

#####

i love this game and i have spent hours modding it but ca has done nothing but break the game and make it harder to mod  each update adding new things that seems to make modding harder for no reason or changing mundane things that break every single portrait for no reason  why did you add no_culture when you had portraits done perfectly  why is the database tables constantly changed

ca isnt a small indie company there isnt an excuse that they cant fix bugs and make the game more fun for certain factions  i supported the game to be a full game not be a forever beta

due to the recent dlc i cant support it but if they change around and support the game i love i will recommend it again i dont want abandonware

#####

not yet the game still has a long road ahead of it i do not doubt it will reach the height that was total war warhammer 2 at the end of its life span i would wait for mortal empires to release by then we can hope the game is where it needs to be bare minimum

#####

edit patch 20 hey immortal empires is out and guess what you can buy the video game now without a giant pile of caveats finally its time to stop playing as uh kislev and time to start playing as all the factions you already liked playing in ii 

its a solid foundation with a lot of cool varied factions but the realms of chaos campaign gets old really fast and there are some technical issues that need to be fixed ive definitely had some fun with tw wh3 but its gonna be a much better game in a couple months when the combined map campaign arrives

if you have game pass its worth looking at there otherwise id advise waiting for a sale and a couple patches once immortal empires drops its going to absolutely be worth it but if you havent gotten this already youre fine waiting for a bit

what is the current status of tww iii 30 quite simple to describe shiny on the outside and rotten to the core but you have to take a closer look to see it which apparently not many are capable of

to be honest i have no problem with the price for me its about something completely different

for more than 5 months the numerous bugs havent really changed to the better at all in just under 5 hours with the new patch ive seen the same problems even worsened in some cases  especially in sieges holy shit  still invisible enemies the ai with completely stupid deployment in cities ungrim ironfists journeys end still doesnt work waaagh of orc ai factions in battles still not working pathfinding in sieges still incredibly bad still also it seems the performance on the campaign map has worsened again movement of the vampirates seems buggy also the rites of the vampirates frigg i dont want to list everything 

the dlc looks really good and great but if you put more resources into new stuff like the intel thing instead of fixing the old and known problemsbugs then i dont see the point in buying the dlc in fact i wont be buying any more dlc until something improves in terms of the endless bugs in my case the new stuff is not relevant right now

i encourage everyone here to reconsider their buying habits for gods sake stop preordering everything thats one of the reasons why the quality is getting worse every year

ca get your act together or this will be an even bigger shitfest than it already is as long as nothing changes i will not recommend the game

edit

as of today 08172023 nothing has fundamentally changed and holy shit todays official statement from ca  

i guess ill wait for the new patch 40 before updating the review

عملية التطوير وتحسين اللعبة بطيئة جدا بل تكاد تكون معدومة 
للأسف الاستديو خذل اللعبة واعلن عن حاجته عاما كاملا في خطته لتطويرها 
very slow development and improvement process 
and they said they need almost full year to fix and added content to this game 


#####

i regret buying this game spent over 70 dollars to get told that they are not making enough money

#####

nice but need immortal empire
now ie here and need other pokemons

#####

first off warhammer is amazing but how are you going to charge 25 bucks for a dlc that has half the contect that the chaos dwarfs hadalso 25 bucks dlcs like this upcoming one need to be back to like the 1015 range

#####

i still like bretonnia

#####

not sure why so many people are complaining it runs well introduces fun new factions and looks nice i just wish immortal empires was released immediately

#####

there are so many aspects of this game that are a pure improvement on its predecessor but so many more things that are just straight up broken right now or not fun to play at all it hurts to write this review because i really wanted this to have a successful launch but the single shitty race campaign several hard crashes and endless bugs some of which are admittedly hilarious really ruined it for me the faction mechanics their respective music and the super fun unit rosters are seriously incredible but theyre just impossible to enjoy this game will eventually be polished fun and complete but just dont buy it right now

#####

having played warhammer 1 and 2 it is true in my opinion that warhammer 3 has had a lackluster launch the races as they stand are interesting and fun to play for a while but their rosters are very limited i think this game will only get better over time with the release of both free lc such as mortal empires and dlc units if you are a fan of the series i would recommend buying this game and encouraging further development  if its your first warhammer total war game id start with warhammer 2 and hope by the time youve finished with it warhammer 3 will have improved

#####

this game is full of bugs it randomly makes you go to war with random factions once you hit turn 130 if you reload your game i have zero clue why it does this and when i go to my previous save files it automatically makes you go to war the buggiest piece of the shit game completely ruined my experience

#####

i didnt realize how much dlc the game has i was interested in the total war series because the warhammer lore is insanely lit so i just said fuck it and purchased the newest gameyou legit can play maybe 10 of the factions on top of that the 1st two iterations of total war are both much older and are still both 60 and are required for the factions that released with those games how is anyone supposed to get into this game when they didnt start playing since its inception absolutely the most cringe thing i have ever seen when it comes to entering a new franchise not only do you have to have the two previous total war games but you have to have the 10000 dlcs that accompany those as well if i wanted to just buy all of the content and play the game for the 1st time it would be like 1000 wtf is the thought process there i get a company trying to make money but how the fuck do you expect anyone to enjoy it when 90 of the game is locked behind massive paywalls i love the series and watch a lot of youtube content on total war it is sad to see that this is the reality of a game that has so much to offer it should be illegal what they are doing


edit i will say that i do enjoy the game and it is realy fun people saying u can buy the dlcs on other sites etcyeah i see that you can after researching it but how is that supposed to be common knowledge to new players the game is cool but the marketing is shit gg

#####

its good and plays well as intended dlc as usual is overpriced by 50 if not 75 of what it should be would like to see a warhammer 40k total war in the future

#####

let me just say this in full honesty this game is amazing and does each of the factions really well and i cant wait to see more of mortal empires but it has some glaring flaws that need to be fixed  

settlement battles 
this is the big one 
these were taken from other total war games and added to change things up a bit it does do that but it also doesnt work well with this franchise other games like three kingdoms your armies were mostly combat focused 
warhammer gives you a lot of options but most of the fun ones you want arent combat based armies like tzeench cathay kislev are mostly ranged or hybrid so suffer massively in these battles 
add on respawning towers and the fact that this covers 60 of your fighting it can start to feel really really oppressive and not fun at all its why i found myself autoresolving most of these even if i knew i could do better

#####

btl drb
if you are a veteran on the seriesb
while there are some issues at launch to save money buy now if you want to play this game before christmas the preorder bonus is worth it you can get an almost 10 usd discount following a link on zerkovichs youtube videos

bif you are new to total warb
buy now if you want to play this specific title with a friend otherwise buy an earlier game and wait wh2 is good for fantasy rome remastered or medeival 2 for nostalgia three kingdoms or rome ii for strategy

bperformanceb
this runs fairly well for me on a gtx 1660 super with ultra unit scales and fairly high graphics i have a ryzen cpu 3700 iirc it does help to have at least 16 gb of ram 8 minimum with a ssd do not buy if you use a regular hdd for games and have less than 16 gb ram

bgameplayb
mechanics available to the player have largely improved there are several glitches especially in hero v hero fights i often have to baby sit to make sure my character doesnt get distracted or disengage some of the key features of the main campaign are frustrating and unnecessarily punishing but i think some redesign will happen in patches the devs are well known for doing so

buib
there are some questionable or poorly thought out changes but things are overall positive additions to menus were largely positive some of the changes will disorient former players used to the old menus but its very survivable they need to fix the bright red on dark red color scheme in many areas

bturn timeb
turn time has improved

bmultiplayerb
2 person campaigns are stable cross platform play is possible cross platform and more than 2 person play can be very unstable

bpatch prognosisb
ca do fairly good long term support for games that dont completely bomb out this has definitely not bombed yet a large number of the negative reviews are from series regulars who want a polished game at release campaigns for this series usually take upwards of 20 hours when rushed with 12 factions on release it would take a tester a month to just finish a basic play through there are billions of combinations that need tested i dont feel that the release was unnecessarily rushed but i do understand the large number of bugs that still exist

bwhat i think could be done to improve the gameb

all factions a tutorialguide for their faction unique mechanics the help pages that are easily accessed say what exists they dont show how it works and several of my friends have misread or misunderstood the affects of their decisions

a guide to how resistances and damage types work i still am not sure if fire damage is blocked by physical resistance or not

moderate ai improvements are obviously needed

the player assist skirmish ai should not make protected missile troops run

siege equipment to help minor settlement assaults rams onagers cats mantlets

decrease background income by 1000 gpt increase income from most sources by 2533

more access to the magical damage type armor piercing is currently irrelevant when fighting most of the chaos factions

as cathay a detailed yinyang tutorial a ui showing the change to yinyang from buildings under construction or from confederating a faction some more abilities to increase melee damage output would be nice the infantry fights take forever and seem to be tankier than most dwarven units

as kislev  nobody needs to know the status of the orthodoxyice court if it does not affect them add an effect or remove the event window give them extra militia in some buildings to make up for not having the great bastion

chaos the gaps in the mono god rosters for slaanesh and nurgle are very noticeable a lack of shields and armor should be addressed across the board the uniform 20 physical resistance is boring some magical resist would be appropriate even though it is supposedly their weak spot for example with tzeench the blue horrors could have 20 missile resist 10 phys resist 10 mag resist 30 armor while exalted pink horrors could have 10  missile resist 30 physical resist 25 mag resist and 50 armor

#####

i nominated this for steams game of the year it really is something special now that the immortal empires campaign is playable there have been a lot of qol improvements since the 2nd game and some new mechanics of course the big thing that was new were the new campaigns which no one but me seemed to like but now that the big campaign is here everyone is happy

ive gone in depth on previous tww reviews on how perfect warhammer is for total war and i dont feel like going down that path again but these are two great franchises that were perfectly designed for one another and there are so many different factions and units that it seems there is always something new to do in the game ill be playing this for years to come as i did tww2

#####

this game is very good and the workshop full of mods for it makes the game x100 time better and it is crazy that the modders have added more free content since the games launch rather than the mulitmillion dollar company that runs this show 

the only thing i dislike is the amount of dlcs and how good units are locked behind them which is pretty annoying if you dont want to fork out hundreds of dollars on all these dlcs to unlock all the content of the game which btw some of these dlcs are a third of the price of the game itself but add not as much in comparison which is just blatant money gouging

but overall good game bad business and greedy corporate decisions made by game higher ups

#####

i played as the rats for the first time and was having a good time till my neighbors from beyond the mountains the wood elves decided im too stinky and destroyed everything i had

in the next campaign i destroyed everything they stand for and love and made their oak of ages into a lumberyard

fuck the wood elves

#####

these words are my personal opinion 

as a hardcore player of this game with around 1000 hours in this game minus the afks and accidentally leaving the game on overnights i would like bigger updates sooner  ive seen some discussions saying too many hotfixes could hurt the perception of the game but damn do i really want more fixes  i play it almost every day and see its errors constantly

i play this game often because i feel like the game is as the final installment of the trilogy like a book  the first time i played the first of this trilogy i felt and thought something unique and awesome  previously as a player of the total war series  a year later with the second installment i felt different feelings and thoughts  years later again i still felt different feelings and thoughts in the last game of the trilogy  ive put over 1600 hours into this trilogy once more minusing the afks

it must be incredibly hard to balance fun in this game  sometimes i want to rampage in a campaign and fight without reservation like skarbrand  other times i want to truthfully role play belegar ironhammer reclaiming my rightful hold that is karaz ankor karakeightpeaks  other times i want to play devils advocate and mastermind diplomacy between sovereign nations to ruin or growth high elves and tzeentch

i applaud the progress of the game but i yearn that it still has a future i want to play the game and imagine anew each time  year after year  i confess i am selfish and want more  give me sooner updates that are canon approved or at least near canon  why does khrone have a stance that increases the winds of magic  if the game is better tomorrow than it was today i will be happy take my money happy

#####

buggy unoptimized mess aside the game requires you to allow connections to epics online services i dont wish to have epic telemetry bs and im highly ideologically opposed to epic as a whole i dont care if its for cross play ill turn cross play off if thats the case if you do not allow these connections you cannot play online and cannot access your dlc including the preorder ogre campaign completely unacceptable

#####

greatest series of fantasystrategy games of all time unparalleled replayablity

#####

the best iteration of total war warhammer
is it well optimised hell no 
is it expensive yup
are there bugs yes plenty although i personally havent yet encountered any
however it is still a gigantic step up from what twwh2 was a lot of qol improvements and straight up upgrades makes this version really good the music is amazing the graphics and artistic direction is stunning at times the soundscape is to die for and there are hundreds of hours of enjoyment to be had here already prior to any dlc or addons of any kind 
the only criticism i can level at the game is next to the points starting out this review of course the awful ui although there are some improvements and qol overall the ui just doesnt mesh with the game aestehtic at all and is quite hard to read everything just looks the same also a chore for returning players because they just had to rearrange all the buttons for whatever reason the biggest letdown in this regard is the diplomacy menu which is just tiny square buttons with even tinier symbols and a bunch of numbers crammed into a small chunk of screen red on red whoever designed this should really check their eyes this is awful 

i hope the optimisation issues get addressed down the line

#####

for reference i have 1500ish hours in tww2

campaign

maybe im in the minority but i actually really like the campaign and changes to siege battles i like how the focus isnt on expanding but on diplomacy and making the right strategic choices at the right time do you go for the soul yourself or thwart the faction in the lead thematically and mechanically i find it superior to the vortex rifts offer up an interesting shake up that makes protecting your inner sanctum of settlements actually worthwhile i loved defending against demonic armies with a t3 defensive garrison and leveraging the reworked siege mechanics to win battles i would have been crushed in however i did find the survival battles to be extremely mentally fatiguing by wave 3 i lost all motivation to continue and just minimized the game overnight luckily you can auto resolve them without much consequence if they were 2 waves i think it would be just right 

changes
changes to diplomacy are extremely welcome the new system is a complete improvement in my opinion alliances are actually worth having and the complex network of alliances between other factions means you need to tread carefully when expanding this is a notably different experience than warhammer 2 where i just kept expanding thoughtlessly the supply lines rework is great and alleviates the reliance on doomstacks in warhammer 2 i had 1 army for as long as i could possibly manage now the threshold is much lower to make a smaller secondary force a host of user interface improvements are present as well the unit and spell encyclopedia is convenient to use and helps make informed decisions spells actually have stats showing damage and armor piercing values no more guessing how good magic is the quick deal feature on diplomacy is a godsend and eliminates tedium if you fight battles in a row with the same army the game remembers your deployment from the previous battle and saves you alot of time hero and lord traits for the most part are heavily nerfed from warhammer 2 which is something i prefer since it doesnt promote save scumming or a sense of loss when you dont get a good trait 

issues
there are numerous experience ruining bugs though like disbanding lords doesnt reduce upkeep docked ranged units dont fire etc luckily i have a high end pc but i have to turn resolution down and externally limit the fps to keep my gpu from melting unit pathing is pretty bad its especially awful with larger units especially ogres the chaos faction rosters are underwhelming extremely fun to use and a nice change of pace but very lacking in variety especially compared to warhammer 2 races who have had multiple dlcs of unit addons and regiments of renown all that said with the sure to be upcoming patches dlc and immortal empires i am positive that there will be nothing to complain about

#####

do not buy this if you dont already have warhammer ii and warhammer i more than half the races in the game are locked unless you have also purchased these titles

#####

kills me to write this review because im such a fan of the franchise and played wh2 a ridiculous amount i cant recommend this game it has some game breaking bugs that kill your campaign 60100 turns in with crashes it cannot be restarted to fix it frustrating we have begged the devs to fix these issues they said they would and they remain unaddressed 1 year later

#####

great game and will get only better with more lords and factions

#####

so far so good immortal empires is very fun yet unbalanced at times the bad stuff first
the ai doesnt really have any motives when declaring war at the player enemies blatantly avoid players armies and go for smaller undefended settlements some campaigns need a little rework for example the empire as karl franz or gelt the player should have better in game diplomacy settings and options while engaging in diplomacy with other elector counts for startes join war against option would be good confederations are a lot harder in wh3 now which makes the game grindier rather than harder the siege rework is sort of anticlimactic building towers in the middle of a battle does not seem approppriate for this game having to defend two defensive positions is just not good
the good stuff
the warriors of chaos rework is a major success new factions are unique and they all feel different to play i have always aligned with khorne who is the strongest in game chaos god in my opinion and skarbrand is a killing machine which makes the campaign amazing the map is vivid much better and clearer compared to wh2 the allience system is very refreshing they are taking steps in the right direction i believe this will become a very solid title in the forthcoming years

update its almost november ca managed to throw away all the good will of the loyal fanbase they had for years terrible management and childish reactions from the company is driving customers out of their games even me someone who holds warhammer fantasy very dearly they are banning users from steam forums for silly jokes that alone should tell the level of maturity ca has i have always rooted for ca even if the setting of their games was not in my interest the shitstorm that has been going on since the latest dlc shadows of change has been devastating for cas reputation sadly i dont recommend this game to a new player i did not rush to update my review because i gave them another chance which in hindsight i realise i should not have ca has taken their fanbase for granted since the release of warhammer 3 only way for them to at least gain some trust back from the players at least me is to nail thrones of decay and that is a big if considering their our costs are up approach
i still want this game to succeed but the ball is in cas hand now they either deliver properly with thrones of decay or we will see the future of warhammer 3 video in youtube post dlc release either way it is 100 on them

#####

i enjoy the franchise i find it really enjoyable tww2 i have 1500 hours logged in this one i have over 500 hours at time of review i can not recommend the game as it stands they need to get the dlc content up to par if the price they need is 25 which they have said they would but until that is shown through actions i would stay away if new to the game i also really dislike the following quote

the right to discuss is a privilege  it is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game
creative assembly 2023

until they get company values to be more customer service oriented just stay away its quite bad right now

will update to a positive review if i feel they have won me back as a fan of the company

#####

setting aside the politics of whats going on at ca and dlc cost etc etc ill get to that at the end  i simply dont like warhammer 3 as much as warhammer 2 

now perhaps its nostalgia and i didnt like warhammer 2 as much as the first game until the larger map with warhammer 1 factions came out  

i think im generally just less interested in all the demons and the factions which arent demons dont excite me as much and adding the full map didnt ignite the passion to play the game more for me this time around 

its a solid game and will provide entertainment my game play hasnt really been effected by bugs etc  i was just really hyped and i dont like it as much as i thought i would end of 

as for the politics  like almost everything in life the capacity for profit and the satisfaction of shareholders is more important than the end user or customer i have accepted it as the norm with almost every other aspect of life so why not gaming too

 there is no solution other than bloody revolution off with their heads and the end of capitalism 
since a civil uprising of the gamer seems unlikely a high percentage are too high to be bothered  i guess ill just have to deal with being ripped off and bullshit  such is life in 2023 it seems 
if you want this to change vote for someone who wants more even wealth distribution in society which i didnt as i was too busy playing warhammer 2 if you dont do that  its hard to have the moral high ground to complain

weirdly enough it run well on my 960 910 skulls for the skull throne

please make sure to rate this review so more people can find out is this game expansive w all of the dlcs heck yea but heres a nice quick solution for you guys theres this website called eneba and on there you can buy the trilogy for 46 in total by getting all three games you also unlock numerous free dlcs that come with each game all in a third one which is the one you should play anyways then if youre interested you can invest in a few other dlcs on the same store the ones id reccomend are champions of chaos chaos warriors rise of the tomb kings curse of the vampire coast and the queen and the crone total of another 45 or so this way you pay a little under a 100 pretty much for most that this game has to offer and can invest easily 100s of hours to gain return on time spent these specific dlcs that ive included should unlock most of the features that the game comes with as well as a bunch of factions and characters to play with

#####

so far so good cant wait for them to add 200 dlcs

#####

real time strategy game where orders you give are simply not followed through units get half way stop for no clear reason then stand around dying while you try and outmicro the ai this issue does not exist in any other total war title this is a new feature they added for twwh3 and renders the game near unplayable at the best of times it adds an element of you cant control your army to the game which is about as fun as being mugged

the ai never have this problem  in fact they have the opposite of this problem and can freely move without impediment even through your armies if the mood takes them in siege battles which are now a nightmare of overlapping narrow passages with zero opportunity to outflank or outmanoeuvre the enemy  just shoot and smash your way through them  this is a particular issue as the ai will blindly run through your armies to get to a specific area these web like mazes are a huge issue for pathing in general which is best described as rudimentary in this game

on the subject of siege battles trying to make them better than attack square city made of copypaste blocks they decided to dive off the deep end and add the ability to spawn whole towers in behind your army because this is what ca consider fun and intuitive gameplay adding them before the battle makes a lot of sense a dynamic defence that you can tailor to your opponents deployment after the battle starts makes no sense  how do you just build a tower behind an attacking army in seconds what the hell

add to this graphics that are no better than the last two games but run far worse constant crashes and general tw rocky launches and you have possibly the worst total war game ever made twwh2 was a masterpiece twwh3 is terrible

#####

nearly two years since release ca has done pretty damn close to nothing in terms of maintenance on this game 

its still a buggy shtshow and patches are less frequent than ever the worst part of all is i could let that slide because the game is still fun occasionally but now they are ramping up dlc prices to nearly double the cost of what they previously were and said dlc have less content than ever

until ca gives up this incessant greed  laziness im out

#####

incredible game for any strategy game lovers endless replay ability highly recommend

#####

the game isnt perfect there are areas to improve however this is almost a new game compared to how it was at the release of total war warhammer 3 its in a decent state generally gameplay and fun has only improved as post release development has happened the dlc is expensive to get the most out of it you at least should own the dlc for the factionsraces you enjoy the play of if it is a game 2 faction in ie it will cost you a bit i should assume by end of the dev phase of 3 it will be the same with a lot more factions

be aware of this before going in theres no way to test factions as dlc a try before you buy function and the price can add up however the gameplay is fun it has good visuals the over world campaign has a lot to do the ai needs a bit more work but even that is getting to a good point the dlc team as well consistently does good work if you enjoy total war or at the very least strategy this game has something to offer you

#####

btotal war warhammer iiib was one of the most anticipated games for me in the last years with over 1500 h spent in its predecessor i knew already that this game would be a musthave for me now i want to give my detailed review about the recently released last part of the trilogy build 100 i want to add that i solely focus on the campaign side of the game and not on custom battles also many points are meant as a comparision to total war warhammer ii

h1positiveh1
list
bprologue campaignb the prologue campaign is very well made it introduces the player to the story while explaining all the necessary basics and enables complete newcomers a good start into the series
bunique racesb all of the new races not only look extremely unique but also feature their own playstyle each with its own advantages and disadvantages
bdiplomacyb inspired by total war three kingdoms the new diplomacy system is now way more comprehensible for the player and offers new possibilities like the trading of settlements finally it is possible to declare raiding and trespassing factions on your territory war while breaking existing nonaggression pacts and trade agreements without receiving a diplomatic penalty
bmilitary alliancesb you can now see on the campaign map where your military allies plan to go and thanks to the new outpost mechanic you can help your allies to defend their major settlements as well as recruit some of their units to enhance your own roster the ai is also able to use this system which causes very interesting army compositions
bbattle mapsb the new battle maps are gigantic and extremely versatile land battles minor settlement battles and siege battles feel now way more epic the ai is also able to handle itself on the huge battlefields though this layout also puts a heavy focus on fast units and artillery furthermore reinforcements wont join the battle immediately instead it can be determined where they should spawn enabling more tactical planning
bdefensive supplies and capture pointsb the idea for the defender to construct barricades and towers with defensive supplies adds lots of variety to the battles on the other hand the attacker gets additional buffs for capturing certain points on the map to gain momentum as a compensation
bitems and ancillariesb low quality equipment can be fused or transformed into gold if not needed this helps to get rid of unwanted items and to keep the character window a bit cleaner
bgraphicsb the graphics are simply stunning lots of love and effort was put into the units and the environment from the blossoming lands of grand cathay up to the surreal realms of chaos the visual aspect of the game is outstanding compared to total war warhammer 2 the overall setting is a bit more grim which fits the narrative
bdifficultyb playing on very hardvery hard the campaign is challenging but not to the extent where it starts to get frustrating
bogresb one of the most anticipated and epic races finally made it into the game
list

h1neutralh1
list
bthe realms of chaos campaignb the campaign map is nicely made it really feels like you have to race against the other factions though when entering the chaos realms you have to spend lots of ressources time and troops while gaining nothing in return in the end there should definitely be some additional benefits for defeating the 4 demon princes because you have to invest a lot to do so so currently the game punishes you for progressing the story all in all it is still a big step forward compared to the eye of the vortex campaign of total war warhammer ii
boptimizationb the optimization of the game is currently in an acceptable state the battles themselves are very smooth and load quickly but on the campaign map you will sometimes encounter fps drops when finishingstarting a turn in 15 hours of gameplay i had only 1 ctd
list

h1negativeh1
list
bautoresolveb autoresolve is completely unbalanced on higher difficulties especially on higher difficulties you have to fight ridiculous battles manually because otherwise it will wipe half your army it doesnt make any sense that an attack of a full stack of ogres against 10 units of kislev would result in a valiant defeat as soon as you enter the battle map itself the balance of power bar looks way like it should i cant see a reason why the ai should get buffs for autoresolve additional to the already given difficulty buffs
bitems can be equipped immediatelyb while most of the possibilities to cheese were removed this allows you to transfer your best items from army to army and just use them in every single battle
bno respec buttonb wanted by the community for a long time the possibility to respec your lords and heroes whenever you want fe after a confederation was not introduced into the game i think ca has a reason not to do so but i am still a bit unsatisfied about this missing feature
list

h1in conclusion total war warhammer iii is a great game and the first hours were a blast for me but i have to state again that i was also a big fan of the other two parts of the trilogy currently i would rate the game with a 8590100 with a reasonable autoresolve an enhanced optimization and the introduction of the mortal empires campaign it will easily be a perfect game in my eyes


bedit after playing the game a bit longer seeing some of the patches as well as the road map i have to admit that my original rating of 8590100 was way too enthusiastic the developers had lots of time and ressources as well as experience thanks to tw w1 and tw w2  yet they delivered the game in a questionable state and the replayability of the current campaign is not so high so until immortal empires launches i would rather give this game a 6570100 ratingb

bedit#2 with the current version 212 of immortal empires i can revert to my original rating of 85100 while still being a bit unbalanced and the ai lacking bite compared to tw w2 the game is really enjoyable and better optimized compared to a few months before also the simultaneous turns feature works very well in multiplayer bh1

#####

destroy three enemy armies siege their capital so they have no recruitment buildings left they spawn a 2020 stack with multiple t3 units in a nearby settlement in a single turn on hard not legendary its annoying when the main challenge comes from how badly the ai cheats mods cant fix it and normal is too easy

#####

what is this game i ran into a bug in the prologue where i couldnt recruit the troops it asked for went to google and its been in the game as a bug since launch restarted the entire prologue got passed it recruited the frost mage and immediately hit another game breaking bug to where you cannot end your turn restarted for a third time got to the original bug where i cant recruit a korssarr and am stuck again please listen to the reviews this game has been out for 2 years there are multiple bug fix mods you can get from the workshop and even then it is entirely unplayable imagine being on turn 55 of your campaign and you just cant end your turn you would lose easily 4 hours of progress for no reason skip this game we need to stop paying aaa prices for literal unplayable games that wont let you progress past the prologue

blong review tldr at the endb

h1visuals and performanceh1
the game offers great visuals it runs smooth at max settings on my pc so far i got one random crash but some people with older hardware report more using alttab does crash the game often annoying but no big deal i notice no major framerate drops only a tiny drop if theres four full armies in battle normalizes after some units die

the prologue presentation is well done except you are forced to press buttons or watch ingame cutscenes where the camera moves all over the place before you can progress it distracts from an otherwise speckless prologue 

in terms of ui the demonickhorne red menu layout reminds me of a mobile game menu ultimately it workslooks ok and youll find total war elements where youd expect them to be

the model quality is great but what did catch my eye is that some units have odd animations for example kislev streltsi units will shoot an enemy and then crouch or stand still instead of reloading their gun you will hardly notice this though most animations are great

the game offers great graphics style and performance for my hardware but it lacks some polish for perfection

h1gameplayh1
b factionsb
i will not go in depth on each faction but we have kislev chaos demons the four main chaos factions ogre kindoms and cathay

considering that we are used to in mortal empires this feels like a meagre quantity but mortal empires was also added to twwh2 at a later time to see chaos collide with  binsert factionb we will have to wait for immortal empires

for now we can finish the campaignquest line for these factions for kislev it means taking relics of the primary four chaos factions to free ursun while politically stabilising your faction really kislev is an alternative russianthemed empire

b campaign summaryb
you can use chaos rifts that appear from events every x turns to move of course other factions can travel to you if you want to be safe you must close them they can also spawn chaos rebels its always a surprise if something heads your way rifts appear all across the map so you need to be ready to use both defensive and offensive armies you will find yourself at war on multiple fronts while you struggle between building faction mechanic or economic buildings

this time you cant make random demands in diplomacy this was prone to cheese in older tw games you make deals based on faction approval without the approval you need to balance the approval gap for example with gold before you can make a deal there are some deals where you can try to threaten the target faction risking approval drops if you cannot make a balanced offer  factions generally accept a deal as long as you have the required approval andor a balanced offer 
also you can trade settlements if you take settlements you dont need or dont want to defend you can give them to your proxybuffer allies perhaps even get one of theirs there are many fires to put out at once at the start of a campaign so having a defensive ally act as a proxybuffer will help 

other than that it has the usual campaign elements of a twwh game that dont warrant further review

b combatb
combat mechanics are largely unchanged ranged magic and lordhero units still dictate the course of battle the offensive power of frost and tzeentch magic impressed me but the way in which its used isnt new winds of magic regeneration is improved though

cavalry is still only useful for cycle charging or running down enemies they can still get stuck in multiple units in melee their speed is meaningless if they cant pull their own weight in damage and utility i only use cavalry as bait or to run down routing enemies

melee units are good to hold the line but youll never encounter any enemy for which the answer is not ranged magic or both instead you can still use fast unitsheroes as bait

the ai is not improved the ai fails to deal with cheese like corner camping ammo wasting and luring enemy units 
sieges changed a bit defenders can build ramps a la atilla and towers however on most maps attackers can still exploit blindspots the ai is never in control of a defensive siege

twwh3 hasnt taken steps up or down from twwh2 however the formula can get old 

1 there are mechanics that give penalties to your faction
2 you build to counter penalties while fighting off enemy attackers
3 your army bonuses become so good that the the ais only strategy of attacking you cannot work anymore thats the part where you start mopping up and stop caring

i still enjoy it but theres room for improvement humanity developed chess tournament winning ai yet we cant develop strategy game ai that can do more than spam armies and send them at the player but lose every battle to cheese

h1game opinionh1
there is a lack of polish and waiting for immortal empires makes the game currently feel like a teaser for itself mechanically it brings little new things to the table as a warhammer or tw game however i just want to see all fantasy warhammer factions in their full glory that this game does well i expect the same for immortal empires

this game is not the second coming of something holy but its one of the best pc games i played in recent years 

i didnt recommend twwh1 for a full price preorder because i did not approve of preorder schemes and an incomplete chaos faction i did not like all the twwh2 dlc however twwh3 is definitely worth my 60 because they get it thematically right and its a functional ejoyable total war game

h1opinion on chinese review bombingh1
from what i understand this is about keys being handed out some time before the official release to chinese streamers who are not warhammertw fans they spoiled the game for the chinese audience while longterm chinese fans had no opportunity to play it 
i can see it wasnt a great move by ca so i can sympathize but this means a lot of negative reviews are not submitted for an opinion on the game itself i dont think review bombing helps the community

the opinion on a game or developerpublisher can vary by localization and this isnt the first time maybe the positivity rating should be something you can filter by region so users can get more context on public reception
that said i do not think someone else receiving a key to play a game before you do makes for much of a negative review or should really affect your experiencecriticism of a game

h1tldrh1
the game is not the second coming of anything it does not revolutionize anything but its a great pc strategy game and a great addition to the twwh series chaos is thematically done really well and that alone is a reason for me to play this if you have doubts wait until the release of immortal empires

if you are chinese and are outraged by the streamer key situation write creative assembly an email but ffs review the game for the game

this is tale of modern gaming developers and publishers taking a beautifully welldone game clearly the product of equal parts passion and skill and slowly choking the promise and life out of it through corporate greed 

im not surprised it is everywhere today not just in gaming but what is so fascinating to me is that this same greed that is killing companies the world over could be sated by a few good consumerfocused decisions they could with a little hard work have their cake and eat it too 

i know what is happening the business side of the company made the determination that raising prices and reducing content ignoring bugs and focusing on new content is the most profitable and efficient method of doing business less work more money after all the company needs profit to survive but this model of thinking is grossly shortsighted i would ask the stakeholders of the company the following question 

which is preferred 

a 100 increase in profits in the next fiscal year from wh3 but due to horrific understanding of the consumer base the game dies on the vine and the player count and population of consumers of future content decreases to the point where it is no longer viable to continue supporting the game within two years

or

a slow increase of 10 profit per quarter over the next 5 fiscal years shoring up a rocksolid foundation of consumers who will loyally purchase every release of content for the entire lifecycle of the game additionally the community relations ensure that the next game in the franchise is eagerly anticipated and preordered continuing to grow the company exponentially 

everyone is picking the first option and not even considering the second even though longterm that would be the most profitable decision and the most welcomed by the consumer 

the problem is that the business side of the company does not understand how the money is made you do not succeed in business by spitting in the face of the customers who have spend hundreds of dollars on your products in the name of quarterly earnings if you do that you may not survive financially to see another quarter you succeed by doubling down on the things which made you successful in the first place attention to detail understanding your community and communicating openly with them and working tirelessly within your own company to produce a culture of fullspectrum consumerfocused effort rather than deadlinedriven content generation read bug fixes community engagement media and then quality dlc in equal measure rather than the current highprice lowcontent dlc rush 

it is a circle of growth the consumer sees what they want to see the consumer spends their money on the products the company produces the money is used to payroll the employees increase the wealth of the stakeholders and grow the company to produce more content in the same vein of what the consumer wants to see and so on and so forth

but enough of my own analysis if anyone from the company is reading this ill provide you some data points and you can do your own analysis i wont draw you any conclusions i wont tell you why i stopped playing but ill tell you a little about what matters most to you what i bought from the company and when exactly i stopped playing

i have purchased every single item in the total war warhammer franchise except the shadows of change dlc most i purchased at full price many i preordered 

as the time of this review i had 869 hours on record in whiii i had 5426 hours in wh2 

i own every single total war title in the franchise except thrones of britannia troy and pharaoh

i stopped playing whiii when i noticed that the animations for the witch hunter and free company militia they share the same animation set was completely broken this was a year ago now simply put their mouths do not open or move their pistols were floating magically from their belts to their hands when swapping from idles to attacks and eventually their swords were invisible despite being reported by multiple users on both steam and the forums it was never even added to the known issues list eventually a loweffort fix was pushed to bring the swords back and to shove the pistols into the offhand of the model but to this very day the grip of the pistol is horribly clipped into the thumb of the hand and nothing was done to address their broken mouth rig 

i purchased the forge of the chaos dwarfs but never played because the aforementioned bug wasnt addressed and once i had noticed my favorite hero unit from my favorite faction was broken it became too frustrating to ignore

i did not purchase shadows of change 

so there you go analyze away why might i have stopped playing could there by a linkage between terrible community relations and profit could seemingly minor cosmetic bugs really cause someone to stop playing could ignoring issues like that despite multiple reports and video evidence create a perception of not caring about the player base so powerful it drives decisions to purchase future content could it be after all this time the little things which create success could this really be what kills a multimillion dollar franchise

there are thousands of other players just like me if you can get my money i think everyone wins you included i wish you nothing but the best im rooting for you guys

#####

i have to write a prereview because some crybabies are giving the game downvotes for their own incompetence 

warhammer 2 was very good  warhammer 3 is awesome performce is way better and they finally improved the transition between map screen and character skill window not laggy anymore loading times are a little bit better than in wh2 

all in all i think that this game could be the best total war game ever

thanks bye

#####

tldr company uses scummy marketing practice tons of dlcs and theyre getting more pricey but game is great lots of fun all around although a much different experience from the historical titles

i i have over 1000 hours combined between the three total war warhammer games at the time of writing this review i

bthis is a game review b look i get it everyones pissed me included that ca is milking the crap out of this game but these reviews are supposed to talk about the game not the company right so if youre reading this keep in mind most reviews are just people angry with ca which again i totally understand and feel similar

so the game in itself i think is really great im not much of a fan of the other campaigns but immortal empire is still as much fun to me as it was in warhammer 2 for those new immortal empire means all the three games maps and factions are combined into one epic experience clashing and forging alliances and then backstabbing to paint the map in your colour 

the essence of what makes this game great are the big monsters clashing in epic battles where thousands of troops fight eachother as up to 40 units on each side are allowed on the field i love the unique gameplay most legendary lords bring to the table and the fact all the different factions have their own flavors and mechanics and sometimes differ wildy from one another as in ways their economy fonctions and what kind of troops they use and fighting style they must adapt to overcome their opponents 

they did change the sieging mechanics one of the biggest complaints from warhammer 2 which in my opinion is a very welcome change though it is true some less important major cities could use a bit of work i am otherwise a fan of what they made with the minor settlements i quite enjoy playing those another somewhat less important feature they added in this last game is the fact that now you can actually purchase units from other factions through alliances so if youve ever played some empire but also wanted to bring some dragons in your roster you just have to ally some elves

to me the graphics look great the sounds and music are good too i cant state enough how much i love watching the battlefield littered with dead bodies when the fight is over seeing where my enemies perished from artillery barrages or from towering monstrosities or even from some devastating spell casting 

i must admit im not one to play much in multiplayer pvp but i did play with one of my buddy in a couple of coop campaigns and honnestly it is really one of the best thing ever 

as stated earlier this game will require a bunch of dlcs for you to enjoy it to the fullest from this one and the previous games because they all sync together in immortal empires yes it is a lot of money but for my part ive been buying those here and there since the first game i would recommend waiting for those heavy franchise sales on steam to get the dlcs you really want first previous games and faction dlcs for example if im not mistaken you can still play a campaign and encounter every other faction in the game without owning their dlcs

as a side note another great thing for those of you who enjoy spicing up their games the modders community seems pretty great for this game lots of good work being done all around

i dont really write reviews but i thought this game deserved it as im seeing so many bad reviews lately i definitely missed some stuff but this game will probably stay as one of my favorite game of all time

#####

1010 addicted

edit definitley a great game to play as gateway into a new pc that is to say though that the main game dlc should not be priced as is with the little amount of content given and sometimes just very shallow experiences the games been out for 5 years guys the most expensive ones should be set similar to what they go on sale for would make way more and draw in a lot more people to the game if they realized this for the long run not forgetting if you want the full experience both previous versions of the game need to be purchased for the full total war experience that is painstakingly one of the main selling points of the game in which case both past versions are priced around 1025 on a regular and have far more content and thought put into those individual factions not that it was better then from what ive read

#####

almost every part of the game is gorgeous and delightful except the gameplay and ui

#####

enjoy chasing the ai around constantly as they force march and stay one pixel out of range

#####

i dont think ill ever be able to play another total war game because i dont think ca will ever be able to top what they created with warhammer iii and with every patch it becomes better and better ive collected all dlcs since warhammer 1 and intend to complete my collection as they are released
one of my gripes with the game is the dlc pricing the latest one was especially expensive

#####

ive been playing total war games for over twenty years and not much has changed setting sure some hero mechanics here and there fine make me make an account so i can be tracked but you give me some free dlcs fine too but when you charge me for a game and half the units in the default factions are locked behind a dlc yet also allow the ai to beat my ass with those same op dlc units i draw the line this isnt a game its an invitation to join a software subscription service avoid

in addition the balance in this game is absolutely horrible some factions are incredibly easy and must be played on impossible difficulty for any sort of challenge to be had and others cannot ever be won even on easy difficulty as with all twwarhammer games it requires mods to function both for game balance and because of game breaking bugs for a huge aaa game this game is absolute garbage

#####

a very good game not as good as warhammer 2 but you have more races to play and a bigger map on immortal empires i think if the devs some day fix the ai and the bugs it will be a better game then warhammer 2

#####

the market for this kind of game just makes me sad to keep the illusion of prices being what they were in the 1990s developers produce a fragment of a game and rely on user feedback over proper testing expensive dlc over content at launch its a risk management exercise and when the company acts the way ca have in face of criticism it doesnt give a reassuring feeling that the series has a future

which is a shame as i have 350 hours of play in this game to date as despite the above pressures that spoil the customer experience for so many as a game its very enjoyable the combat engine and ai run better than many other total war titles the campaigns and factions are varied in units and powers to give them a distinctive feel where balance is a bit messy such as perpetual waagh orc factions the clunky appearance of multiple free enemy army stacks to give an endgame challenge or the stupidly overpowered generals who can kill an entire army of 1000 enemies single handedly it still feels thematic

the maps get quite samey after a while in the early game as the factions are always placed in the same territories but they do evolve differently each time so by mid game you end up playing something different each time this is very appealing

not quite as appealing as brian blessed yelling gotrek quotes at you or watching all the colourful old world units still doing their thing in this unfortunate age of sigmar hope it ends soon

#####

waiting for immortal empire

#####

ive really enjoyed this series but i cant recommend this game despite it being its ultimate conclusion what should be every warhammer fans wet dream it just wouldnt fit my ethics to do so

to put concisely it just doesnt make sense to try and get into this series anymore at this point the way this games dlc works seems reasonable at first with none of it technically being required but this is just not true when we consider that even if you enjoyed only one faction if that faction wasnt in this game you are buying an entire other video game to play that faction in this game its a sort of nickle and diming that doesnt feel as bad to someone whose been playing all along but the barrier to having a full faction roster in 2023 for a new player is beyond reasonable this game is 60 dollars and then asks you to pay at least 60 more to play some of its most iconic factions to their fullest this is before we even get into how multiplayer adds extra pressure to this the base versions of every faction are inherently incomplete and far less viable in multiplayer if youre a skaven player youre buying two games and somewhere around three dlcs to play your whole army these expansion packs are another technically worth it sort of thing because beyond units they have unique campaigns but i just cant actually ask someone to do that 

to top it all off 3 is probably one of the least polished versions of the game to date rife with bugs and poor decision choices some of which that date back to the first game sieges are still not fun the unique smaller map campaign is still annoying to play if you bought the beastmen you still dont have the little mini campaign their dlc justifed its cost with from the first game the ai is still unacceptably easy to cheat against the strategic and empire building side of the game is still inferior to previous games unit balance is still unsatisfying and skewed towards certain monsters and ranged units and the new dlc model is the worst value and most toxic yet

shadows of change upped the scale of lord packs to three new subfactions rather than two alongside a massive price increase and its just not worth it interestingly enough having more factions involved makes it feel even worse because in this instance i only play one of the factions so if i wanted to play kislev to its fullest id have to go buy the most expensive dlc of its kind while only enjoying less than a third of its value warhammer 3 needs a serious cometojesus moment on its current model because its only good at leaching off of existing longterm customers and at this point its been this way so long i cant deny its at least mostly on purpose i dont think we started on this road on purpose or out of malice but we have had several opportunities to change course and still we go on at this point in warhammer 2s lifespan we were getting several entirely new factions including ones that were only ever described through lore and sidegames like the vampire coast 

what gets me is that not only is it bad value for the customer it feels like extra work for the devs making three subfactions instead of two means they now need to make three new entire systems and they now need to make one more massive big budget big dick box seller unit and its art assets which i feel is a massive amount of the time and money put into these packs becasue they do look amazing they all do this game is beautiful when the lighting doesnt mess it up so why waste that time and money and dedication making something worse that people feel bad paying for because theres just only so much any one person wants to spend on a single dlc pack

if youre a warhammer fan im sorry but dont tread here youll spend only slightly more money and make more friends collecting an actual army of minis and playing at your local game store

this game is still a buggy mess with unresponsive units units issuing their own orders and awefull siege maps that are copy pasted across factions after returning to this game now since launch 1 year i will yet again be returning to warhammer 2  a game i would heartilly recommned such a shame that the last episode in the series which was supposed to be a culmination of all previous titles is still such a mess i simply dont want to play it

#####

q3 for mortal empires map okay you guys deserve all the poor ratings you get  if it was that far out why was this released so soon  oh right  

your stock holders the real people you make games for

ultimately the game has alot of potential because it basically offers some qol improvements to the ui but thats about the only positive things i have to say here beyond the cool factor of the new factions  the mechanics of said new factions are fairly unrefined  for example cathys ying yang system which adds bonuses when theyre balanced adding points to each based upon building setup which is horribly tedious and irritating to say the least  if youre expanding rapidly for example it becomes annoying when you want to maximize it

i havent been on the game since it has been a very janky experience since its initial launch regretting my purchase as i shouldve waited for them to fix this mess  i couldve forgiven all of this if they released the large map for me and a friend i was very excited to spend time with on here and well q3  so i bought her and myself the game just to wait

ca is known to fix issues at a snails pace  this games predecessor it took months sometimes to fix bugs and the ai has been rife with problems on this and its previous game  this game though is especially bad with ai on that note the ai pathing for moving through city fights is outright broken with them somewhat fixing it i think not too long ago

dont get this game until end of this year at earliest youve been warned  a real shame

update 94  immortal empires is in rough shape  constant crashes awful pathing for units questionable balancing on confederation among other things and turns taking forever to go through at times due to huge slowdown of turn end means the experience is just not there  ca has had all this time and its in this state  if they want a good review from me the issues better be fixed sooner than later

oh and ps their hotfixes to respond to even crashes for example the crashes due to not accepting a threat to pay off a hostile faction has been there for weeks now  well done ca you guys cant even support the game well despite raking in this much money

update 108  stability fixes and core problems remain mostly unfixed  seems well get some critical fixes once per month  as said earlier do not buy unless on discount  ca does not deserve 60 usd for this mess especially with the money time and experience they have across this trilogy of games alone

update 2282023 the latest update has caused the game to be entirely unplayable crashing my game in the initial loadin for any game regardless if its a save or a new one this has been reported by many people across the technical forum as well and its amazing how the latest patch was allowed in to cause such a major issue
ca as usual shows just how incompetent they are

best game ever iii

#####

what is the situation
i started participating in the warhammer series since the beginning of warhammer 2 i preordered warhammer 3 since i was so excited for a big new game to have a comparison of performance i have added my pc specs at the end of the review so lets get on with the review i have split the review into several categories i have played the prologue and started a multiplayer cathay campaign with a friend of mine
performance is solely based on the fps and loading time 
gameplay glitches and bugs
content the new stuff

1 performance
i took notice that there has been a huge complaint about performanceoptimization issues however i can not relate to these problems even though my rig is not superior specs at the end of the review i can still easily play the game at medium graphics with 60 fps in battles but due to my game being installed on the hard drive loading times have gone up quite some bit i would approximate about 2 to 4 min loading time for transitioning from a battle to the campaign map and vise versa  i have not had the game crash on me yet

2 gameplay
at first glance there seem to be no issues whatsoever however over 6 hours of playing i did encounter a couple of odd things happen these are all in the category of annoying in my humble opinion 
grand cathay have the ability to use the ivory road to trade around the world during the travels of such a caravan many events can happen in my case i got ambushed by a small ogre army which would have been easily beat however due to bad luck when i clicked on fight a sudden second army joined due to this i lost my caravan the speculations are that at the location of the attack a second army was located that got dragged in to the fight 
during this ogre fight i encounter another weird possible bug when a wall of halberdiers were defending the frontline they seemed to be useless allow me to explain when a unit clashed with my static halberdiers half of that clashing unit was allowed to move through my entire unit without any trouble this caused my unit to be surrounded and my archers behind to be in trouble i can not say for certain if this is a bug or a new feature
flying units can not be ordered a flying unit to move above a unit it will always relocate your move order beyond the ground units this does not seem to bad until you are using units that have the ability to drop a bomb right beneath them this caused for a minor inconvenience where i had to fly the unit over the clashing armies and press backspace to hold the unit in the right place

3 content
the game has added a lot of new content to the total war warhammer franchise kislev grand cathay the chaos factions of tzeentch khorne slaanesh and nurgle and the ogre kingdoms i have yet to play the chaos or ogre kingdom factions however i have played grand cathay thus this review will be more focussed on the grand cathay features 

31 map
the game has also added more features to the game such as region trading quick deal in the diplomacy tab this greatly increases the efficiency of making diplomacy and prevents you from asking every faction for a trade agreement to which afterwards you are trying every possible money gift for the deal  to work only to find out that they were note interested in a deal after all instead you can see which factions might be interested in a particular deal and you can use the balance button to get or give the right amount of money to let the deal work they also implemented a better public order system this system stimulates growth on higher public order and reduces growth on negative public order

the multiplayer campaign mode is really neat to work with all the players work in the same turn to which it is possible to play with more than just 2 people if you have some moral in your group of friends than this system should work just fine basic rules such as first do all the management of your kingdom diplomacy building and recruiting and at the end make people move their units and attack this greatly reduces the time for each player to wait 

32 fights
the new map looks stunning and the new siege map mechanics are great instead of having a single wall that you have to climb which gets repetitive quite quick the siege maps are more stunning and usually have multiple sides to enter the city the defender has the ability to create barricades and towers before and during to fight this makes siege fights a lot more difficult and interesting to fight and the last very notable thing is that the ai has improved a lot an ai army with war hounds actually uses these hounds to properly flank you and take out your archers the ai is clever in scenarios where it might get a backup army after a couple of minutes instead of rushing in they move back to wait for the other backup army to meet them 

4 to conclude
the game certainly has a few bugs here and there but i would not say that these inconveniences outweigh the new content the games looks great even on medium has amazing new features and has made battles a lot more interesting due to the better ai and the reworked siege fights since they will still be updating the game a lot optimizing and bugglitch fixing i feel like they do not get enough credit for what an amazing game they have managed to make reviews saying that it has become normal to release games that are bugged beyond playing are lying through their teeth the game is not beyond playing some bugs just cause minor inconveniences
i am not implying that every bad comment on the game is unjustified i certainly believe that people have had major issues such as not getting the game to work beyond 20 fps and possible other issues however this is my perspective on the game after playing it for 6 hours just after release

5 my pc
it is an 8 year old pc that back in the day was quite high end however in these days not so much anymore
currently i run all my games on a 8 year old rig with the following specs
processor intel i54690k 35ghz quard core
graphics card geforce gtx 970 evga 4 gb gddr 5
motherboard ms h97 gaming 3
ram 8 gb ddr3 kingston hyperx savage hx318c9srk28

this is the kind of game i dreamed of as a kid pirates orcs vampires fighting each other 
i just wish i didnt have to have to buy so many dlcs to unlock everything just give me one or two really good expansions

#####

immortal empires means i never have to do the race to the bear again

h1 total war warhammer iii review the conclusion of the trilogyh1
real time 27 hours
note the game was played for 11 hours on steam and 16 on game pass xbox id nrhildija
need to be shorter to read 
feel free to scroll down to the conclusion and score given to the game 

h1introductionh1
total war warhammer iii is the final part of the trilogy of total war warhammer games bringing an epic finale that combines all three games into a massive scale on its own is an impressive title but it creates one kind of a titan when all three combine new mechanics keep the campaign interesting while a complete overhaul to its goals adds exciting divisions across multiple battlefronts from keeping walls secure with ration to battling demons in another dimension the expansive universe of warhammer comes unleashed in this entry

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2946251148

h1 discipline leads to victoryh1
the primary campaign of warhammer iii comes into play with new armies and gameplay elements to explore suppose you choose to play as a demon of chaos in that case you can build your monster with different body parts or if you go into the cathay race there is a need for balance to control the storm dragon the game rewards longterm planning for there are a lot of factions in play and early aggressiveness can lead to losing territories to everyone building armies focusing on a task at hand and preparing for the unexpected are necessary for a commander to win and expand their domain

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2946251307

with over 100 groups of enemies present action is always taking place in the realm from the scurrying skavens to the divided humans a good variety keeps you on your toes each faction has advantages that lead them to circumvent mechanics or bolster what they are good at the storys premise is that ursun the bear god of kislev is agonizing on the battlefield and the factions want to be the first ones to get to him from kislev trying to save him to demons thirsty to make him into the ultimate offering each run has its perspective that allows you to explore their setting

h1 i control tzeentchs gifts tooh1
the demonic dimension features reshaped gameplay as it changes the layout of the field there are now paths to take obstructions blocking advancing on certain fronts and points to control and hold to get ahead of the enemy furthermore each faction will suffer in chaos as they can take damage or be hampered in other ways there is a focus on the epic of warhammer iii tale as the cinematics deliver impact the gameplay pressures the player an army in the realm of demons cannot be in the overworld and there is a race to see who can get to ursun faster

armies have caveats too as slaneesh demons can seduce enemies to his side in battle khorne can spamfree armies when razing cathay can deliver goods and have other heroes join them or tzeentch can manipulate everyone and create havoc tzeentch in particular is incredibly fun to play as you can troll other factions with the changing of the ways it allows the player to give settlements to another coalition force rebellions break alliances or open the gates to a city warhammer iii has the most variety in its gameplay compared to previous entries which makes runs feel diverse and wondrous

h1 strong pointsh1
the game by itself is excellent giving a lot to offer in all of its entirety it is multiplayer where players can face each other in dominion and land battles to ascertain who is the ultimate commander if you own the previous games of total war warhammer i and ii you will get the factions from those titles and any dlc faction acquired from them holding all of them give the option to play a vast arrange of characters armies and units to use in the world of warhammer fantasy the prologue is an excellent way to get newcomers to understand the game in over five hours while the customization of the demons of chaos adds an rpg element to an rts title

h1sound replayability and bugsh1
the sound is fantastic featuring units making a lot of noise on the battlefield some to an incredible extent i am watching you nurgle the soundtrack as always makes the action and importance of battle resound through the lands characters are wellvoiceacted and i have to come clean here i enjoy hearing explosive spells casting and skavens speaking in their usual ratmen speech

the game itself has a lot of replayability in it if you combine it with the other two entries that replayability becomes insane add to that the multiplayer and mortal empires mode which features all factions in one campaign and you will never run out of content at the very least it warrants two campaign runs to experience different perspectives between races or mechanics between demons

there are minor bugs in the game as sometimes visuals can be inconsistent when battles start or a campaign might get stuck in turn thankfully autosaving makes most of the issues not a problem and they can be easily tolerable

the trilogy finally comes together into a massivescale game
demon realm battles and story quests are cinematic and exciting
tons of options and variety between the lords and armies mechanics

h1 conclusionh1
btotal war warhammer iiib is a stunning conclusion to a series of games that all come together it suffers from minor issues and a hefty price if one wants everything in one to go as a newcomer still it is perfectly playable while keeping those inclusions as to buy later list the entry adds a lot of new tones and flavor for veterans while being relatively friendly to newcomers making it a good pick for those who love strategic and management games is it worth picking it up if you own the previous entries you must get this one and complete the set if you are new to it there has never been a perfect spot to get included in the warhammer world

good
art
campaign
voice acting
lore
immersion

bad
no chat function
minimal to no support for multiplayer  literally a broken leaderboard no season rewards no prizes no integrated tournaments no way of knowing if the people in you lobby are lagging prior to starting match
user interface is piss poor
debug cam should be default the regular battle cam is terrible to use


#####

best of the trilogy only negative sides are that the older races dont have really any play value as they really dont have any of the features for example dwarfs could have the caravan system or something like that and the second negative is that the new races like all the chaos demons are op af they just start stomping on turn 10 and if you are on the way well good luck but i love the game in every other aspect

#####

personally i like it but there needs to be more transparency to new players how much money everything cost other than just the game i own all dlcs but a new player could be forgiven for thinking the game is only 60 and then be shocked to learn that 99 of the content is locked behind dlc paywalls that easily reaches hundreds more dollars base game should be free with how little comparatively is included its definitely not worth 60
