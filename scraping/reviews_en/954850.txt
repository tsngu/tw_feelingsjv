just wait theres a diamond in the rough but there is a lot of rough

14nov2023 edit i havent been able to refund the game due to having more than 2 hours of playtime if i could i would have refunded it has been a very quiet year with not a lot to show for it disappointing and a shame i cant have my money back

#####

im updating this as its now been 7 months since early release nothing of note has changed

i have 1400 hours on ksp1 love it
i do not recommend ksp2 early access in its current state

why this early access is important
this is not the same team or company that made ksp1
the ksp ip was bought by private division and is now owned by take two interactive
private division has asked take two for more funding to develop the game take two denied it
the result is private division releasing this minimum viable product sold at premium price to cover ongoing development costs

what this means
do not defend this under the idea that ksp1 became a smash hit it shares nothing with it
do not assume anything positive or negative about the capability of the team to succeed or fail
do not assume that take two will treat this any differently than any of its other licensed titles

this is a netnew initiative treat it like it is
you are paying 50 for an early access
you are buying a promise from a new team run by a large detached corporation
there are concerns

i will update my recommendation once it feels beneficial but at this time i do not recommend it
their are prolific game breaking bugs very minimal content and frustrating mechanics
while 50 may not be a big deal funding this type of practice should be a consideration and what you expect from your money spend as you will

#####

as of the science update i am happy to report that i am finally enjoying this game the framerates have vastly improved though i havent had a chance to build anything larger than a mun rocket and the wobbley rockets are a thing of the past the science mode finally gives me a sense of progression in the game and the way that they blended the career mode quests with the science mode works really well in my opinion it does a good job of guiding new players in what to do next if you were holding off on buying this game i actually recommend it now sure it still feels like an early access game but now the difference is there is actually a game to play instead of a vessel builder well done devs and keep up the hard work you are showing your community that this game isnt a greedy cash grab and that you can deliver on roadmap objectives

#####

development hell avoid

two different developers three years of delays four months since launch and only three patches they still havent fixed the most glaring performance issues that have been plaguing people since launch while the devs have been pretty open with what they are working on and havent really hid or lied about anything it boggles my mind why it was released this early on in development and for that price the launch song things can only get better hit the nail on the head because it couldnt possibly get any worse then the state its in now

edit i really wanted to hate the for science update but its a pretty solid update still a bit rough but its heading in the right direction if they push another update like that and continue to fix issues ill change this review to a recommend till then your better off playing ksp1

#####

dont buy the game i put in over 5000 hours on ksp 1 and it was amazing this is a tech demo masquerading as an alpha for the price of an aaa game it has about 10 of the features of ksp 1 and not one new feature promised during three years of development and its not fun and mostly not playable the videos on the store page are all cgi made and does not reflect actual game play in any way at all seriously its nothing like the videos on the store page people with 3080ti gpus cannot run this game they made a dev post in which the the lead qa guy explained that he had never played ksp 1 and only has experience working on mobile games for amazon please tell me guys do you play amazon mobile games did you even knew they existed cause i didnt the dev team also made a post in which they blamed the community for the outrage at the obvious scam there have going on here they have slowed down their update cadence only a few months after release on early access not only have updates slowed to a crawl all they can manage to do is fix three or four bugs and give us some low res models for new engines nothing like the videos i am convinced that the devs dont actually know how to develop a game and the qa team doesnt actually know how to find bugs remember this game was announced in 2019 was slated for early 2020 before march before covid then they blamed covid for not being able to develop a game which is weird cause i can program at home why cant you but anyway 4 years since announcement and this is barely a tech demo something you would show to the company to show proof of concept and get your project funded i left it open a while before actually trying to play so no refund for me dont buy this game just take your time and get all the things this game promised on ksp 1 with the amazing modding community

#####

lets just do a little timeline of events

201718  development must have started
2019  cinematic release trailer posted promising a 2020 full release i must stress this it was to be a fully released game in 2020
2020  delayed to 2021 fair enough covid was a pain
2021  delayed to fy22 
2022  announced for 2023 as early access

what we were advertised initially was a full game to be released in 2020 what we got was not even a 6th of the game 3 years late 56yrs in development in an early access state paid for at a the price of fully released triple a games more than the price of ksp1 plus both dlc packs but coming with less features than ksp1

the current state of the game is similar to ksp1 v019 back in 2013 when ksp1 was 23 and receiving updates almost every month mean whilst ksp2 has been out for now 7 months and has received 3 updates and 2 hot fixes which have not added any features

the worst thing about this game is what it did to my motivation to play the origional i stopped playing ksp1 as much with the announcement of ksp2s eventual release date as i was looking forward to playing what i and i think most people also expected to essentially be ksp1 as it was but with better graphics sound design and a better both in accuracy and performance physics engine but no what was released has questionable graphics some better some worse and uses the exact same physics engine with the exact same bugs that were in ksp1 but were dealt with by fixes and features that are missing from the current game despite being promised by the devs that features such as autostrut would be present at launch to the content creators when told about how critical it was at a content creator event in advance of the launch

youll notice i missed out any comments on the sound design thats because it is the one thing that has been done categorically better than ksp1 without fail the guys doing sound design at ig are awesome and honestly wasting there talents on ksp2 would be far better to have a paid dlc for ksp1 porting over that sounb design for engines and music

tldr
dont buy if you love and still play ksp1 it will ruin your motivation to play a game you love
ps
ig please go do a music and sfx dlc for ksp1 i will give you money

#####

i loved the original ksp and got a lot of decent time in with this one i think ill probably sink a few hundred hours in i love space games and newtonian physicals models i also have a high tolerance for early access games i dont think the typical user will enjoy playing this yet so i cant recommend it i hope that changes but its hard to understand such a large step back

i dont want to just negatively review and move on devs i hope the following can be helpful and that the points i raise are constructive since this is an alpha consider this the results of my alpha testing this list is nonexhaustive i have actually run out of space in the review

ranked vaguely in order of most annoying

 parachutes have a 25ish chance to fail to deploy this has nothing to do with any mechanic if you revert the save they might work this time or they might not

 attempting to edit a maneuver node and the process of intercepting is extremely frustrating there are so many layers to this issue from bugs to opinionated design choices to farthestfromoptimal action flow

 the game simply will not allow you to use the marker system if you are out of fuel it will also not allow you to expand markers past where you would run out of fuel the issue is its only counting the fuel in your current stage got leftover fuel in a stage you want to use ditch it its not worth losing the ability to plot your next course lol this is one of the most annoying things in this game and its an intended feature not a bug if you cant make it to your destination on one stage youre going to have to burn halfway and hope you eyeballed it well enough that your next stage isnt going to have to throw away a crapload of fuel fixing your imprecision 

 you cannot create or modify a course marker while the game is paused again this is a feature and not a bug for some reason 

aside nasa has all their maneuvers calculated months before the launch it gets programmed into a computerthe engineers sit back and drink coffee while the telemetry comes in you can use an orrery to see where celestial bodies will be years and years from now youre really not going to let me take a twominute timeout to adhoc my next step in the process of getting to another planet i need momentum to even plot my first course which means i cant take a first swing at figuring out what my plan is until i have an orbit ive thought about using a dummy payload in orbit of kerbin to plot a course before i launch but that would mean doing it all twice with the horrible course plotting experience and the dummy payload would need a stupid amount of deltav just to let me use the marker system to plan a route anywhere interesting

 toggling timewarp too quickly will cause the game to lose track of its state ie the game will report time is paused while time is actually at 14x speed this issue compounds the previously mentioned feature where you cant plot courses while paused or even modify the thrust you have set its great hurling towards a planet at high speed essentially shaking the soda machine in a panic trying to get it back into the working condition

 any ships you have in a given sphere of influence will supersede it on the minimap and you cannot target or focus the celestial body without a really annoying 10 second scroll session or 10ish clicks you literally have to press your face against the planet to target it devs you can assume that if i am looking at the star map from location a controlling a vehicle there that i do not want information about vehicles at location b my camera is literally a billion kilometres away from those guys if i want to see them i can scroll in its infinitely more likely that i want to click on the planet so i that i can plot a course to it just dont show the markers for these other ships unless my camera is at their perspective ie ship in low duna orbit should not be visible much less overriding its parent body from interstellar distances the camera views the kerbol system from

 minimap elements become distorted and overlap other elements of the map

 inconsistent course markers on the map view showing jittery distances despite an unobstructed course making it impossible to accurately plot

 it is very difficult to plot small changes 3 delta v you are better off guessing and checking with an engine set to 1 thrust limiter fishing for the course that will reduce your apogee manually this is inefficient and time consuming and it would be great to have the game do a little more to help you when you need a precise course change

 game will incorrectly report your current deltav or overall deltav on a variety of different screens and interfaces 

 course information will sometimes jitter and the game will report your perigee over a range of several kilometers i see it most on a course from one planet to another this makes it impossible to reliably set a course to aerobrake

 rotating parts in the vab using wasdqe sometimes makes them unplacable on snap points

 staging often requires two clicks or spacebar presses leading to a profound sense of dread wondering if this is the one where your rocket snaps in half and disintegrates because you staged twice

 my last rocket was fairly excessive but i was trying to get a payload of three vessels to juul it had 33 engines firing on the first stage all small  medium parts since thats where i was in the career mode it might have been a stretch doing so much at once but the game lets me and it gave me the mission to get there knowing my constraints anyway staging 12 srbs at a time my game would drop to 0 fps for 510 seconds literally no information from the display except whatever still image it landed on then eventually time would resume and the boosters begin to fall away

 debris sometimes becomes stuck midair above the space center only a few km in the air i believe i have hit this derbies several times but its hard to tell with the lag happening up there the debris sits at the altitude where i do my firstsecond stage i think the game just gives up on the physics for spent fuel tanks  

 no way to filter debris off the map besides manually destroying each piece you leave behind at the tracking station

 test a fairing on the pad before you rely on it to release the payload trust me the system is not very intuitive and you cannot imagine my saddness watching a stillfullyencapsulated probe drifting away from my ship and having no way whatsoever to release it

 you will sometimes be unable to move or maneuver a ship that should be fully controllable forcing a restart of the game

 my game has only ever alttabbed without crashing once this is not an exaggeration

 ultrawide and 4k resolutions not supported natively

 parts have no associated monetary cost making the objectives in career mode feel a little bit lackluster i can get anywhere if you let me use as many parts as i want id recommend giving the user a money slider from infinite to soviet in order to add a layer of difficulty tailored to the individuals preferences

summary the bugs combine to make an incredibly frustrating experience bugs and game design choices amplify each other

career mode is cooler than ksp1 lots of potential in the game just really a lot of technical debt to get through and obviously since the game is feature incomplete it will continue to be unstable for some time into the future i think the devs can one day succeed at making kerbal more accessible im having a lot more fun playing campaign so far i think the story theyre putting together is cute and they did a great job capturing the character of the original game there are some great qol improvements like the ability to quickly set a course via button press speed up time to markers and plenty more hoping for good things

#####

okay so ill be updating this review  i hope 

h1time played 2 hrsh1

first reaction is sticker shock there are a iloti of promises made and if those features were available right now that price would probably be worth it at it is in early access 50 is asking for quite a bit when were getting a game that could easily be done in the original game with some mods obviously im hoping for greatness but that 50 price at early access is going to make a lot of people walk

second reaction is the launcher private division for some reason has a separate launcher that they clearly want us to create yet another login for this extraneous bit of nonsense never fails to piss me off guys were launching from steam your launcher can tell we launched the game from steam

im iguessingi that theyre hoping to make this extra launcher a mod hub or something maybe something to do with multiplayer even if true it grinds my gears something fierce especially if theyre looking to force us to log into this thing to access those features

third reaction is at the eula browse it at take2gamescomeula  now i get that nobody actually reads these complete garbage cans but i did take a peak at a few terms and wow is this one ready to throw you to the ground and start at you without lube if you manage to break the terms first up is all of this will be done using new york legal code which is kind of famous for all the wrong reasons secondly you can expect to see arbitration not a jury  that we can wave a right to actual trial like this is still bs  for those of you who dont know arbitration is legal code for the company wins because the arbitrator is rewarded  paid  for favoring them because the arbitrator will get more cases if they favor the company i dont expect any of that to actually happen but it does go to show the prevailing mindset in the developers studio

there is a iheftyi section on in game currency and purchases so we may very well be subjected to microtransactions or other garbage

modders you will not be able to make any money from your creations no surprise but it goes further basically if you create a mod you do not own it at all for those unaware back in the day there was an rts game called warcraft 3 it was immensely popular one of the reasons for this popularity was the incredible freedom that modders had to create custom maps eventually a collection of maps called defense of the ancients became a significant percentage of all wc3 online games defense of the ancients would be so popular that those guys would go on to make a separate gameand lots of cash theres drama and more to the story but the important bit is that blizzard  the makers of wc3  were upset they didnt get that money and decided that any mods to their game was theirs and nobody had legal right to any of it

so tldr for modding dont expect to be able to take any code or ideas you create and profit from them

also in the terms allows for them to spy on you and sell your data so you know theres that

fourth the limits of early access a lot of players will be immensely disappointed to learn that the only game mode available is sandbox and a limited sandbox at that hopefully science and campaign will come soon but im not really a sandbox guy so ill be waiting for it

and finally the gameplay the tutorials were nice graphics are better but hopefully something that can be improved im not really aware of physics engines to comment overall the rocket builder worked nicely there were a number of small ui improvements that were quite nice all through out the process everything was similar enough to the old ksp that adapting wasnt difficult and the improvements were overall just that improvements

getting into orbit of the mun was no trouble and the ui changes to show where you entered the sphere of influence were great

two hours play conclusionim really let down i mean the long wait time  years  ending in an early access release the sticker shock the launcher the eula especially the spying

at present i dont recommend this game maybe they will actually deliver on those rather grandiose promises maybe but honestly im tired of bipayingib for a product that spies on me for people to sell my personal information all over the world im just really tired of it and people say things like you dont have to play or similar but damn near every digital product has that in the eula damn near every one and what does that say about the culture of the owners of all of these businesses not good its just not good

the original ksp was so wildly fun because of the freedom im not entirely sure what freedom this eula and company culture gives us

h1time played 34 hrsh1

okay so first things first i opened up comments earlier today i had no idea this review would explode so feel free to comment away

i would also like to mention that i was able to play the game with out setting up an account on the launcher so theres that

after hearing a lot of complaints about the graphics i did some testing for reference i have a 12700k cpu a 3070ti gpu and 64 gb of ddr5 ram  please be kind im an amateur at this 

gpu temperature never peaked beyond 70c with fans at 60
cpu temperature peaked at 60c with fans around 50
ram usage peaked at 19gb

after idling the pc my resting temperatures seem to be about 1015c below the game running temp

interestingly the monitor says the gpu load was complete maxed out same with gpu memory i fiddled with the settings a fair bit while in high orbit my fps was mostly the same around 27 fps at native 3840x2160 resolution when i scaled back the settings to the low preset i averaged 33 fps decreasing the resolution allowed me to hit the low 40s fps

obviously there is going to have to be some serious optimization for this thing to work

h1time played 5 hrsh1

okay so ive really been playing around with the settings trying to get that fps i noticed that the recommended pc requirements was only at 1440p so i tried that andit didnt change much regardless of what settings and resolution the game tended to average mid 20s fps higher settings and resolution tended to have lower peaks and valleys lower resolution would give me a higher resting fps up to the 40s but when in action it would dip back to 25 or so

throughout all of this my log says the gpu was used at capacity but the fans really didnt start blasting so theres clearly isomethingi going on the game is playable at 25 fps its just not as enjoyable as it could be

im going to give the game a break and keep an eye out for updates

oh and to all the haters out there saying this is a cash grab and dropim aiming towards no its not that theres a pretty good music score going on and a bunch of small details  expanding fuel tanks and more  that would be pretty pointless to put in for a mere cash grab so for all the  many  faults im pretty sure theyre not just here for that

h1time played 61 hrsh1
h2patch 1h2

significant improvements in fps i havent gone through detailed analysis but there was a giant jump in performance in a few areas anytime kerbin was in view while in orbit the fps went strait into the dumpster but the mun was great

still a number of bugs i landed on the mun in my mid stage landing gears on next stage so i decided to save before i did anything else

first bug happened after i planted the flag and couldnt move for some reason reloading caused me to fall through the ground so plenty of bugs still

take away is pretty good for performance improvements any changes to the eula will probably have to wait until final release  if ever lets hope 

ill check in for the next patch

#####

tldr dont buy it yet 

i have been playing ksp1 for years i think ive logged close to 300 hours it has always been one of my favorite games to come back to time and time again seeing as i went to school for aerospace engineering i am drawn to rocket stuff so like all of us i have been waiting eagerly for ksp2 to come along 

thoughts and opinions
graphics look great runs like shit expected i have 3060ti and only broke 60fps outside kerbin atmosphere or in vab
sound design is wicked cool the vab the rocket engines the menus all of it sounds fucking awesome 
vehicle assembly mechanics are 610 some great qualityoflife changes like trip planner but also very buggy and annoying to keep cooperating actually had to step away for a minute after getting frustrated with fairings and i am not new to this
flight is okay not too many unique complaints here felt a bit sluggish but hey i built a fucken heifer maybe
landing was fine nothing special or new here that i saw
eva was broken as fuck

bugs i experienced
vehicle stability outside the vab was very funky every largescale rocket i made seemed to be much floppier and flexible than ive seen in ksp1
while setting up a stable munar orbit i found that even when sas and rcs disabled entirely my apoapsis and periapsis would change up to 7 thousand meters i found this completely unacceptable i actually tested this too i set up a munar orbit of eccentricity  1k meters i disabled my engines sas and rcs and walked away and made dinner when i came back i found my orbit had changed to about  8k meters
 maneuvers are busted there were so many issues i found with it maneuver burn timer is broken as fuck it has you start your orbital injection burns after you pass your apoapsis 
i landed on the mun and my kerbal literally got bugged in eva on the surface i couldnt move at all and had to revert flight 

and then i exited the game and started this review 

dont get me wrong the development team made me well aware there would be little content to play with and a very poorly optimized experience i for some reason didnt think it would be 50 bucks but im a big fan so it was fine too if that was the end of the story id still probably be happy 

what makes this a nogo for me at least until they make some serious fixes and updates is all the bugs in the gameplay it was riddled with them its playable but an ongoing battle you fight against the games mechanics to keep going i actually think im about to go load up ksp 1 so i dont completely lose faith because this was a seriously disheartening experience that received so much hype really let down and im trying to keep hope that this is just a really really really early version of this game i just hope the fixes come quick and often


#####

scam

6 months later and not only is nothing from the roadmap completed there isnt even an estimated delivery date

this whole thing stinks like a scam all the budget went on marketing and promotion campaigns so they could shift as much of their shit game and recoop as much of their investment as possible while leaving a skeleton crew behind to maintain the appearance that things are still happening

seriously 6 months of nothing but bug fixes for a still broken game
promised science nothing
promised colonies nothing
promised multiplayer nothing
promised interstellar nothing
promised a game nothing

ive never had such a sour taste in my mouth from any game to everyone involved in this scam from the bottom of my heart fuck you

#####

it isnt ready yet  even after a year the bugs are too much  its improving and someday may be great  but not yet  
i love ksp1 2000 hrs  but hold on to your money until this one is done

#####

the about this game section says it all with 80 of it being key features bto comeb during ea  youre not buying a game youre investing in something that is still being worked on a lot of the core mechanics even parts are still not in the game and all patches usince ea launchu 4 months ago have been bug fixes and theyve only just made a dent

i love ksp and would actually be ok to do this for ksp2 but the amount of missed deadlines and overhyped content strongly suggests a disconnect between the devs and the marketing department something which historically in game dev doesnt bode well 

i breallyb hope im wrong and that ksp2 turns out great but im not going to throw away 45 just in hopes of that hold off is my suggestion but keep an ear out on youtube or similar to see the rate of progress

#####

give er 7 months 3 days and 40 minutes and 47 seconds then buy it

#####

kerbal space program was the perfect example of why early access should have worked ksp2 is the perfect example of why early access doesnt work early access was meant to deploy a mostly functional product in order to get community feedback for final polishing it has since been warped into a quick cash grab by people releasing barely functional games and hoping they can make the money before their product is any good
  ksp2 isnt an early access game its a company that got too full of itself charging you 50 for what should be a free open beta very little works properly
 the vab is glitchy as heck symmetry is iffy and the camera will randomly jump to another position when youre just trying to pan up or down a bit
 electric charge doesnt seem to be working  draining
 i reentered sideways to get a feel for heat management no reentry fire effects no explosions nothing i just skidded through the air all the way down to parachute deployment until
 i reverted to launch and tried again at about 60km the ship suddenly popped out of existence no explosion that i could see  hear and the flight log came up saying i reentered too fast and burned up

i could go on and on having experienced a weeks worth of bugs in under 2 hours the graphics are iffy the performance is horrible even on my 3090 at 1920x1080 the physics feel off the airplane sas wobbles like a dog shaking off water staging will sometimes do 2 stages with a single activation basically stuff that should have been fixed barely out of alpha

i am sooo disappointed with the devs for this i was super excited for ksp2 after putting a bazillion hours into ksp1 i was willing to keep the game and endure some lack of content and a few funny bugs to support the developer and wait as they fixed the last bits not after seeing this atrocity i am getting a refund and now not only have they ruined my excitement they have probably ensured that i will not rebuy their game even after its fixed or support them in their other projects

 and theres another fking launcher app why i got the game on steam i launch it through steam i have steam and epic and origin and ubi and battlenet i do not need another gorram game distribution app

#####

to get full nasa experience you also should get nasa pc

#####

holy crap  i waited for two patches and i was skeptical the game was as buggy as it was being made out to be  i mean look its ksp theres fun to be had in that  right  well i didnt even get to launching a rocket because the vab symmetry quite simply didnt work  things would just not get placed with proper symmetry despite placing and replacing them  then there was other placement and clicking bugs and its just  well its a tough pill to swallow  i mean were not talking early access here in the sense of like oh content is missing  were talking early access as in basic functionality of the game isnt done yet  ill keep my fingers crossed but if you were hoping to squeeze some kerbaltastic fun out of this one its going to be a roll of the dice

im willing to have confidence the developers have the skills to turn this around but i cant in good conscience say i can recommend it in its current state

#####

ksp1player sinceone of the early alphas quite a while before steamrelease  and never transferred the game account to steam  

did i expect ksp2 to be final no
did i expect performance issues  yes
did i expect bugs   sure
did i expect an in every way completely unfinished developer techdemo that isnt really playable  not so much
did i expect a flood of uibugs disintegrating ships as soon as i approach them random orbits hell not

at this stage even participating and trying to give constructive feedback to the devs is pointless its like being a testdriver and there is a wreck without tires in front of you

ok dont buy itdont simply dont 

i did and they can keep my money but do yourself a favour and wait at least another year

update 
did i expect major improvements with patch 1 no
do i try to be fair and just try it maybe motivated by a devresponse that the patch solves many issues  sure it would be rude to ignore it

an now for me its still a wreck still massive stagingfuel issues still disintegrating shipsand somewhat the performance seems worse  and yes even with a new save
do they just choose the crmpath to solve their issueswould be sad

#####

if you are planning to get this game wait for it to get the big roadmap updates because as much as i love this franchise i cant recommend this game considering the state that its in itll be a good game just not right now

#####

the game has redeemed itself with the for science update not only was most of the missing content from ksp1 filled in with the update but our confidence in private division has been restored as most of the launch issues are gone and we finally have science i can finally recommend this game to those who loved ksp1

#####

wait

#####

edit 05032023 upon more reflection i gotta give credit where its due while not making it worth the current price the tutorial is stellar i never got into ksp 1 but the tutorials in ksp 2 helped me understand the mechanics and concepts which i could then translate to ksp 1 im having a blast in ksp 1 now due to ksp 2 so its not completely a waste

i know this is early access but its really really broken probably some execs pushed for this games release i dont think any dev with any shred of respect for their craft would release a passion project like this in its current state execs need to get their heads out of their bum and let them finish in their pace this can only hurt ksp in the long run and subsequently the devs execs just fire the workers and get moved to another project to milk

#####

as of its current state  i would not recommend buying nor playing this game

the fact that this even was considered to being released ignoring that abuse of early access does not justify the price tag and chaotic state of which this game is currently at

can we please stop treating early access as a term for developers ramping up the price and not caring a bit about if the game is actually you know functional

this game promised a lot back in 2020  and even promised to be released years earlier  and yet were in 2023 with almost none of the features as well as missing the most basic of features from the first game

i honestly cannot tell at this point if this game was even in development back when they said they were planning to release of if they simply kept redrawing their entire game without actually developing ontop of what they had

this game is a joke of the first game as well as a mockery of early access titles  honestly if the game isnt ready and needs beta testing do not post it as an premium early access when were just paying to be a beta tester 

im extremely disappointed with the developers and with the fanbase who let this happen with not just this game but also with many other titles that abuse and misuse the term early access as beta channel

edit with the recent patch im more hopeful than before that ksp 2 might actually end up as a good game   i also dont ignore the fact that ksp 1 was very different when it first released but due to the lack of attention and the lack of comparison there was no fallout where as this time theres an entire game to compare this too as well as a large audience 

i support the developers in actually helping to create this game especially with their public outreach and support it brings me a lot of hope  what im annoyed about however is the publishers disconnect with the pricing and the understanding of what people are expecting from a 50 game

as a early access buyer i hope that us forking up 50 for a game thats worth 10 or less should be rewarded in the future with some sort of special expansion or something at least to justify even being an ea user

publishers need to actually respect and understand the developers because if the developers arent allowed to change the price to match the game public fallout will cost a lot more in the short and long term than any discounts would

#####

its playable now dont compare it to modded ksp1

id argue ksp2 is actually more fun than default ksp1 its like getting back to the original game 

its not finished there are glitches some of which hilarious others not so much

its easier to grasp than ksp1 much better for all new players and the majority of older players that are not space nerds

the sounds are amazing tbh the music is better the textures are better and the campaign is way better with a better progression tree

i reckon support the devs and get the game even if its on offer im confident this game will continue to improve which it has done significantly since release 



#####

im leaving a positive review but you probably shouldnt buy it just yet wait for more updates ksp 1 has more features than this atm

b apparently the publisher private division fucked over the devs and forced them to release ksp 2 in an unfinished state since they refused to provide additional funding if they didntb the game was borderline unplayable on launch but in the months since then the devs have improved performance a good amount its still not good but its playable id say gameplay is roughly equivalent to a lightly modded beta version of ksp 1 right now

for those unaware b the game promises significantly more features than the original game which ifwhen implemented will be incredible b

i fully believe that the devs will be able to pull a no mans sky and make this game great given enough time the only question for me is will private division let them

dont blame the developers for something which isnt their fault the gaming industry has serious issues and private division is an awful publisher yes as a fan of ksp im disappointed in the games current state however b publicly declaring this game a failure only pushes the publisher to pull funding which will kill not only this game but the franchise as a whole b

although ksp 2 is a sequel oftentimes this game feels worse than its predecessor i used to have hope in this game when it was released and for the first few weeks was able to look past the bugs then patch 1 released fixing 290 bugs including the trajectories bug which had made fuelefficient missions impossible a little less than a month later patch 2 released which fixed even more bugs and although i thought this patch was a little late it was still a step forward in the right direction then patch 3 rolled around not one but over 2 months after patch 2 this patch fixed a few bugs and added a few new parts one of which the airbrakes was bugged at the time of this review august 13th there have been a total of 2 hotfixes fixing a total of like 3 bugs and patch 4 is slated for near the end of this month another 2 months after patch 3 and devs have confirmed that this patch will include no new content and only bug fixes 6 months after launch this game is still in a sorry state and i dont think it will ever truly recover the games most prevalent bug wobbly rockets is still in the game and ruining missions and what to the devs have to say to this were rethinking how we think of wobbly rockets what is there to think about wobbly rockets on day 1 of the game people found a way to go into the games code and increase joint rigidity which fixed the wobbly rocket problem and 6 months later the devs still havent implemented a shortterm solution such as autostrut and dont get me started on the way the devs speak of their community not long ago when threads started private division posted a message stating that they cant wait for another platform where players can ask when the next patch is coming additionally the community managers thinks that bots are downvoting their comments on reddit guess what you arent getting downvoted because of bots youre getting downvoted because the game sucks colossal garbage not long ago the most recent reviews of ksp 2 are mostly negative and i am willing to bet that will transfer to all reviews as well i want this game to be as good as it wants to be but given the devs interaction with the community and the snails pace at which patches are released i dont think this game will truly ever be what it promised

#####

got this on sale

i knew it would be buggy af 

thought i could handle it after all i bought ksp1 in early access years before it came to steam i dealt with the kraken then i can deal with it now i thought the kraken being the name given to the personification of the ksp1 bugs

i convinced myself that hey its in early access it wont be finished im prepared for that i chose to believe the fanboys and crowd of people shouting about how its not an unfinished mess and that the bugs arent that bad

but no

this isnt a buggy game this cant even be called a game this is a tech demo a buggy tech demo

dont buy this pos dont do what i did and think aaah how bad could it be its bad

and anyone trying to defend this game by saying its early access and to expect an unfinished product  with all due respect  kindly shut up and understand that there is a massive difference between early access game and early access halfassed product that can barely be called a game 

an early access game has missing features but is still a playable albeit lacking experience that is what is meant by an unfinished product ksp1 was an unfinished product ksp2 has added features that flat out dont work and bugs that render the game unplayable this isnt simply an unfinished product its a barelyevenstarted product

its not even in a state worthy enough to be in early access thats how bad it is i honestly do not see how the devs have supposedly spent years on this 

every hour spent in the game has been me struggling against bugs and honestly being dumbstruck about how the game can be in this bad of a state

update 1  devs posted a fly to eeloo challenge today thought id do it i paid 30 for this pos might as well do something with it heres my experience

bug 1  symmetry is still borked in the vab had much fun trying to place struts

bug 2  game still cant figure out how much delta v you have if you have a fuel tank and engine feeding into another via a fuel line do i have enough delta v to get to eeloo who tf knows game sure doesnt

bug 3  wobbly rocket still happened despite overstrutting cant gravity turn effectively because having your rocket at an angle  limp dick rockets

bug 4  had to wait for a transfer window to eeloo  but despite going into the tracking station game still thinks im in control of rocket and thus limited to 3x time compression

bugfeature 5  doing the manoeuvre  and because the game doesnt tell you how much delta v you still have left to burn only how long the burn is in seconds it means you can never be totally accurate a 05 09 and 1 second burn are all listed as 1 second in ksp2 fun it means its real hard to time your burns accurately not important when youre just going to the mun but its real important when youre trying to hit a planet on the outer edge of the solar system

bug 6  since minor burns which youll always need to do given that burns are inaccurate add up to massive orbital changes over long distances and ksp2 doesnt tell you exactly how long you need to burn if your burn is under 1 second it meant i was flying blind when trying to alter my orbit by minuscule amounts had to do it by eye watching the orbit lines

bug 7  finally get an intercept i like select a point in the orbit just before encountering eeloo hit the warp to this position button wait as the game time warps to 10000 speed  and then fails to stop time warping watch as my craft sails past eeloo

bug 8  quick saveload didnt work autosave saved as my craft left eeloos gravity well


update 2  its been 7 months since this game released is it fixed any new features new mechanics anything

the symmetry bug seems to have been fixed other than that no not really

oh it runs slightly better now youd expect it to after 7 months of nothing but bug fixes  so now you can experience the nothingness the game offers in a semistable framerate so silver linings and all that

#####

game is now physically stable  no weird physics glitches occasional graphical glitches but solid fps on a laptop rtx2060  some annoying bugs with gameplay such as disappearing uncrewed ships still persist but id call the game fun enough to play and can now see a path to it being awesome just barely crossed the line to a thumbs up

edit october 26 2023 latest patch is a huge improvement still to play more but performance is great now and looks very pretty  not quite modded ksp 1 main concerns are ui and control and content related now not perfect but this is now very much playable and can be funthis the game should have launched 

ill potentially flip this thumb after i see what the science update is like

edit  april 17 2023

so ive played a couple more hours and the game is definitely more stable no crazy glitches so far made it to the munar orbit with no issues no ksc krakens exploding ships on decouple etc the maneuver nodes are now dare i say it  better than ksp1 performance is generally now what i would consider playable but poor more consistent across the board i noticed a few quite pretty graphical updates also

rockets still very wobblyplanes are broken it seems  wildly unstable sas causes flappy bird syndrome ksp1 carry over designs dont work well in ksp2 so far 

solid improvement with this patch  a lot of long days for ksp team i imagine 

still not recommended for the price a couple more solid patches and most crucially some part and vab additions just to get closer feature parity with ksp1 and it might be there

encouraging



edit  april 12 2023

latest patch seems to have finally yielded significant performance improvement need to play more in order to change the recommendation

original review

it really pains me to post this as ksp 1 is my favorite game ever but i cant recommend this after hours wrestling with the glitchy frustrating buggy vab the extra wobbling rockets then terrible performance and crashes post first patch i requested yet another refund this is different to ksp 1 early access that game was low on features but stable enough to be playable and fun and critically a bargain playing at this stage is an exercise in zen levels of patience and calmness my god for the price it feels like i have paid 50 bucks to be kicked in the teeth i have taken a breath and given it so many chances to shine sorry  but this doesnt deserve a positive review at this stage simple as that ill change it if the game changes what the hell was happening the last 3 years

#####

now that the science patch is in its worth playing

#####

look at how they massacred my boy

#####

not worth the price for early access asking 50 for this is pretty absurd

maybe eventually it will get good but in its current state its very broken and missing an insane amount of features present in the original

#####

i tried giving this game a fair chance i really did i remember being 12 years old and signing up for a steam account just to buy the original game way back in 2013 and how much i loved it i figured that now that the game was on sale and since some time had passed after the original launch that it would be worth it no no it absolutely isnt 

for starters the game runs terribly on my computer with an i99900ks3070ti32 gb ram everywhere except the main menu and vab even piloting a small spaceplane struggles to push past 40 fps and you can completely forget about anything with more than 10 parts a two stage rocket going through the atmosphere got me all of seven frames per second even when i got out of the atmosphere and was in deep space i still struggled to get more than 50 fps keep in mind the original game i would only get framerates that low when launching absolutely gigantic craft think like 50 parts another thing that really bothers me about this game is how clunky and unintuitive the ui is right clicking on any part in vab or flight lags the game for a solid few seconds to bring up a whole parts list instead of a simple context menu like in the first game also pressing ctrlz to undo a part completely deletes your entire craft apparently another thing too navigating around the vab like panning the camera is an absolute chore one thing i will say about the ui though in a positive manner is that i like the aesthetic they were going for but thats about it the third and most important complaint i have about this game is the lack of content yes i know its early access i know the game is still in development until t2 pulls the life support plug lol either way there is no way this game in this stage of development is worth the 40 theyre asking even during a sale 20 ok sure thats fair but the fact is theyre charging aaa pricing for a game an indie dev would refuse to release

im gonna refund this game which is a shame because i was really looking forward to this ever since the sequel first got announced in 2019 and maybe if they massively improve this game ill buy it again but i know better than to put this much faith in a company owned by taketwo

#####

since i was denied a refund and this turd has to sit in my library i will just say this is trash save your money and just mod the first one

#####

ksp2 is like jerking off for 3 years and when you finally finish just a puff of smoke comes out

10 months later and an actual update is released after trying it out i can say this i had a child born around the same time ksp2 released into early access if my childs development was as poor as ksp2s development i would have drowned her in a lake

bconclusionb
this beta is really only worth it if youre a big fan of kerbal space program and cant wait any longer ilike mei however it comes at a steep price for an early access title and will likely only increase by 1020 bucks when it leaves early access additionally its important to note that the game is currently very unoptimized and may not run well on most computers so unless you meet the minimum requirements and are not too attached to your hardearned money i wouldnt recommend buying it just yet however if you are a very impatient person like myself and you can afford it then why not just buy it and watch it grow

h1as a ksp1 player should i play this game nowh1
i have three major points bfirst of all my thumbsdown is not an indictment of ksp2b in a few years it may be a great game i have 550 hours in ksp1 which ive been playing since iitsi early access so i know how it goes when ksp2 says early access it means it

bsecondly this game is roughb i didnt experience outright crashes but ive seen a good number of bugs both large and small such as orbit lines in the map disappearing or an inability to control a vessel and various krakeny inexplicable midlaunch disassemblies and all these require odd workarounds or restarts of the software i often found myself bashing my head against jank than playing the game thats a bad place to be wasting most of a gaming session

the ui as well is rough it makes me appreciate all the subtle ways ksp1 is streamlined and pleasant to play in its current form and the multitude of ways it conveys useful information without mods while ksp2 provides enough information to wingit reminiscent of the early ksp1 days it does feel like a huge regression in several small ways its death by a thousand cuts

band thirdly ksp2 doesnt yet seem to be a significant improvementb sure theres new ui new graphics a rather good series of tutorials and so on but existing fans should want to see the sequel take the game to the next level in some dimension but for now its merely chasing parity with the predecessor the graphics while noticeably better arent imicrosoft flight simulatori levels of aweinspiring the physics jank aside feel roughly in line with ksp1 the rocketdesign experience in the vab is imorei and ilessi streamlined in countless ways the end result is a wash

the sciencemode campaign is more guided offering a series of specific goals which may help new players and encourage existing fans to take it slow its not as sequencebreaky as ksp1s science mode i think thats a reasonable change unfortunately there are a lot of odd design changes and omissions such as the way datasamples are handled or the lack of a science archive to review past investigations so even within its own scope the science mode feels unfinished 

ultimately i would recommend that fans of the original keep waiting on ksp2 maybe in a year itll cross that line where one can have ias muchi or imorei fun with the sequel but like icities skylines 2i ksp2 aint there yet

#####

unplayable as of 7292023 requesting refund and buying rimworld

#####

this is not a game its an empty shell of broken promises and mismanaged development maybe in 23 years it might be worth half of its current price but not while it has fewer features than ksp 1 did in beta the dream of a great ksp 2 is dead and nate simpson killed it

#####

save your time play ksp1 with mods through ckan disappointing game after so much hype

#####

15 fps on a 3080 during launch just isnt good enough for 50 for all the is early access bros  they should be charging early access prices

#####

this is what happens when an incompetent development studio meets a greedy publisher

this game was supposed to be released in 2020 as development began in 2017 we are getting a glorified tech demo in 2023 after multiple delayed release dates 

yes the game was likely pushed by the publisher and launched too early but who could blame them they cant just keep throwing money and time at a development studio that obviously cant produce the game the q1 2023 release date was announced during a taketwo earnings call over a year ago so dont act like the devs havent had a year to produce a stable release

this game is not even remotely worth the price they are charging without going any further 50 for an early access title is pushing it 50 for this early access build of ksp2 is inexcusable i cant believe anyone involved with this game is happy asking people to spend 50 of their hard earned money for this which they are because this early access title is being actively advertised

the tech demo itself is a worse performing version of ksp1 with the most basic of parts and no new features worth mentioning if youre a fan of ksp1 the game is horribly optimized the physics engine barely functions the kraken is worse than ever by this point i am sure youve heard already the state of the demo if youve read this far this could all be excused if the year was 2020 and they only charged 2530 but again they are charging hard working people 50 to beta test their tech demo 3 years after the planned release date to the actually the game is discounted right now due to early access sorry but the 10 discount means nothing when they havent provided even provided 10 of what was supposed to be released years ago i think early access is a great program and has produced some of my favorite games but this is hardly ready to be put out

no i am not going to pay essentially full price now in anticipation of further development from the devs that is not the purpose of the early access program rule 2 from steams early access overview states that

2 do not make specific promises about future events for example there is no way you can know exactly when the game will be finished that the game will be finished or that planned future additions will definitely happen do not ask your customers to bet on the future of your game customers should be buying your game based on its current state not on promises of a future that may or may not be realized
read the above rule again if you need to


the devs have stated themselves on steam

the 10 version of ksp 2 will include significantly more features than the early access version such as what you see on the roadmap plus other items added along the way this includes
 more parts and the opportunity for more creative builds
 more star systems and hidden anomalies
 improved quality of life and onboarding to open up the vast beauty of space to even more players
 continued performance improvements and visual updates
we cant wait for you to join us on this journey into the stars

based on the devs verbiage above how are they not asking me to bet on the future of the game they are asking me to pay 50 and hope they implement their planned roadmap when havent even proved they can make a functioning game they cant even release the most basic version of the game possible that isnt objectively terrible after years of development yall are saying that youd happily spend 50 for the game as is

anyone who worked on this game does not deserve a dime from the consumer if that means ksp2 is cancelled then it is for the best this release is a shameless cash grab by a publisher who needs to recoup costs from an incompetent development studio that has wasted years of production i never thought these predatory business practices could happen to a franchise that has so much passion from fans and the great people who worked on ksp1

#####

newest patch made it almost playable  not quite there yet though

#####

many other reviewers have already laid bare their complaints so i wont go at length with mine im nothing more than a casual player with no great deep understanding of aeronautics or rocketry here are the basics

pros
  absolutely amazing sound design compared to ksp
  good improvement on visuals
  great ui
  the trip planner and maneuver planner although buggy and not super effective show great promise 
  i find the vab easier to navigate and use than it was in ksp
  the new tutorials are engaging and wellmade

cons
  physics engine needs some more work youll be fighting it to keep your vehicles in controllable flight this is the biggest complaint since its what makes this game hard to really play at length right now
  new fairings there is some real promise in these but they are extremely fussy right now im certain these are in no way near complete from a development perspective as are most of the cons youll see
  trajectory curve in the map has a habit of disappearing which means you cant use maneuver points your missions can still be salvaged thanks to the inclusion of the appe altitudes listed below the gimbal but its not optimal

as of this writing i have one probe in orbit over kerbin and ive had a successfulish mun excursion still need to work on getting the remaining kerbins back home physics engine caused the destruction of the lander while attempting to  leave the mun

overall i didnt and seeing the direction theyre going with ksp 2 still dont mind giving them my money for this game its very obvious this still a very early alpha it takes money to make these games and although the 50 price tag seems steep im willing to stake it as a bet on the product this will be developed into there arent any real objectives since right now all they have implemented is a sandbox mode so its going to take some updates fixes and content additions to make this into something you keep coming back to i have faith itll happen though

should you get it  that depends if you are on a budget and want the greatest short term return on investment on your purchases i would hold off if you have the cash to support these developers salaries so we can continue to enjoy improvements on one of the best aeronautical games weve ever had then i would recommend purchasing this however if you do just temper your expectations personally im treating this more as a preorder with a playable demo

#####

my specs
gpu gtx 1070
cpu i77700k
ram 16 gb

to continue talking about the performance as thats what most are looking here is a breakdown of my fps in different areas i am running the game on high settings 1080p low did not increase the fps noticeably
title screen 200 fps
vab 80100 fps
load screens 60 fps
launchpad 40 fps
launching 2030 fps
cloud level 1520 fps
upper atmosphere 2030 fps
high orbit 3045 fps

overall better than i expected given my gpu and what people have been saying that being said these are still very low performance for what is nearly an 80 cad game after tax ive been playing ksp since early access of the first game so i do have trust in the process but right now optimization is pretty bad if you enjoyed the first game and have the extra money to support the development process of this game i say go for it but do not go in expecting a finished product if thats what youre after i would just stick with ksp 1 until some big updates come for this one

edit added resolution

#####

kerbal space program 2 fps

#####

i would recommend the game
however the private division launcher is garbage just trash worthless and is purely unnecessary i paid for the game through steam i should be able to launch it through steam using steam to launch the private division launcher takes about 520 minutes for the game to finally launch i am an adult with limited time to game this us purely bloatware i understand piracy is a thing but jacking over your paying customers to prevent the pirates punishing the good to catch a few bad actors is the lamest shortsighted narrowest thinking action a company can take

#####

with the latest update for science this game is more playable i have not encountered any issues and it is nice to have some progression in the game there are some fun things to find as well i would still not really recommend the game in the current state over eg ksp1 if youd like to support the developers consider buying this at a discount otherwise i would honestly still wait until there is more content in the game

old review

you can build half a rocket that will wobble to orbit if you manage to leave orbit you will probably be unable to land anywhere because of other bugs or your rocket will just randomly explode trajectory lines are bugged heat shielding is not needed as there is no heat in the game no patch with anything new for 5 months despite everything being near completion not worth the money at the moment if i could refund i would wish the devs the best

#####

i say this with a really heavy heartb but b
h1b ksp2 is not ready for early access not by a long shotb  h1
edit and likely never will be

you are bnotb buying a game thats at the level of ksp1 with the promise of more
you are bnot evenb buying a game thats at the level of the ksp1 beta with the promise of more 
what you bareb buying is a strikegamestrike striketech demostrike scam that is generously at the level of the ksp1 alpha 016 of around 2012

but that doesnt even matter because
h2you are not likely to even get to the point where the missing ksp1 features are going to bother you h2
not to put to fine a point on it but a fitting description for the current level of technical inadequacies on this project causes epistemological problems of sufficient magnitude as to lay a heavier burden upon the logical and semantic resources of the english language than they can reasonably be expected to bear

list
    performance is bbeyondb abysmal even on a reasonably highend system that runs ksp 1 with 200 mods incl scattererparallax8k textures etc i barely get 25 fps
    the floor is bliterallyb made of kraken valentina fell through the ground on her first eva
    building a vessel with one pod one fuel tank and any more than 4 engines is an binstantb ticket to 10 fps or less
    physics are very wonky orbital parameters jump around wildly upon changing soi
    ui is incredibly buggy and often unresponsive the part manager in particular is a tragedy 
    maneuver nodes  delta v calculation are so broken that they might as well not be there at all 
    the game crashed twice in my 50 minutes with it 
    dont even ask me how bill kerman died 
list

h2the game lacks a shocking amount of basic features  subsystems right now h2
list
    no iva view which btw was present even during the early days of ksp1s alpha
    no heat system edit allegedly hidden away in the options somewhere
    no world interactions
    no kerbal skill levelling
    
list

on a more fundamental and ui want to stress thisu bsubjectiveb level
h2some of the design decisions seem questionableh2
list
    the pixelated artstyle of the ui is needlessly distracting and feels very out of place 
    i have a feeling that in order to make the game easier to learn a lot of concepts  controls like for example vab symmetry or vab vs sph layout have been simplified into just one unified solution this in my view does not appreciably simplify anything but rather makes for something that is way worse than the analogous ksp1 solutions
  while wings are now procedural yay this massively needed and welcome simplification for some reason ends right there
why why for example have tons and tons of different fuel tanks just so you can say there are many more parts now the procedural fuel tanks mod for ksp 1 showed us exactly how its done why not embrace such easy and obvious qol improvement when the wings themselves are already procedural fuel tanks 
again subjective but i am not a fan of the overly plastic glossy look that everything has now
list

h1the perplexing question really becomes this 
why even launch a game that is bthisb broken h1
even with all the good will i can muster how can anyone with a sound state of mind and a reasonable grasp on reality expect a warm reception given the glaringly obvious in many ways gamebreaking issues 

i really do edit have no hope that the devs can get this game to where it needs to be
however given what i have seen and given that the only sensible explanations i can come up with for launching in this state are not exactly reasons for optimism i got myself a refund

hrhr
h1b end of reviewb 
answering recurring comments beyond this pointh1
hrhr
h1regarding the early access commentsh1
quoteastreon bro its a early access quote
bso thats not a get ouf of jail free cardb
again i am not saying it wont get good in fact i breallyb want it to 
even with early access titles you should never buy just that promise there needs to be at least something fun there already 
this game needs at least another year of development before we even get into the territory of a playable beta likely multiple years on top of that to fulfil its promise you have no guarantees the plug wont be pulled long before that

h3 but there is a more unsettling reality to this h3
this is bnotb a small indie developer without any line of credit we are talking about here
its btake 2 interactiveb a massive corporate behemoth with a present market cap of more than 17 billion  to them ksp2 most certainly is bnotb a passion project bits nothing more than a business decisionb
their responsibility lies with their shareholders and not us the fanbase 
consequently if its in the interest of the shareholders to cancel this project say because after more than three years of development theres little to write home about then the management at take 2 interactive has little choice but to cancel it otherwise it opens itself up to lawsuits by investors 

so no people who are unwilling to buy into that future promise for 50 are not entitled millennials as some would have you think nor do they lack the mental faculties for understanding what early access means they are quite simply rational actors who come to a regrettable conclusion based upon the information presently available to them

hrhr
h2regarding the pricing commentsh2
i honestly believe 50 for a working beta of what was promised would actually have been an appropriate prize
space sims are a niche genre and the cost of living has gone up everywhere developers need to be remunerated for their hard work 
but alas this is bnotb a working beta of what was promised

hrhr
h2regarding the physicsh2
quotevalid adding on that theyve had three years already and at the least their physics arent even done yet quote

i wanted to omit this but looking at the comments i feel it pertinent to add this back in 
the physics system is definitely different and in a way that actually gives me a lot of hope because cpu utilization in my short testing was really surprisingly low
but kraken aside i think it lives underneath launchpad 2 btw its currently incredibly bouncy and there is zero structural rigidity to the crafts you build 
here to one feels reminded of the early ksp alpha where you were forced to put struts on every single part 

hrhr
h2you misremember early ksp 1h2
no i do not obviously some hyperbole was used in the writing of this iadmittedlyi harsh review 

bbutbif we endeavour to be objective we must hold a 30 person studio that is 3 years behind schedule  owned by a multi billion dollar publisher to a slightly different standard than what was initially little more than a oneman show working out of a mexicocity based advertising agency 

ksp alpha 017 had iva in 2012 this does not in 2023
that is why i chose that as the reference point for my comparison
i obviouslyi  ksp 2 has some features right now that werent present back then 

hrhr
h2you only played 95 hours of ksp1 h2
i used a custom exe because of x64 and mods for the longest time kids these days have no idea how life was before ckan
in reality i have several thousand hours in ksp1 and started playing in 2011 
hrhr
h2you only played x minutes of ksp2h2
yes
hrhr
i have now refunded this game and will hopefully buy back in once the situation improves 
again i really do hope that this will be the case because ksp is one of my great gaming loves and for all my criticism there is a lot to be praised here as well

#####

pricetags ets expectations
ithe internet historiani

after a lot of tought on this review of all the shortcomings of fellow reviewers its just boil down to that this is not worth the pricetag



#####

tldr aaa pricing for a game thats barely a disgusting tech demo do not buy 

i loved ksp1 played it religiously when it started to get popular watched all of scott manleys videos along with other well know youtubers who took off because of ksp its a great game infinite replayability especially with mods and i was very much looking forward to the release of ksp2 my excitement was on par with god of war ragnarok fortunately at least that game delivered

this game was nothing but a terrible tech demo at launch buggy and unstable and the game is still very much those things just slightly less so thanks to the pedestrian update cadence 

so many features are missing from ksp1 too no science no thermals no momentary sas button the recipe is already there all you have to do is improve on it not reinvent the wheel 

speaking of that momentary sas function not being present the devs sure do talk a lot about how much they cant stop playing the game meanwhile there seems to be a lot of qol issues in the game like the one already mentioned and twr being hidden inside of some toolbar menus instead of easily accessible to use when building a rocket embarrassingly enough there are already mods that help fix a lot of these types of issues including giving twr for each stage rather than just the whole rocket 

and now the devs want to slow down the update cadence even further two small stability updates in two months since release the game is a whole lot of nothing and you want to slow down the updates further 

i could write you a whole book about how this game is a monumental failure of a launch sure its early access so what shouldve i expected well for fifty dollars i expect a lot more than an unstable version of ksp1 from 2013 you cant call yourself early access and then charge almost full aaa pricing at the same time the game as it is right now is worth 10 maybe 15 that is the price i expect this kind of disappointment not 50

i fully expect this game to be abandoned in the next 612 months there is no faith in the developers no transparency dont waste your time

#####

use alt f8 for cheats also exploration is more fun than sandbox

#####

as of the science update it seems this game has finally got on track this was the feature i was waiting for and it seems like a steady foundation for progression in game performance has improved since the original launch for me  rtx 3090 i5 13600k
fingers crossed for more updates as substantial as this that are less than 9 months apart 

not out of the woods yet but heading in the right direction

#####

barely playable feel like they should be paying me to play it at this point in development

its just not ready yet even for the limited feature set promised half of what is in the game is buggy or just completely broken

come back in a year and maybe itll be worth a shot but in this state it isnt and 50 is a slap in the face

#####

that is absolutely depressing the first game had an excuse for coming out in a similar state it was one man over 8 months this thing is a product of a large team over at the very least 3 years this is unacceptable

#####

im not a game dev but i feel like you should probably finish something before you sell it for full price

#####

how has the modern gaming industry come to this i have spend hundreds of hours in the first game and was counting the days until this game released i bought it as soon it was unlocked and was exited to play i am absolutely appalled by the state of this game i understand its in beta i understand it will be fixed later but how has our modern gaming industry got to the point where game developers are no longer paying for beta testers instead relying on dedicated fans to spend 50 on a broken game to beta test for them i want to like this game i really do i think it has a lot of potential to add a large amount of content over the original game but the problem is none of it works i truthfully hate that the modern gaming industry has decided that selling a completely broken game and fixing it later has become the accepted norm now again i recognize this is a beta release and bugs are expected but when basic things such as capsule recovery does not work and your kerbals disappear into the ether thats just unacceptable despite years of delays this game is not even close to being anything close to being done and while yes most of these problems will probably be fixed in future updates to the game the main problem of a product being rushed to market in a clearly unfinished state can never be undone companies should not make their most dedicated fans pay for the honor of debugging their new games

#####

science is coming in december yay
also the windows system registry bug has been fixed

#####

charging full price for an ea demo is a slap in the face to their customer base

for 50 you get a buggy demo and a bunch of someday promises  why on earth should we expect a multitude of new features when it took this team 3 12 years to get to this point

go buy the original and play that it is cheaper and infinitely better

#####

this is a tech demo in its current state come back when multiplayer and workshop support arrives

i wont be refunding this game as the vision that the ksp devs have promised is something i can get behind regardless i would not recommend that anyone buys this game until there is an actual finished polished product to play

#####

the for science update has totally changed this game and my opinion of it before the update i had a combined 50ish hours of playtime spread pretty evenly since ea launch day in february 2023 and the game literally just the bareminimum sandbox before now was a hot mess performance was terrible even the most powerful gaming pcs out there couldnt maintain 60fps bugs everywhere basic things like reentry heating or thermals in general were missing etc

the science update added what is basically a campaign with missions and a tech tree to gradually unlock all the parts it also brought pretty massive performance jumps heatingthermals though they definitely need some tweaking and are still in a pretty rough inconsistent state and a slew of bugfixes including a shortterm bandaid solution for the wobbly rockets issue this alone makes flying rockets way more fun

i have now completed the campaign missions and the only side mission i have yet to do is the surprisingly ambitious eve return trip with 10 kerbals onboard eve is easily the most difficult place to land and return from as it has a very thick atmosphere and almost twice the surface gravity of kerbin its often considered the final boss of ksp1 im waiting on that one until heating has been improved a bit

is this game worth 50 to me absolutely to people new to this type of game i would wait the tutorials are great and walk you pretty smoothly through what is a pretty steep orbital mechanics learning curve the campaign missions imo are probably aimed at players like me as opposed to learning players as i think the difficulty curve makes a slightly toosteep jump after the 4th or 5th mission asking you to do interplanetary landings at very specific spots

there are definitely still big issues with the game but ive put over 130 hours into the new update and have only reached the ragequit frustration point once prescience update i was never able to make it longer than an hour or 90 minutes for the first time since the gameplay footage started coming out in the weeks leading up to the ea release and the state of the game became clear ive been genuinely excited to play this game

im so so glad this is turning around and slowly winning the community over and i now cant wait for colonies interstellar and multiplayer

#####

dont buy this game its angering how greedy the developers are at releasing this with a price tag like that the game is unplayable due to major performance issues there is only sandbox mode with even less features as ksp1 on release it should be illegal to release something for this much money in the state its in currently

#####

i have tried to like this game but it pales compared to even stock ksp1 i suggest getting ksp 1 and adding mods until ksp2 matures if it ever does i would get a refund if i was able to

#####

honestly just use ksp1  ksp2 is really mostly just ksp1 with all of the bugs but a lot of features removed

#####

just as a warning this review is quite messy but i need to put my emotions on full display just so everyone knows how disappointed us ksp fans are

okay at this point i think its time to officially say

there is no way in hell development on this game is going according to plan

lets go wayyy back to aug 2019 when the game was revealed to us all the features they promised were great i personally was looking forward to interstellar travel the most since exploration is my favorite part of ksp 1 and i was getting very tired of visiting the same few bodies over and over again and it seemed like i wouldnt even need to wait that long the game was planned to come out in 2020 the trailer said just 2020 but according to this polygon article  httpswwwpolygoncom201981920812560kerbalspaceprogram2announcementreleasecolonizemun   it was actually first slated for march of that year just a few months from then

and then the game was delayed with a time frame of anywhere from apr 2020 to mar 2021 thats fine a delayed game is eventually good but a rushed game is forever bad you know not to mention such a game would need to be quite complex i was sure it would turn out great at launch

then it got delayed a second time to fall 2021 um thats still fine i mean take all the time you need but maybe you should have set a better job at handling fan expectations in the beginning though the pandemic deffo complicated things a whole lot but games at least still launched back then even if at a slower rate

and then the original studio was poached by take two and was shut down yeah now theres definitely some kind of trouble but at least squad would be coming in to help even if that meant ksp 1 wouldnt be getting any more updates but would that mean the game would be delayed a 3rd time yes it was to 2022

okay its gonna be coming two years late now quite a large leap from what was initially expected to be just a 8 monthish hype cycle at the very least but this has to be the year no

delayed to 2023 um what the heck this cant be normal anymore i mean it already wasnt when star theory was shuttered they said it was due to complexity but at this point shouldnt you have already known how complex it would be whatever the delay cant be that massive at this point its been worked on for so long and if they had some launch year announced for such a long time it cant be that far off right i was sure id finally be able to enjoy interstellar travel by say mid 2023 i never thought id have to wait all that time again only for another delay to finally play the whole game surely not right 

right

and then came the early access announcement um what thats very surprising even with ksp 1 also being in early access kinda strange it would be needed for a game that was supposedly so close to being finished its gonna be finished in a timely manner right i mean they were still able to show off something for the late road map stuff it cant possibly be as long as ksp 1s ea period right

well to cut to 7 months after the games very poor ea launch which i will let the other kind reviewers describe since id mention everything they already did we still dont have science yet thats step one almost oct 2023 and we still dont have science hell reentry heating is still not in the game yet correct me if im wrong but at release you said thered only be a very short window of when it was absent does 7 months seem very short to you  ksp 2 doesnt even have an improved user experience which id consider having a much greater amount ksp 1s features than what we got plus the qol stuff you know the first item of whats basically what was mentioned would be at launch so in a way ksp 2 isnt even at step zero yet theres no way in hell this should be acceptable this isnt what i was expecting when the game launched at a 50 price tag in any access

now to be clear im not mad i have to wait so long for this game to come out at all like i said delays can be good i know that sounds kinda contradictory given the disappointment i had in the delays but thats less the wait part and more the expectations of hype i should have being told this game wont be ready for many many years once is better than being told this game will be ready next year 4 whole times because each time regardless of how long it is im always gonna expect the same a high quality product being told of a game delay is never gonna change how i expect it will come out even if it will indeed be a good thing in the long term since my expectations are already at the tippitiy top but it becomes truly despicable when it gets delayed so many times and yet what we get is still not polished like howd id expect

thats why this game is such a massive disappointment this game was my second most anticipated game of all time only behind tears of the kingdom now it sits at the very top of my most disappointing list its very clear now the game was horribly managed by the take two executives not the devs the ones in the trenches since if it was any better managed

1 it would not see its first studio shut down in the way it did
2 would have been announced far later when they were sure it was truly ready and
3 it would not have launched it such a piss poor state

please do better ive seen many games launch in such a state not in ea but thats hardly an excuse when your game costs 50 and while some recover others dont i really hope its the former case but at this point i cant rule out the latter being what ultimately ends up happening here

#####

been playing ksp since the alpha days i have way more hours logged in ksp 1 but not on steam  all we really ever wanted was the upgrade to the new engine and better performance i dont know what this mess is and why they did take this long for that mess the og squad is probably laughing their aes off right now 

dont even try to use early access as excuse all the features are gone its a buggy mess and we been teased for years for a worthy successor of ksp just delete the whole project and port ksp to the new engine and fix the memory leaks

this was the only game i really was looking forward to but it says all when even scott manley tells his viewers in a nice way to stay away from the game in it current state hugly disappointed maybe the og squad can make a new ip with different name  a man can dream right

#####

this is not what early access should be ea games should be playable but incomplete yes there will be missing features and yes there will be bugs but the core gameplay should all be there and there should be few if any gamebreaking bugs this game doesnt even have a working physics engine no career or even science mode and is full of gamebreaking bugs thats not even to mention the aaa pricetag for an incomplete mess ea games are essentially using players as testers and are usually priced accordingly this game is priced like a aaa game despite its preea state 

it should not have been released until the physics was working and should have had at least the features from the ksp1 base game with the dlc features multiplayer colonies other systems etc to come later but the core should have been there this feels like the devs were running out of money and needed an injection of cash i doubt it will ever be finished just go play the original

#####

i just refunded this last night and the refund came through within 2 hours let it not be said that gabens justice has vanished from the earth

i really didnt want to refund it i bought it knowing full well that the performance was probably going to be really bad and that id have to play it on low and save constantly i was hooked as soon as i opened the game  it captured the kerbal atmosphere perfectly it was beautiful

i began to build a rocket in the new vehicle assembly building and unfortunately i went back to tha old me and making a big interplanetary cruiser with a nuclear engine they added a bigger nuclear engine i was so excited i had to use it it was solidly built  ive made dozens of these suckers in ksp 1  with plenty of struts to keep it from exploding on launch i launch the rocket and as soon as the launchpad screen is open i get the launch failed window as all the parts of my beautiful rocket explode in every direction at 2 frames per second turns out you cant make big rockets in ksp 2 yet apparently its in the patch notes or something

thats fine ill be a little less ambitious i go back to the vehicle assembly building to design a little rocket maybe a probe or something maybe a super low budget minmus mission with only the vehicle command seat instead of a pod but theres no apparent way to make a new rocket without overwriting the old one

thats when it hit me with perfect clarity like a diamond bullet to the forehead this game should not have been released to the public this is a nearly unplayable prealpha that they charged 70 dollars for i need to refund it immediately before i get too much playtime and wont be covered by steams refund policy

looking back i would be glad to pay more than 70 dollars for a ksp 2 that actually worked but this just isnt it it doesnt work its early access so everyone expects jank and missing features but its so broken its not even enjoyable

i look forward to buying ksp 2 once theyve done some basic bugfixes and optimization to make it playable and i really hope they actually end up doing that rather than just abandoning the game or something if this botched launch ends up killing ksp 2 it will be to the eternal shame of the marketing parasites that pushed it out the door before it was ready

#####

price tags set expectations compare this game to no mans sky indie studio releases aaa priced title disappointing literally everyone at launch after lengthy delays community feels betrayed flagship features are missing 

no mans sky was released aug 9 2016 first major patch foundations was released nov 16 2016 and actually brought new features for the game double that time has passed since ksp 2s launch and no new features hell the second major update for nms was released 7 months after launch and also brought new features go watch the internet historians video

i bought the game on launch and believed it would improve over time 6 months later the first item promised has yet to be released heating isnt even listed in the roadmap this is like roadmap step 0 i have over 1000 hours in ksp1 on steam easily another 1000 on several different heavily modded ckan installs im so disappointed that the sequel doesnt do anything better than the original right now except for clouds

maybe in a year or so things will be better i hope so

edit formatting

#####

i cant believe its already been a year since this todo list masquerading as a game came out its kerbal space program except its missing everything that kerbal space program has and it had no mods and it costs more i think we all assumed when it was delayed by nearly 3 years they were working hard to get it on par with vanilla ksp but none of that implied effort is on display here

to the people leaving a thumbs up because they like the company its a completely different development team the people who made ksp great havent been involved for about half a decade at this point and this feels like a cash grab off the back of the hard work the ogs did all those years ago

#####

let me preface this by saying that i am a person who is generally very forgiving about nongamebreaking bugs in games

that being said there are an unreasonable number of gamebreaking bugs in this game as well as general things that i found to be worse than ksp1 so ill just list the things ive personally experienced in less than 3 hours of playtime
 horrendous pixelation atabove cloud layer
 figher planes fly like a380s in mollases
 panther engine produces unusably anemic thrust and afterburner mode produces no thrust at all
 colcom markers in the vab straight up lie
 wings fall off when you quick load and the camera floats off for no reason they dont even explode they just cease to be attached and float away at  02ms
 spontaneous loss of crewed vehicle control
 every craft desires the cold embrace of the dirt and ocean at least 3 more than ksp1
 there are no personal parachutes
 there is no autostrut

this game should not be in early access its a beta release thats being sold for 50 on a good day

#####

updated for patch 21 on 31012024 still a hard pass but not that hard of a pass as it at least resembles a gameplay loop now even tho it is on rails for the most part
updated for patch 013 still a hard pass

the current state of the game
 much less content than game#1 nothing changed up to 013 and we may not get anything for another half a year at least  science added in 20
 no campaign mode
 no science mode included as of 20
 bug ridden patch 013 improved this somewhat 20 and 21 also did help but the major problems are still there like decaying orbits
 new knowledge with 013 game updates are getting slower and slower content is supposed to be in the works but expected with 02 at the earliest which is 69 months away at the current pace
 new knowledge with 013 people that supported the game by not refunding straight away are now getting shafted by discounts this is somewhat normal but a game in this terrible state should not hit on those few people that still support it

on the plus side
 developers seem extremely enthusiastic and determined
 it is still kerbals we are talking here 

for some this may not be a hard pass since enthusiastic developers usually deliver at some point but if money is tight just wait a while dont buy now unless you want to support development there is no game to enjoy as of now just a few features that all dont work well or at all a skeleton of a game or a proof of concept  tech demo if you prefer those terms


#####

5 days to the game being released for a whole year

still cant bind the e key to anything

give it 3 more years

#####

well they did make a lot of improvements in the science release but i think the significantly better reviews mostly come from just folks having reduced their expectations down to rock bottom and this cleared that hurdle

i just played about 8 hours of the game starting a new science campaign and the campaign missions are bland but reasonably well thought out it gives the game some structure

but jeez none of that can keep your attention away from the just miserable amount of bugs and problems the game still has i dont know how they keep releasing this game with just unsolveable issues everywhere you go

my favorite bug is the time advance slider its just so random because it has some sort of built in delay switching between options but you can click it a lot faster than that delay you are just constantly in 4x speed but actually paused or at 1x speed but you cant use your engines because it thinks you are 2x speed still its not a game breaking problem but for old kerbal veterans its just maddening because you do it all the time 

can you setup manuever nodes while paused nope gotta do it at 1x speed but if you are in 1x speed and the game thinks you are in 2x speed you cant interact with the node wtf its just stupid

want to set a target of minimus to do your alignment burn but you have a sattelite in low earth orbit around minimus good luck you cant click on minimus without clicking on the satellite oh i will just zoom in then nope now the satellite is like a giant pixellated icon blocking minimus entirely

i try not to judge it down just because they chose to do something differently than ksp1 but damn try to check how much fuel you have in a random tank in your setup you can do it but its 3 clicks and then if you try and transfer its bugged and it keeps replicating your tank why on earth cant you just right click on a tank to see how much fuel is in there

they added a bunch of fancy tick marks to the map view when trying to intercept a planet but they took away the one thing i need the periapsis for the planet approach its so much easier to intercept when you can minimize that periapsis value it just makes me feel like these people have never played the original game the ticks are nicer than the original ksp1 single tick mark i guess but thats just to get you in the ballpark you need that periapsis to actually intercept well

they fixed the janky rockets problem of the original mostly by just making most of the joints rigid thats really how ksp1 ended up fixing it long ago it was a little more complicated than that but fundamentally thats how it went 

the one positive thing i will say it does look like they are really trying to make it better i had assumed when it came out that it was just a money grab this release shows promise maybe with another year or two we will actually get there 





#####

ksp2 is not worth purchasing

75 canadian50 usd is unacceptable for a buggy featureless unfinished early access game where we are paying full price to alpha test a game that we will to play a version 10 in 5 years

early access games are meant for game makers to release a rough version of the game lacking some features while the players test out the game throughout the development towards version 10 in exchange developers recognise this the game is typicaly discounted to a price that represents the early access exchange between players and game makers

early access exchange 

we sell you a discounted unfinished rough version of our game you pay a discounted rate and test it for us while we finish the game adding content along the way

charging full aaa game prices for the state current state of this game is a giant fu to the ksp community

that is if the so called indie developers finish their game while firing key developmental staff weeks after release

i hope for the best if the game is truly finished one day i will maybe check it out then but its not worth aaa full price that they are asking for a d quality of game

reasons for refund

a ridiculous level of bugs

large chunks of a ksp game missing from the game

calling a game indie made by a mediumlarge developer is insulting to some of the actually indie developers out there

charging 75 for a unfinished game that wont be finished in less that 2 to 3 years minimum 

firing a key developer among other issues regarding development

none of this is the fault of the developers this entire situation reeks of corporate greed trying to cash in before the reality of a highly anticipated game thats doing poorly at release at 48 out of 10 it deserves a 48 out of 10 right now

if the game was decently discounted or more content included thats buggy then it would be more tolerable

but they are asking us to pay full price  test their game  wait years for content  deal with the nonenjoyable bugs  watch corporate game developers call themselves indie  watch them fire key developers 




#####

expect this one to be in early access for a long long time and buy accordingly 

there is nothing in the game as of the early access launch a tutorial and free building rockets 
there are currently no reentry physics or atmospheric pressure so while you have access to a bunch of rocket parts you have nothing to really test them against 

im a super fan with 300 hours in thee first ksp so this was an instant purchase for me but most people are definitely gonna want to hold off until it gets some more features

i launched a kid into space and he aint neva gon see his family again

bthis review may be out of date as of december 19 2023 i have not yet had an opportunity to play the for science update this review will be updated when i canb

i would like nothing more than for this to have been a glowingly positive review when the time comes that ksp2 is a decent game ill be very happy to post a review where i gush over all the awesome little things this game has to offer currently though i cant truthfully ive been putting off making this review because i absolutely love ksp seeing its sequel in this state is almost soulcrushing

bthe badb
perhaps my expectations are too high but ksp2 currently is lacking most features from the original game as well as the vast majority of promised features that were supposed to be included in this game even for early access there is painfully little content it is currently a pure sandbox with absolutely nothing to strive for outside the initial challenge of landing on the various planets and moons

bugs are another point id like to touch on it seems that no matter what i attempt to do how carefully i plan ahead or how much effort i put into avoiding known issues that every single mission ends with my craft destroying itself falling through the ground the camera not being able to decide which half of a vessel to follow after staging soi changes causing unexpected changes to the path of my vessel you get it the game is a hot mess right now and is barely playable outside of excruciatingly simple missions it seems that the rumors of the krakens death were greatly exaggerated and it is hungry kerbonaughts beware

performance is just plain bad i run the game on a ryzen 5 5600x and rtx 2080 super and can barely manage to break the 30fps barrier i dont exactly have topoftheline hardware but i think its reasonably fair to say that 30fps is on the low side of what i should be expecting either the game has way more going on than i think there is or it is horribly optimised

bthe goodb
visuals the game certainly looks better than stock ksp1 admittedly theyd have to fail really really hard to not improve over ksp1s graphics i love that game but without mods it is certainly not a looker

procedural wings i love them probably my favourite part of the game in its current state if you can think of a wing shape you can probably make it this is a gargantuan improvement over ksp1s wing pieces itd be awesome if the roster of procedural parts were to be expanded  procedural tanks anyone

paints honestly kind of a minor thing but i like being able to paint my rockets good inclusion 1010 will paint again

bthe nitpicksb
some relatively minor things that i really really dislike about ksp2

the parts manager i absolutely loathe this abomination its slow its clunky its poorly designed  and most of the time its vital i could see a use for it if it was redesigned but for now please give back the ksp1style interaction menu i beg you please

the ui on a technical level the ui is an improvement over ksp 1 important information is more condensed around where youll be looking most of the time and thats good however the arrangement and scaling of certain aspects is cause enough for me to dislike it the navball and associated information are crammed together in a corner the time warp controls are for some reason in  the most important spot  that being the bottom centre and the kerbal portraits take up way too much space regarding that silly go button  who is that thing for who out there is using a ui element to launch and stage

bendy rockets intercept buddies pals of all the things you could have brought over from ksp1 did you ireallyi have to include the single worst feature not only did you bring it back but its worse now any vessel that is of moderate size or higher needs to be strutted to high heck so that it doesnt bend in half during ascent i could excuse this if they had at least included autostrut but they didnt im not asking for rockets to be entirely inflexible  i just want it to make sense for example parts that are the same diameter those should be pretty rigid parts mounted radially on little strut spindles thats when you should need struts

bthe conclusionb
so ksp 2 it was rushed and put into early access well before it was ready and now the entire franchise has been tarnished i dont doubt that at some point ksp2 will be great  but today is not that day please save yourself from the frustration and skip out on getting this game for now for the time being ksp 2 is little more than a tech demo with a shiny early access sticker to shield it from criticism

breview updatesb
september 21 2023
it has now been half a year since ksp 2 released into early access and i thought id make a little update to my review as of today there has been woefully little progress made by the development team bug fixes have been few and far between no roadmap features have been added ive seen player counts as low as 80 here on steam the developers are showing only minimal signs of life and ive officially ran out of hope for this game maybe itll turn out well but i doubt it

#####

i dont see a reason for this sequel of ksp to cost 50 on launch its pretty much got the same content as ksp1 just more buggy etc no interstellar stuff added into the game yet the first one is just 10 and gives you pretty much the same content with much more fidelity this game was announced in 2019 sure the game had to be rewritten from the ground but but allat time and its at most just buggier ksp1 

i think the price should be reduced until its got a bit more to show compared to the first one recommend no check back in 12 years or again if youre new just buy the og

#####

10 fps  3070 and i7 and 32gb ram

rubbery ships that are nearly uncontrollable during launch

ship destruction upon loading scene

phantom forces applied to ships in space that cause them to constantly tumble roll and change direction while constantly getting faster  good luck docking

symmetry in the vab does not work

time warp breaks orbits and launch you into the next universe

will be refunding and reinstalling ksp1 and come back later  this is not ea i played ksp1 when that was pre alpha this isnt even a tech demo

i hope you guys get this situated intercept would love to see you and this succeed



#####

i bought this when it first came out and at that point the game was a very buggy mess now however it seems like theyve seriously cracked down on those bugs theyve been improving this game so much after the initial release and the newest research update started adding a muchneeded campaignlike mode i cant wait to see what the devs have in store in the coming years of the games development

#####

just play ksp1 until this is actually a finished game

#####

we dont have all the features of ksp on day one but ksp2 is a fundamental improvement in many ways the one core thing thats a problem right now is performance any time kerbin is in view the game just gets super laggy 

on a positive note load times are drastically reduced the ui got a huge boost all the way around procedural aircraft wings live swap to the tracking station and huge improvements to craft switching just to name a few but the overall performance is what kills it at the moment even if your specs far exceed whats recommended

if youre expecting all ksp features on day one here youll be disappointed if youre expecting decent frame rates on a decent pc youll be disappointed but what you are getting is a fundamentally improved experience in many key ways that will only get better over time just not sure it justifies the high cost right now during ea

#####

currently 20 oct 2023 it is the equivalent of ksp1 v019 except far less playable

#####

kerbal space program 2 is in most ways a step down from the first 

however it is an an incredibly fertile soil something amazing can grow here with what we have if we are willing to give it time and have some patience 

its true that it was probably released too soon but we all know that it almost certainly wasnt the dev teams fault rather it was a decision made by people who neither care about the project or you and i 

i say if you dont have 50 dont buy it save your money for school books if you dont care about the project just go play something else but if you do have the money and you do care about ksp aerospace and aviation or space exploration then definitely give it a shot

i urge my fellow kerbalnauts to try to tone back the extremely negative criticisms about the game i know its easy and quite fun to levy harsh criticism but in this early stage private division will make important decisions about the games life based on how it performs right now 

yes its true we are probably getting the stick a bit but thats just life and we dont really get games of the quality of ksp much these days especially that cater to such a specific and hyper nerdy crowd 

i encourage everyone to be patient and let the game flourish if you do have criticism keep it constructive dont just hate on it for the fun of it 



#####

ksp is my favourite game of all time by a huge margin ive loved it for 9 years and followed the development of this sequel as closely as possible since the hour it was first announced

i have never been as disappointed in a game as i have been by ksp2

for 45 you get

crippled implementations of most features that have been done better by the first game repainting one of the only new features actually present is extremely poorly done both in terms of the visual result and from a usability perspective there is no way to even standardise more than 2 colours across a craft community made mods for the first game did this in a vastly more competent way

many of the new parts are badly retextured versions of the same models from the original game that ive already paid for the original artists largely arent credited for them either some of these are from as far back as 2012 it feels like they started out aiming to revamp everything and just gave up a little later

subpar graphics paired with a complete misunderstanding of ksps art style where craft used to be weathered and literally used theyre now absolutely spotless and void of detail in places they seem to aim for photorealism in others such as the kerbals themselves theyre practically cartoon characters with almost glowing fluorescent green skin pretty much all landed environments trees buildings etc look just beyond awful and ps2esque the post processing is terrible way too contrasty and oversaturated this is what hurts the most i think its just a downright ugly game 

a redesigned ui where every change was seemingly made for the sake of it and no other reason this is a running theme actually its visually extremely generic strangely low contrast so not very readable and assembled from a weird and ugly mix of pixel art a knock off minecraft font and smooth antialiased elements its also almost impossible to use in every scenario and exacerbated by bugs which mean half the time buttons simply do nothing when you click them i have no idea what they were thinking here plus its horrendously oversized and there is no way to adjust this

performance where to even start imagine the worst running game youve every played and times it by 3 or 4 they claim this will be improved i believe them because it genuinely could not be any worse i have an rtx 3060 ti and i711700k and dont break 40fps the majority of the time in the least demanding situations you can think of its beyond a joke

there are none of the promised features that justified a sequel in the first place yet and no timeline for their addition either i cant talk about them because theyre not there this game was supposed to come out in early 2020 i cant stress enough that contentwise they want you to buy vanilla ksp circa 2013 with glaring baffling qol omissions and magnitudes less polish and thought behind it 

in a handful and i mean literally just a handful of places there have been improvements made the sound design is mostly an upgrade new animations are good across the board most of the rocky planets and moons of the solar system look significantly better from orbit while staying authentic to the original game but thats pretty much it

its completely and utterly unrecommendable and inexcusable you can say its early access but this release is 3 years behind schedule intercept games have not delivered a successful product now and i have no faith that they will be able to in future

#####

this is another instance of early access being abused

the game is unfinished its not even a tech demo as large parts of the physics are either bugged or missing entirely  for example there are no reentry physics

so tired of being fucked over by expensive new releases

sigh
i didnt want to have to make this review

i was a fervent supporter of this game to the point where i ignored many warning signs during developments the takeover of star theory the multiple delays the lack of communication but i truly thought this game was going to come out of the gate and be at least as good as the original

it seems in my state blinded by trust i was mistaken

this game is a laggy buggy mess that is missing core features that should be in the game or have been added to the game after a few months yet nothing and the team is almost radio silence

i didnt play enough of the game to give you a review of the mechanics but i can talk about the things that changed visually 
    the new parts manager is obtuse and while it might have some uses it feels more like an optional feature than the only interface for interacting with much of your ships systems
    the entire feel of the ui has shifted and has lost a lot of its charm i also just think the style and change to the flight ui hurts more than it helps with so many players being used to the original
    graphically its not that bad but there are visual mods for the original that look and perform better with the only major exception being the volumetric clouds which might even be possible in the original game
   
there are a few things i can give the game
    i love a lot of the new parts i think they are a glimpse into what this game could and possibly can still be in the future
    the new procedural wings system is amazing and works fairly well barring a few things and allows for a lot of creativity

i havent even touched the surface of most reviews really im writing this more as an outlet for my disappointment 
i want to defend this game i really do but as of now im convinced that the team doesnt care about this project my guess is that the team was in over their heads and after years of development and funding issues they dont care enough anymore if someone told me private division cut the game before it was released but in order to recoup some development costs they released it in its current state i would believe it

ive requested a refund for this game though i doubt ill get it after all this time 
do yourself a favor wait to see if this game gets better or becomes abandonware even if it means you have to pay an extra 10 down the line

h1this game is borderline malware and the way it saves data has the potential to brick your computerh1

the developers decided that it would be a bigreatib idea to have the game save the pqs procedural quadtree sphere graphical data to the windows system registry at first i thought that the reports must be exaggerating  but when i opened up the registry editor win  r keys and went to computerhkey_current_usersoftwareintercept gameskerbal space program 2 i was horrified to see well over a hundred entries into the registry i havent seen any of my other software put anywhere near that much data into the registry 
h2urlhttpsmediadiscordappnetattachments3591691276522619001157118247712342126imagepngex651771d8is65162058hm5c4ea95579af80b2cc0442a0c50cc38e515d0c61753edd28253d8743d29cd105width738height671screenshot of it hereurlh2

i will have to do extensive research to figure out how i should go about removing it as one wrong deleted file could result in me bricking my pc i have heard reports that ksp 2 can when the registry gets full begin to overwrite windows files but have not been able to 100 confirm this

h1regardless any game that requires the deletion of key windows files in order to function is legitimately malwareh1
uif you have this game bstop playing and uninstall immediatelyb if you do not have it bdo not get itbu

i was already upset enough that the game is so barren and lacking in features over seven months after release  theres no science collection no career mode no contracts no missions no resource harvesting no eva construction no colonization nothing you literally can only wander aimlessly and plant flags thats it but i was originally going to just sit back and wait seeing that the game recently has lost the multiplayer tag on the store page is an ominous sign that seems to indicate that the developers have axed the planned multiplayer  which is half the reason why the game is supposed to be being made

but this new discovery that the game is storing files in such an obscenely biinsane mannerib to where ii cant even comprehend how the developers could mess up this badlyi has caused me to lose all faith in the development team news of this broke on the 24th of september and four days later there has not been a single statement from the developers anywhere in the steam community for something so utterly bugged that it can brick a persons pc and render their computer inoperable the lack of a timely response or patch is jawdroppingly incompetent this is so bad that it could potentially result in legal action against intercept games and there has been talks among some members of the community of filing a class action lawsuit for distribution of malicious software 

if the game wasnt so lacking in features and so buggy asis i would have thought that this was an intentional malware attack  but the developers at intercept games have proven that theyre so inept at programming a functional game that hanlons razor holds true in this regard 
h3never attribute to malice what that which is adequately explained by incompetenceh3
however incompetence is not an excuse for inaction once news broke that the game can brick peoples operating systems the developers should have responded immediately but they have not malware as a result of sheer incompetence in coding is still malware and is still extremely dangerous and harmful to peoples computers

i have already reported the game to steam for this and i suggest that all who read this do the same until the game is pulled from the store

tldr expensive but playable

for my original review after the first patch see the bottom

ive tested ksp2 for a few more hours since science mode was released and i can say it still lacks polish but at least its playable  you will encounter the occasional bug sometimes requiring a full relaunch of the game but these in my experience have been few and far between twice in 48 hours of gameplay 

science mode is not career it is just accumulating science points for research and nothing else you can build the most expensive rocket for the tiniest mission and its fine because theres no money yes i look forward to managing cash and the entire space program after all that is its name

this game is not a turd any more but it still smells its priced like a aaa game but its in early access a bit cheeky i think

conclusion if you loved ksp like me and put untold hours and hours into it then its probably time to sample this one but at full price its really hard to recommend get it on sale if you can

original review
i hear people saying it got better after the first patch like yeah it got better the turd has been polished but you cant polish a turd simply because its still a turd dont buy this game while its a turd you wouldnt pay for a turd ill change my review when its deturdified

#####

disclaimer i was granted a reviewkey of ksp2 without any signed contracts or limitations everything is 100 my own opinion

h1the next step in sandbox rocket building games has a very rocky runway to start onh1

is about as good as i can sum it up in one sentence ksp2 aims to improve the entire expierience of a previously proven formular intercept games wants to improve visuals physics new player onboarding and many more key features while also adding new systems like coloring procedrually generated parts and a much better building system however this whole endevour is starting out very rough around the edges the current early access version releases with an abundence of glitches bugs and problems ontop of performance that tanks even on the beefiest of systems

bthe first hour of gameplayb
by now i have done the following things
list
    build a four stage rocket
    fly it to the mun on my first try as well as landing it there
    falling over after eva deactivates sas so it does not stabilize itself anymore
    fly around the mun in eva and kill bill on purpose by crashing him into the ground at 100ms
    build a plane in the vab with the procedurally wing feature
    fly it around ksc
    crash it a few times
    test out the graphicsettings 1080p lowest vs 1440p highest settings
list
based on this expierience i can report the following positive and negative things

bpositiveb
list
    loading times are extremely fast comapred on same m2 like ksp1
    procedurally generated wings work flawlessly and are an awesome addition
    painting the rocket works very intuitively and is an awesome addition
    the new kerbal playermodels are very well done and the animations fun to watch
    the tutorial and introductive videos are amazing for new players and fun to watch
    improvements to the building of rockets are godsent especially the option to build multiple assemblies at once
    the pause function
list

bnegativeb
list
    visuals look pixelated especially edge smoothing seems to be nonexistant despite being on maximum settings
    performance regardless of resolution and settings are very bad in certain scenarios like when flying at the ksc however you can about double the frames outside of ksc by lowering settings
    nodes and other controlls are locked in pause mode despite being clickable elimating the usage of the function itself might have been a bug not sure
    no kerbal ragdolls see for yourself httpsclipstwitchtvproductivecoldbloodedtroutkappasyjjdz7yeecngdv3 
    no heat simulation will be available later
    no water simulation
    sun shines through the solid ground of the mun when you are in a crater
    nodeediting is harder than before but devs confirmed its a known issue that shouldnt be like that
    ui is extremely cluttered with no way of making it either smaller changing it or minimizing some elements like it was possible in ksp1
    
list


i tested the game on an rtx3080 an i9 13900k on 585645ghz paired with 2x16gb 3600mhz cl14 ram on a gen4 m2 ssd
launching from ksc even with the small airplane i made got me around 2030fps sometimes less regardless of graphic settings
once going above the clouds away from ksc its back to a good 60fps sometimes 7080fps but not really exceeding that

bconclusionb
an early access game is always a product you shouldnt actively compare to something that is clearly finished but setting expectations for your new game when it clearly isnt in the place it should be is also something you should not do the videoseries of ksp2 talked about many features and promised things like slaying the kraken and the big big addition of multiplayer basebuilding and what not releasing the game into early access without any of these things present obviously attracts negative attention sadly  the negativity goes beyond these topics stretching to things like performance and visual quality
for me personally i am excited to see where it all leads in due time ive already been here for the ride with ksp1 since way before it came to steam the main problem however ksp2 costs 50 which is almost full price of an aaa title and not a sandbox game releasing in early access this is the biggest issue overall for me you should not release a game this expensive with this little content and so many issues

wait for this game to mature if you dont want to test it for yourself

#####

scummy cashgrab 
half year after no major updates no heat no science no carrer no optimization just promises
the its how early access work  argument is not an excuse for charging 50 for such piece of garbage code early access model delivers features and content upon time in theory but  the company is not delivering anything but promises

and i didnt even started talking about 3 years of prior development and the game is almost done were squashing the lastest bugs news just to turn out to be an unplayable prealpha build with no features whatsoever

im fine paying and supporting alphastage game specially when its case of small indie studio
but im not fine paying full price for almost finished game just to receive this piece of trash specially when its case of full dev team with publisher im not fine hearing were about to add insertdesiredfeature for half of a year and get nothing 

do not buy it 
just play ksp1


#####

i had doubts before purchasing and those doubts turned into regrets
dont be like me

#####

i have been waiting on this game for years i am very disappointed with the early access everything that ksp 1 became was thrown away and replaced with a simplified gaming experience with a childish ui this game feels like the developers wanted to make a space game for kids and never really played ksp 1 everything is broken

#####

i realize its early access and i could respect that a lot of the content is on the roadmap and not in yet

however the game isnt what id call ready for early access even with a highend modern processor and a rtx 3090 the game has sub 30fps performance worse its jerky giving second long hard hangs in the editor around the space center and even when youre not around anything

there are things that i expected to be fixed in ksp2 that were problems in ksp1 but seemed to have been translated 11 into the new game as well the ui while improved in some ways is harmed in others so i equate this to neutral

the worst thing though is mods and modding arent supported and this was a huge setback since it was the army of modders and all the mods available on ckan that really made the first game shine the lack of this feels devestating to longterm prospects

im also not confident in this new teams ability to fix all the issues and the forced early release seems like a tactic done by the very large and notoriously greed publisher to claw back cash invested in the project i dont think early access for a massive corporation can be held to the same standards as an indie dev which finally pushes my review into the sad no territory

maybe the game will be improved and made to shine in several years maybe not i do not trust that it will happen but i will happily come back to revisit after a few years of dedicated patches and updates are shown i sadly expect it to get some halfhearted support rushed content updates to fill out the promised roadmap and then released from early access in a bad state

#####

offer refunds this is a tech demo not a game and should not even cost money at its current state
edit game okay now minor bugs but playable and worth the money it was just released to early

#####

much better after the first patch

#####

im leaving a positive review purely in hopes that take two doesnt decide to straight rip the funding entirely from this game because when and if its finished it iwilli be better than ksp 1 

for those who dont know private division had to release the game early to raise funds because take two refused them more funding thats why the game is in a broken borderline unplayable state right now 

take two find and consume the large pp you can find

#####

potential lots of it  but not yet worth pulling the trigger when there is so much content with ksp1

#####

science update totally changed the game  followed by the jan 29th patch just really helped polish out some pretty nasty bugs  its not perfect but its really solid  the missions are really well done and some are super hard for late game fun  really looking forward to colonies and interstellar updates  that will make ksp2 shine like a new star

#####

dont buy this until its

1 fully released
2 recent reviews are in and confirm the game is fixed

shame on the publisher for rushing this out the door and shame on the developer for ignoring key issues from the previous game and carrying them into ksp 2

i love ksp and whilst recommending dont buy this i have bought this with the hope it funds its development to completion  for now play ksp 1

#####

good low budget indie early access from billionaire taketwo

#####

fell through the moons surface with my lander performed an eva and got shot out the other side of the moon with over 70000 ms towards the sun went through the suns surface with over 100000 ms and somehow still stuck inside the sun apoapsis looping between 41 and 42 million km distance from the sun like what is going on here

ill be back in a couple of months

#####

rocky start but honestly after patch one i can say i enjoy the game the graphics are good and the sound design i adore little crunchy steps on minimus seems like the devs will keep supporting this game from what theyve said and from the multitude of improvements in patch one whether or not you buy it is ultimately up to you but i think that it is an enjoyable sequel to a gaming masterpiece that still manages to live up to the original in its core design and spirit

#####

tldr
recommended for people who want to taste a little bit of ksp2 in development and want to support the devs by giving them money
not recommended for people who want a stable and reliable ksp2 experience wait on it


i like what i see so far but truth be told the game is not really playable too many bugs and overall really unfinished here and there also 50 is a steep price to ask for at this state however i really like ksp and i am putting my money in just in hopes that this will deliver as much as ksp did in the future

#####

wait a bit a year or 2 

let them cook

#####

lol i paid 50 for a worse ksp1

#####

only buy if you want to beta test the game as a veteran player of ksp of 12 years with thousands of hours in the game this might be in worse shape than the original back in august of 2011 but being this late for release  originally slated for a 2020 release the devs wanted to put something out and thats what we have something this is not a completed game at times this isnt a playable game but if you want to take part in the active development of a sequel to a game that is still relevant 12 years after its release this is worth the admittedly high price of entry if you dont want to be a beta tester get the original game with all dlc its the same price and a completed game

#####

as someone with over 1000 hours in ksp 1 and played it since alpha in 2011

to start off let me tell everyone ksp 2 is not a complete game its been publicly announced as incomplete and anyone who knows the devs company knows they release in alpha get feedback from community and improve the title theyre full transparent with the audience with deadlines their intent and the path the game will take

that being said the game is not in an amazing state right now although anyone who played ksp 1 at launch knows that game was in a very similar state at initial release for such an ambitious idea for a game time is needed to make it stable fun and in their case easy to use 

ksp 2 is currently in that get feedback from the community and improve the title phase its by no means complete and id even say first release was almost unplayable until some fixes came out on youtube but some common issues that have been found in ksp 2 are as follows
rigidity issues with rockets bendy rockets
stages not decoupling properly
no deltav readout per stage
launch button occasionally not trigger countdown believe this is fixed in latest patch notes
lack of careerscience mode

many of those are glitches and bugs which are widely know the rigidity issue does infact have a fix you can change a setting in the games config files to boost how stable joints are although we shouldnt need to do this

now to highlight some of the things ksp has announced it will work towards with this title
planetary colonization with meaningful use
interstellar travel
future tech engines and modules
orbitaloffworld assembly of ships
different resources and means of gathering
multiplayer integrated into the gameno mods involved

on their website you can see the roadmap for the game as well as weekly updates from the dev team on what theyre doing

to conclude this all if you enjoyed the first game you will enjoy this one at some point when they improve on the game if you are new to the ksp franchise and see this and think that looks cool lets try it my recommendation would be try ksp 1 first i think right now its on sale for 10 and normally i think its still much less than ksp 2 but it will give you and idea of the potential of ksp 2 the possibilities for the title but in its current state i dont see this price point being very 
accessible to people just wanting to get into sandbox space exploration games even at early access to sum it up i think people are better off waiting to purchase ksp 2 until its complete and to add i think it is on the right path 

#####

first patch is a huge number of the launch bugs fixed  improved performance overall tremendous update in making the game feel right

#####

i do kinda wish steam had a ehsuggestion

its not bad it has issues yea but if your a ksp fan its a nice buy lots of toys and things to play with and its incredibly pretty to boot its missing some things from ksp one but i personally have high hopes for its development 

if ya want it wait for a sale

#####

ksp 1 but the all the content was traded for graphics

#####

i bought this game based purely on official information channels it was false advertising in its purest and most simple form

i have happily purchased many ea titles that had rocky starts but this is a different case they obfuscated the real state of the game dodged questions and over promised now they have released a game with basically no worthwhile content and a litany of bugs

honesty goes a long way and there has been a distinct lack of it from anyone involved with ksp 2 i genuinely dont believe they have a workforce with the skill set or vision to bring this game to a finished state



#####

one patch in two months do not buy this this is fraud
edit i have encountered savecorrupting bugs even in the vab i repeat do not buy this
update they are increasing the time between patches by 2 weeks lmao
edit this shitpost of a review got sevem awards so i will continue to update this with every new update 
edit six weeks six bloody weeks since the last patch this should not be legal the rewievs have dropped by 10 bloody percent
edit science eh better invest money into your real life rd for this game private division

#####

i foolishly thought id give this a chance after recent updates had gotten positive reviews i even unearthed a copy of windows just for this but almost a full year after release the game is still not playable bugs everywhere including gamebreaking ones rockets and rocket parts spawn and disappear randomly orbit indicators are a complete mess saves get corrupted kerbals glitch around during timewarp i could go on

graphics this is where the game is supposed to shine and yet its just slightly above meh better than ksp1 sure better by 10 years and multiple gpu generations absolutely not 

sound rocket sounds are fine but need some balancing the music is good at first but starts getting annoying after a few hours and i should add i have ears of steel never turned the music off in years of playing ksp 1

ui horrendous nothing is consistent as if every single component was designed by a different person nothing works smoothly even the simplest things are a hassle for example wanna close a window click on the x a random number of times might work might not some dont even have an x others do but the hitbox is so small youll miss it half the time same with buttons activate a stage by pressing space once or twice you never know 

content  functionality ive not played long enough to get a complete picture but so far it seems there is not a single thing that wasnt already  in ksp1 its more of a remaster than a version 2 and even that is overstating it at the moment many features of the original are downgraded or nonexistent like linux support  i know few people care but for me thats a big one 
a lot of money seems to have gone into fancy animations rather than programming and yet when it comes to tutorials and hints its still mostly walls of text i guess they decided tellshow 

performance seems to be ok overall i had no issues with upper midtier hardware but the loading screens are even worse than in ksp1 you really have to think twice before reverting from the launchpad 

tldr i regret buying this even on sale i know its in early access but it shouldnt be theyre not a 15 man crew in a garage anymore they have investors and a publisher and everything allowing big studios in ea is basically just asking for a grift and this is the result 
id recommend waiting but im also pessimistic about the future of this game it would require years of work to fix everything but this is a commercial enterprise not a labour of love as soon as the revenue starts drying up development will be over regardless of the state of the game so i guess the only thing thatll make it worth buying  barring a miracle  is when the price drops below 15

#####

look how they massacred my boy 

#####

if you played kerbal space program before it went early access on steam then you will appreciate this game alot it reminds me of build 09 alot the performance and gameplay are very simliar to ksp1 in early development the only drawback was i got ksp1 for free i still paid for the steam version anyway just to add it to my library but if you want to be a part of this games early development here is your opportunity to do so

pros good looking game from the space ship skins to the planetary ambiance with music for each planet to the rocket plumes and particles

cons sandbox only noodle rockets no water effects random glitches and wierdhappenings trip planning is difficult

grain of salt buy it knowing this is the worst stage of development it is ever going to be in just enough to call a game engine with a large upside for future upgrades

#####

i bought ksp2 after the science update so keep in mind ultimately the game very much feels early access the ui is very generic and font looks like it belongs in the 1980s the parts are also nearly a mirror of ksp1 so it does not feel like a new game but a retake on the original and prior to the aforementioned science update it seems like the only option was a sandbox game but with the science update there is starting to be a campaign and for those ksp1 vets i am happy to say time warp no longer breaks the physics of your ships and you can also now time warp under acceleration in vacuum  they also improved the map navigation guidance making it very easy to tell when you will encounter a new orbital body and you can now get an estimate on if your ship can make your destination prior to launch so in the end i am enjoying the game and would recommend it to hardcore ksp1 fans but i can see how people not as familiar with the original would feel this is not worth while in its current state

#####

like many longtime ksp 1 players i purchased ksp 2 on launch day and like many players it definitely didnt match my expectations even for early access in the end i have elected to give this game a thumbs up rather than a thumbs down why

1 well i think the development team get the overriding message by now that the launch didnt meet overall expectations for most players particularly given the asking price more care should have been put in to at least give a good 1st impression resolving fundamental issues and providing a reasonable performance most of these things i think could have been resolved for launch if handled in the right way personally i was most disappointed not to have science career mode and fuel generation to give an overriding incentive to get out there and to have something to build up on in my game

2 after persevering for a week i have still managed to get quite a lot out of it and i can really see the potential for the future based on what i have seen and the roadmap but i have experienced most of the bugs and performance issues that i have seen many people complain about so if that completely puts you off come back later 

3 despite everything ksp 2 was still a better experience than my first ksp 1 experience ksp 1 based on my 1st day of trying i didnt try again for about 2 years if i remember correctly due to experiencing worse performance issues and not really seeing what the point was at that stage


in terms of what i would like to see the focus on going forwards in order to give some constructive feedback

1 performance i have had the impression that the worst part of performance on my computer is more cpu related calculations on larger spacecraft than gpu based performance but i am hopeful that can be resolved

2 game stability resolving the worst bugs that are most frustrating players at the moment this includes things like ensuring players arent losing control of craft not having the cameras drifting wildly away from their craft on my craft i had the feeling this was occurring when i had wing elements on lower stages fyi and they continued to be included in the cog later well functioning dv and fuel calculations etc

3 maintaining game stability through qa processes

4 ensuring the most basic missing features are available for people to be able to run their missions effectively eg working manoeuvre visualisation through spheres of influence i only saw them working correctly 1 time in my game so far fine tuning manoeuvre nodes twr by stage etc theres a lot of low hanging fruit

5 modding support for what is there again this gives at least some incentive to start doing more with the game 

6 resource gathering this seems much too late in the roadmap right now at latest i think it should be available in with the colony creation but preferably earlier to create fuel to at least have a point to start having stations etc in other areas of the system and start running return trips more effectively 

7 working science  career mode not sure which of these makes most sense first

beyond that i think the roadmap progression makes sense

so overall a rocky start but one where i can see the potential of going forwards

#####

nope give it a year and drop the price by at least 25 for early adopters go try ksp until then

#####

realeased in a more unfinished state than most early access games do none of the core features boasted by dev team were in the game and still 6 months later no sign that we are getting them any time soon
a few examples
multiplayer
colony building
campaign mode
remodeled science system which now devs are saying they are going to essentially copy ksp1 science
orbital vehicle assembly or off planet vehicle construction
interstellar travel
no kraken then they said the kraken and wobbly rockets was intentional because its kerbal then they said they were unable to eliminate wobbly rockets and kraken at all
no need for auto struts as mentioned above wobbly rockets was something to be avoided or so the devs said and even though this is still an issue they still dont want to add an auto strut feature

i dont get it just have every item have a degree of autostrut to make them rigid till their failure point and have it as a hidden element of the game

devs have mentioned many many many times that they want this game to be more beginner friendly and not have to have insane game knowledge to complete tasks but this game is significantly harder to do anything beyond a mun or minmus mission than it was in ksp1 and even building a rocket or plane that isnt riddled with bugs is nearly impossible 

i played like 2 times when it first launched obviously was disappointed
then i just recently tried it again just to realize that nothing of value has actually been done 6 months later

at this rate if you buy this game it will surely sit in your library for years before its worth a play might as well just not buy it

#####

probably a better idea to wait to purchase this price sets expectations and its full price this isnt a minimum deliverable product it doesnt work well there are too many bugs its basically base ksp1 sandbox with better graphics only it barely works due to bugs no tech tree career missions but bugs lots of bugs

if they wanted people to test if for them it should have been for a much reduced price i think it will become the game people want eventually but the price will be the same then as it is now so why buy it now

#####

i am usually not one for writing reviews but i felt obligated for this long awaited title over 2 year postponement  while there are some good things about this game that cannot be denied such as better graphics and more parts customization  the fact remains that this game is full of bugs  corrupted save files falling through graphics  recovery issues numerous documented fuel issues lack there of andor a convoluted ui system which was streamlined in the original ksp a lack of any sort of career mode which helps guide your time especially to new players who private division was so excited and keen on getting involved  instead they throw players right into sand box with no knowledge on what parts can actually do  just throw parts together and hope for the best  yes there are tutorials which is a good addition if you are new to help guide you in the basic building and modifications but its lack luster to say the least my list of complaints can go on but enough is enough i have submitted at least 10 feedback reports in the last 24 hours and while it can be fun to explore the kss kerbal solar system right from the beginning of a new save file  i cant believe this is all we have after waiting over 2 years for a product  pd said they were waiting to release a quality product and this is not at all what the ksp community asked for or what pd said they were going to release we were patient and gave the benefit of the doubt to pd but they fell short of the high bar they set for themselves and the community  it seems to me like all other early access games it was a money grab because they were struggling and i hope they come through in the near future with what was promised  if you want to invest 50 in a game that might be good in the next year its worth your money if not play ksp download a few mods and youll enjoyment level will be exponentially increased in its current state i cannot recommend this product and have told my gaming friends who i had convinced to buy at release to wait till the product is worth their time and money 



#####

runs like a dead horse 


#####

youre not really buying a game right now youre mainly investing into a company that claims they will make this into a good game i wouldnt spend money on this for at least a year or two let them put the rest the game part into their game currently i would refund it if i could

#####

theres not even reentry heating effects 8 months after launch

#####

way behind ksp1 really feels like the devs havent played ksp1

#####

edit thanks for proving me wrong game is good  buy buy buy  seriously performs well no game breaking bugs beautiful worlds slight difficulty in exploration mode that limits your ability just on size restraints of parts and wiggly rockets no more seriously crazy turn around with news of an added maneuver tool glad to be a fan of this series

old8 months in still a buggy mess docking is an issue still weird graphical glitches black skys that eventually surround you 4k monitor has too small of text maneuver node is only pull so precision is difficult to achieve rockets just blow up randomly as if its colliding in  on itself the maneuver burn tells you to burn is always way too lateive done multiple missions but am installing a fresh version every update and can barely complete a simple mun trip without encountering a bug that waiting for the science updateremind me in 3 weeks

#####

at the current development rate it will probably come out of early access circa 20272028 if were lucky i got scammed dont buy this game

#####

i tried the game a few times before the update 15 and my experience was so negative i couldnt bring myself to buy the game even to support the devs especially at that price i really thought there was too much work to bring this game to be as good as ksp1 between the terrible performance lack of content and the negativity in this community i was sure that this game was going to be abandoned in a disastrous state 

im happy to say i was wrong there are still bugs but the content is coming little by little come on heat rentry and the performance is way better that before im talking double to triple the fps in a few month i can enjoy the game with small crafts at 90 fps ultra at 1440p with a 13600k and a 4070ti very decent

im regaining faith devs are doing a fantastic job to bring this game to a playable level im starting to enjoy it  i heard that investors pushed the game to be released and it was a big mistake i really hope this game can live its no mans sky moment

see you around jool girls and boys

#####

only buy if you are prepared to be what is essentially a beta tester the current early access build is buggy to the point that we are watching major youtubers struggle to even make it to the mun without experiencing major issues 

whether or not this development team will be able to deal with this mess or whether they will try to continue to build on an unfinished foundation is still to be seen wait until they prove that they can do the right thing and handle this larger project before committing your hard earned money

#####

ive played the early access from feb 20th for about 30 hours now it wasnt playable via steam had to start from the exe directly hence the discrepancy with the hours on record in steam

as lovely as the game is i highly recommend to wait for at least couple of months if not until next year over half of the time spend with the game is only fighting the bugs reloading save games and reverting to vab or to launch because of some weird glitch or bug that breaks the game or makes it impossible to play as intended several times the game completely freezes for 510 seconds every 1020 seconds 5800x 32gb ram rtx 3080 nvme ssd so you cant really play it for long without feeling deep frustration the longer you play the more agonizing and unstable it becomes

in addition to this the performance is not only early access bad its horrendous usually getting around 410 fps while launching a rocket checking my pc performance while playing cpu ram nor the gpu are stressed more than 4050 so the game is simply broken the vab glitches every minute while building a rocket camera jumps around at random parts dont react to clicking the game freezes for several seconds while selecting a part from the parts menu etc making the building process very painful all this with the glitching physics and rocket parts inflight is a nightmare to swim through fun at short times but only after a brutal long beating

just wait they will slowly build this game up during this year so unless you enjoy pushing splinters under your nails wait for the better version maybe another 6 months in the oven will make this lovely cupcake edible now its raw and tastes awful

#####

i have 500 hours in ksp1 and refunded ksp2 after about 20 minutes of play i might buy it later on sale but im not particularly faithful things will turn around with the current developer cuts and associated drama too bad i was really looking fwd to this title im just glad i can still play ksp1 which is a masterpiece kraken aside

#####

i did purchase this right out of the gate and well i played for about an hour and hung it up a lot of things that were mandatory for you to even get to orbit were broken  i did not even have the trajectory line to maneuver off of or see if i was going to miss the planet 
i just started playing it again just over a week ago it is fun now it does have a long way to go to get to the hype but it is early access looking at the giant tag just below where i am typing for reference the devs seem to really be working on the feed back provided seeing how the game has been refined in the few months it has been in early access is great 
should you get it depends
if you are willing to have an incomplete game from people that continuously worked on the previous iteration for like a decade that will likely never be a perfect game as they seem to be reaching for the stars literally with this game and be okay with that as it will be great fun trying to make theoretical interstellar travel as realistic as possible then this is the game for you get it play it give feed back wait update play it 
if you want a perfect game do not get it
if you do not want to deal with the feed back portion and you just want to wait until full release to complain that the game is not the way you want it to be then just wait 

if you can do better download unreal 5 and get to work it is free

#####

with ksp1 being a beloved game with 969 hours in it and years of fan art for it ksp2 is a complete incompetent bungle of a program what possible reason do you have to put object states and user settings into the system registry


#####

in the past i have found early access to be a good tool that benefits both the consumer and developer developer gets paid by beta testers to play the game early while the consumers get a discounted price for the game that will hopefully be completed

taketwo seems to have just gotten greedy here 

if you absolutely have to have a game first go for it it feels like earlybeta with most of the core features from the original missing while filled with bugs and highly unoptimized its disappointing as i was eagerly waiting for this but will now wait for full release as there is no benefit to early access

#####

let them cook

#####

so the developers tested the game on a supercomputer

#####

okay so much potential

i read all the detailed negative reviews like everyone else but i still couldnt help myself i tried it and wow

so of course disclaimer are there bugs yes even with the first patch out there are still plenty of glitches and many features are still missing early access so if you buy this game at the time of my writing this review treat it as a fun way to test this new ksp and watch it develop rather than expect a fully functioning game
well still have to wait a while before it becomes playable as intended

and yet despite this here are the reasons i cant help but be impressed as a ksp 1 player who has just tried ksp 2 for the first time

a nice mix of old and new its faithful to its predecessor and i was happy to find the good ol familiar parts the new interfaces took some getting used to but its the same core concept once you get the hang of it having said that i quite like the new fully customizable wings they did away with the pages and pages worth of wing parts to choose from now you can just design your own 1piece wing

i love the new kerbal space center it feels a lot bigger a lot more official and taking off and landing on the new runways give flight simulator vibes they redid the atmosphere and distance haze so the altitude feels more real the overall terrain textures are definitely impressive especially from a distance and as i understand it more texture updates are on the way

what guaranteed me giving this fledgling game a huge thumbsup aside from the obvious potential was the sun i built a small rocket to get into orbit and the moment i saw the kerbol star i literally exclaimed out loud its bright its radiant they rendered the rays and everything and it just hits different launch into a simple orbit and watch the sun rise on the horizon from space to see what i mean they did an amazing job capturing the feel of reallife videos that weve seen of similar events granted i play an unmodded and older version of ksp1 so perhaps graphicswise im easy to impress but still

kerbin from orbit is amazing the planets are lit differently the terminator line between day and night sides is sooo impressive i just love what they did with the lighting also watching the kscs continent as you get higher and higher it really feels like its the scale of a continent and again im used to an older unmodded version of ksp1 so they may have done this in later versions for all i know but still

so all the negative reviews youll read are probably true in terms of glitches but i cant help but be more excited than anything else at the amazing potential of ksp 2 sure there are plenty of problems and its in reeeealllly early access but whats already there is impressive enough on its own just imagine what this could become as new features roll out

full glitchfree game not yet
something to watch develop and have casual fun playing around with absolutely

#####

yeah give it a little big more time in the oven good though just not full price good yet

#####

early access does not deserve full price hardware requirements are bit out of reach for many players and it can tax 4070ti to 100 on 1920x1080 and somehow still manage looks like i smear vaseline on my monitor im not refunding because i have some hope but i do not recommend it for anybody right now because of the price if you want to play it just wait now its a mess

#####

this game is so unfinished and broken dont buy until they add colonies it will take 6 years

#####

update 672023  not only is there still no update to be seen the posts they keep pushing in their steam blog show they have no idea what theyre doing

on top of this their social media is currently pushing lgbt stuff when the game is targeted at little kids  red flag  not to mention they should be showing what their progress is not virtue signalling  another red flag

strikei fully expect this to turn around but the game isnt ready  feels like they wanted to charge 50 and have the community playtest for them and turn a profit instead of spending money on playtestersstrike

i have a bad feeling about this  ksp1 was made by one guy until the company he was working for decided to put more people on his project when they saw it could be profitable  look up felipe falanghe harvester and youll see articles about how he didnt even know ksp2 was being developed until it was announced and how it was sold off to take two  virtually none of the original creators are working on this game

anyway about the game itself

do not hit ctrl z in the vab it doesnt go back one step it deletes most of your work

very buggy  i keep getting mission failures the moment the vessel loads even though i can clearly see the vessel is fine so i have to revert to launch even though nothing broke and nothing failed

saving and loading your vessel is really really weird  when i revert to vab sometimes it loads the completely wrong vessel  then when i relaunch i notice i had extra kerbals in the crew capsule that i didnt assign  i also notice it creates tons of unneeded autosaves

also when you revert sometimes its midnight on the launch pad even if you went to the ksc time skipped to day then go to launch

just noticed i dont have any clouds  im hoping they regenerate if i relaunch the game

ill keep playingtesting when i can  you can tell the physics have been overhauled my designs that work in ksp1 are heavier and dont fly anywhere near the same in ksp2

sidenote  performance doesnt seem that bad on an i74790k 2080 super and 32gb ddr4  frames are just as good as ksp1 aside from when its being buggy

#####

for 3999 you too can have a modded ksp1 game that performs plays and looks better than ksp2 buy the original ksp2 is worth maybe 20 on a good day

#####

im not here to complain about the lack of features they were transparent about the fact there was a roadmap and not everything was going to be present day one

what i am going to heavily criticize is the sheer unplayable state of the game while all games should be expected to have bugs ksp2s day one state is atrocious its been almost 20 days since the games released and theres yet to be a patch to fix the unplayability

yes unplayability the game is not playable the bugs arent just the krakenwhich they claimed to have killed or silly little funny bugs these are bugs that literally prevent me from playing the game what is the point of me spending 70 bucks on a game only for me to be unable to play most of it i feel like game devs like these are using the term early access as an excuse for a broken game you cant just release a game for full price and make the excuse that your previous game was in early access

im sure ill be changing my review in a few years the promised content looks fun but i dont know how theyre going to do interstellar travel when simply trying to fly by the mun is broken as hell

#####

some of my previous reviews have been harsh but the game is progressing

#####

so i wanted to wait until the first patch to see how this game is i can say the devs are passionate about this game optimization of the game is now way better i am now convinced this game is going to be amazing with more content and patches coming up i highly recommend it

grab this review template here  httpsvojtastruhargithubiosteamreviewtemplate

unfortunately there are still too many bugs at the moment i was really hyped to buy it although i read the other critical comments i have a powerful pc rtx 3080 ti ryzen 5900x 32gb ram despite that it crashes often there are graphic errors such as shaking the camera then the game freezes and the colors gradient as if your own pc were about to crash ive played 3 hours so far and accepted the chances of a refund being applied is greatly reduced despite this i made an inquiry about it but i didnt get my money back so now i just wait until the game gets better 

#####

how i wish there was a neutral review on this website or better yet a star review system because at the moment i both like and dislike it
theres no questioning that the graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is as fun as the first game but the issue is the game is missing features that are already in ksp 1 im not complaining because the devs said it would be the case in the ea trailer 

at the moment id give the game a 510 ill stick to ksp 1 and continue to check out every update compared to where ksp1 was at this time during its development i cant exactly complain

#####

i really didnt want to have to say this but just go play ksp 1 for three or four months and see how this is doing then its a pretty but buggy shell of what ksp 1 is even without mods even ignoring the lack of several major features campaign mode any of the promises made during the hyped last three years the current state is genuinely just as empty as the earliest versions of ksp 1 just with a worse ui the ui has the potential to be better but its far too cluttered and hard to read to be considered better yet

wobbly rockets are back the node editor is very hard to use compared to ksp 1 the parts are very restricted and the performance is mediocre at best it uses 70 of a 4090 just to be cpu bottlenecked at 75fps i cant imagine how bad it is on low or even mid tier systems

please wait a few months or years before getting this game it really isnt even ready to be played yet ill be watching its development closely myself but unfortunately its not worth playing over the original yet at all

#####

its fun for what i like to do it was very buggy on release but its gotten much better i still dont recommend buying it yet as while it is now in a playable state it doesnt have much content and rockets are quite hard to build because of the wobbliness

overall i think the game just needs a second chance give it time to cook i can guarantee itll be a 5x better game in about 69 months


edit for v02 update

i was right as i thought the update came out today and its been spectacular so far with the current sale price  20  i would recommend trying it out you can get 2 hours of gameplay in and then decide if you really like it or not

also thanks for the steam points

#####

this game is a dumpster fire i dont know wtf theyve even been doing all this time but as it stands theyve managed to use the same graphics engine to make a worse version of the game and charge full price for it i feel like an idiot

#####

i have about 550 hours in ksp it is a part of my inspiration for getting a mechanical engineering degree so obviously i had to get ksp 2 this game shows a lot of promise but at the moment it is completely unplayable ive only attempted to do one mission so far i decided to do the jool 5 as a test to myself and the game since i would need a pretty complex craft so i will walk you through my experience 

specs 
gpu rtx3080
cpu i910850k
monitor 1440p 144hz
ram 32gb 

firstly they changed some things with how the vab controls all of which ive seen are objectively worse and incredibly frustrating i dont know who complained about the vab controls but it is complete garbage now i still have no idea how to move up and down my rocket it used to be shiftscroll wheel now it seems to be entirely random what i get to be focused on might be a bug but please if this is intentional give an option for legacy controls also no idea why they needed to over complicate the fairings what they had before was fine placing struts seems to randomly lag the game sometimes holding a single frame for so long i think it has crashed and then it comes back somehow worse than all that was the nonstop tutorial notifications that i thought i had said no to when i first started the game and there was no option i could find in the settings to turn them off

on the launch pad i was getting 20fps even while meeting or exceeding the recommended system requirements worse than that though my rocket was flopping around like it was made of rubber adding on even more struts did not fix this issue either somehow when i launched however it managed to fly straight so idk what that was about

once in space the sound design and most graphics were pretty awesome was getting about 50fps love the new navball and maneuver nodes gives me all the information i am looking for right there new exhaust cones are absolutely beautiful and have fantastic sound design when i was decoupling my boosters or first stage they also seemed to stick to my craft for some reason but a quicksave and load fixed it so it was fine i guess my main complaint is that if you zoom out to a medium distance your craft and all the planets look blurry not sure if its the antialiasing or something i tried messing with the settings but it just looked bad and considering the performance issues it was really confusing why it looked so awful looked great when you zoom in though

heres where the game goes from good to great to unplayable i went for a gravity assist around the mun when i heard the new sound track for it and maybe it was just really good timing but the music started to swell and build as i was getting closer and closer on my fly by and burn to jool

then i exited kerbins soi and was met with the stars sound track which was also very good
then i entered jools soi and was met its kinda of brassy jazzy sound track which fit perfectly then as i started my gravity capture assist with tylo i heard yet another new sound track and in that moment i was really excited because i realized that every single moon will have a new sound track me to listen to while i explore

then i tried undocking my lander and it flew off with an extra 300ms of delta v for no reason so i tried to reload the quicksave that i always make before i try to do things like that and it brought me back to the launch pad
this was extra confusing because as you may remember i had quick saved and quick loaded to unstick my stages when they wouldnt properly decouple i had done that several times and i religiously spam the f5 button after every maneuver and every action because i know these things happen all the time in ksp you simply can not play the game with an iron man mindset

so i go to manually load the save from the menu and sure enough there it is but when i go to load it completely corrupted my first flight my first save completely unplayable everything else i could deal with but i cant play the game if its going to be completely filled to the brim with game breaking bugs and not allow me to quick load after they happen

tldr
pros 
great music great sound design looks pretty sometimes
cons
no features significantly more buggy laggy awful vab controls horrible performance popups are constant and you cant get rid of them

#####

not worth the money yet i understand the concept of early access but this isnt even ready for that this feels more like a company that is having financial troubles grasping for a cash influx and praying for a miracle

#####

i cant believe im not recommending one of my favorite games sequel

whatever happened along the way with the buyout of the original studio has destroyed what premise they laid out in the beginning

ksp2 is not worth a purchase the patches are slow the notes are fluff there is nothing of substantial quality yet oh wow hey look we are back to ksp alpha with the kind of funding they have now the studio size and amount of workers it is absolutely a travesty  we are only 12 patches in and they are already slowing down this was a terrible purchase this game is but a skeleton of what ksp1 delivers dont even get me started about bugging ships in flight in space or the glitchy as heck vab these are important features that should be ready for use at this point but they are not like everything with this sequel everything is half baked

do not buy ksp2 do not buy ksp1 and mod it ksp2 is the perfect example of was not ready for early access this was get as much money as we can to recoup our losses so far

there is not even a science feature something every ksp player knows and loves now that the roadmap is changing already and patching coming slower they offer the community little do this in a barebones space

do not buy ksp2 buy ksp1 also f your piece of trash launcher no one wants to use your god damn launcher

#####

oh boy this is going to be like pulling teeth bbut i gotta do itb 

h2lets talk about early access and pricingh2

early access is for small studios or games that have an unfinished storyline 
i have played many early access titles and none were as broken as this one i mean i dont even want to call it unpolished because its more like a train wreck at this point and to make matters worse theyre charging full aaa game prices for it come on now bugs and missing features shouldnt be a thing in early access especially not at this price

h2speaking of missing featuresh2

listen i get it multiplayer and interstellar travel might not be ready yet but can we at least have some basic features like a decent twr indicator or the ability to use mods and dont even get me started on the fact that theres no reentry heating what kind of space simulator doesnt have that if you want a good space sim just go play ksp 1 its way better than this dumpster fire and lets not forget that this game got delayed like a hundred times maybe they shouldve delayed it some more

h2now lets talk performanceh2

okay so its not uncommon for early access titles to run a little wonky but i literally just bought a brand spankin new computer with an rtx 4080 just to play this game and well lets just say the graphics arent exactly mindblowing trees and surface scattering are despawning like crazy and the planets arent even that detailed where are all the cities and cool surface features even minecraft has a more diverse world than this it feels like they messed up the code somewhere and now theyre stuck in a rut this is not a good foundation for the future of interstellar travel folks

h2conclusionh2

look as a huge fan of ksp im just baffled that the developers of ksp 2 would let this game be released in its current state the ksp community was so positive and supportive and now were being handed this steaming pile of disappointment weve been played folks played like a cheap kazoo sad trumpet sound

h2update after patch 2h2

if the game keeps improving at the current pace the best we can hope for is some other studio building something similar  just better like citites skylines did for sim city

h2update after the sience updateh2

the game performs a little better but is far from finished i was able to land on all the planets and moons this time it is still very buggy and a lot of the basic features are missing you have to restart the game quite a few times if it doesnt restart itself by crashing so my recommendation to spend your valuable time with something else is still standing i bet half life 3 is gonna be released before this wobbly game is playable

#####

aight science update slaps hard 
not hard enough to cost 50 bucks but slaps nontheless

 new progression system is good it forces you to innovate and go further and further out of the
solar system

 performance is very good compared to year ago you still wont run it with 1050ti and i doubt you would run anything with it get better pc boy no money  skill issue

 bugs are endangered species not sure even if i encountered any 

 kraken is somehow dead for 12 hours of new gameplay i had no wobbly rockets

 bdarmory is not ported yet and i demand it here

 clouds still look like shit and they hired blackrack the fella responsible for stock volumetric clouds
  google those and compare them clouds to this inbred cousin of water vapor with mental disabilities in 140p because even fucking fxaa doesnt help with those pixelated stains of shit that they call fucking clouds those are not clouds those are a fucking parody of physics and aesthetics this is level of fucking
ace combat 5 and that game came out in 2004 and yes clouds are a personal issue
they add so much depth to the world and here with all this engine update game looks stunning but fucking clouds spoil everything i fly only to planets with no atmospheres just because of this this is madness insanity tasteless garbage that game implies are clouds and i want to puke everytime i see them aight end of mental breakdown i think you got the point

is it good direction yes
is it good enough to buy no i dont think so
should you wait for at least another update then yes
should you play ksp1 while waiting for colonies update absolutely


#####

i can forgive the lack of features but the abysmal optimization is ridiculous

fun game but probably best to wait

#####

shes a hot mess but i love her i keep walking away and then coming back thinking maybe shell be better this time

#####

tldr save your money  play ksp1  buy some mods for it  leave this pile of garbage alone  it might be excusable for 10 early access from an indie studio but this is a major publisher and i fear that they may not have the will to start over with this which is what seems like needs to happen  edit i do love ksp and i do hold hope that they will fix this but this level of early access is a poor excuse to meet an arbitrary public company timeline

i jumped at the early access even after seeing a 50 price tag  i loved ksp1 and have been waiting for ksp2  i read about the bugs  i have opinions saying that this game is unplayable  i didnt believe them but i should have  this game has way too many bugs to be released even as early access  early access should be playable but missing features  this game is borderline unplayable with the amount of bugs  the tutorials work and i was ready to play after that  everything else is so buggy as i can no longer argue with people who claim the game is unplayable

ship building  is so buggy that they even say dont use the undo function or else it will break your ship  symmetry building is buggy snap is buggy  but if you dont use the undo and are willing to reload a lot you can build a ship

flying  ok so the first weekly challenge is to land on the mun  good luck  

my first attempts reveal the buggy decouplers  if you decouple and activate an engine in the same stage the sections do not decouple  the engine starts but the sections to not detach  and because they have currently disabled wind resistance and thermal overload because they are buggy and not optimized the engines will not cause the attached piece to burn off so you are stuck with it  a lot of trial and error and i found that you simply need to decouple in one stage and start the engine in another but this was a common function that worked properly in ksp1 feels like no excuse to not have it work at this release  

orbiting  the game likes to just remove the trajectory lines from your orbiting craft  this happened a few times  i found a forum poster point out that the save file lists the craft as having landed and if you change it to orbiting then the trajectory lines come back  wow

docking  i like most people decide to recreate the apollo program with an orbiter and lander for my missing to the mun  after all we did this in ksp 1  so i get past all the other issues described previously  im in orbit around the mun i detach my lander and my vehicle has been destroyed would i like to start over  omg  i have not found a way around this

#####

it is insane that this game will sit with the multiplayer tag for yearswith absolutely no multiplayer

#####

needs a lot of work but each patch so far has made it ten times better i have no doubt that this game will eventually be even much better than ksp1

#####

not worth it at the moment

focus seems to have been on making it look and sound pretty over ensuring the early access release works
 basic functionality is missing
 kraken has occurred much more frequently multiple struts required on a rocket that shouldnt need any
 stability control isnt as strong as previous game barely functions
 manoeuvre nodes bugged out making it look like i was in an exit trajectory during when trying to circularize
 search doesnt list items youd expect

hold fire and wait for future patches ksp1 modded ksp1 both blow this out of the water at this point in time
the grounds for a good game are there but this needed much more work before a public release its definitely not worth its current price

overall disappointed but hopeful for the future

eh if you really want to play around with it its alright to buy now and play occasionally as updates roll out but if your really not dying to play it just wait for it to become more polished and feature complete its not unplayable but its lacking

#####

i have several hundred hours of flight time with ksp1 and am reviewing this game with several hours of prescience update and a few hours post  ill break this down into two reviews and will update if i run into anything that changes my mind 

newbies 

if you are interested in rockets and think kerbal might be for you then i can confidently say that ksp 2 is a good place to start  the game runs really well and the foundations of the systems are solid  you are buying into early access so there is some jank but the game will also grow with your capabilities  i started ksp 1 incredibly early in its beta pre steam and envy new players ability to watch a game develop along with their understanding and skills in the game   the game looks great and there is so much information provided for the player that there is always an answer for your problem  

if you are at all curious i would say go for it as long as you are okay with playing early access  i would not have said that about this game a month ago but its now at the stage where i can say it has a strong enough foundation to be genuinely fun  

why play kerbal  you will pretty much get an education in the fundamentals of orbital mechanics while remaining accessible and fun  i have several hundred hours in ksp 1 and can honestly say i have learned more from that game than any college course ive taken  if you have kids who you want to teach about science and the process of discovery i can also recommend this as a teaching tool that is fun and honestly pretty hilarious for kids  i play with my 6 year old and my two 3 year olds and they love this game  

they prefer ksp2 to ksp1 i think because of the visuals and sound  

veterans 
the game has stabilized immensely and will now be my primary place for playing the game  it is still early in development and they have a ways to go before they are at parity with ksp1 but a couple of my biggest gripes with the old engine have been addressed and i cannot go back  

stability in and out of warp spinning ships not turning into garbage the amount of information provided up from by the ui  i also think the game looks and sounds way better as well  i totally get why people would be uncomfortable dropping money on ksp2 if they have a fully modded and stable ksp1 and those people should probably wait  but i find this a better playing game and the way the engine handles warp and extreme physics much more bearable and cant go back 

if your biggest issue with the game at release was frame rate buddy ive got some great news for you  game runs like butter mostly now 

great job intercept

#####

game is good science fun tech tree progression is really good decent performance midrange pc performance only small frame drops on my setup the only bug i have encounter at time of playing was the loading screen not going away when i was launched i cannot seem to replicate this glitch it seems to happen randomly

#####

it makes me sad to say this game runs pretty terribly and i have a reasonably beefy computer hopefully the game gets more optimized in the future because i really want to enjoy it but for now i will refund it not worth fifty bucks

#####

after the first patch the game is significantly more playable and as a huge fan of ksp im glad i can finally recommend it

#####

early access is an understatement this game is years away from being in a beta phase early access releases should only be allowed to be published by indie game studios theres no excuse for a large publisher like take two interactive to launch a game in early development when they have the resources and capital to release completed games the game is unplayable in its current state and refunds should be granted as a huge kerbal space program fan i strongly advise not purchasing this sequel

#####

listen man i bought this fella on launch and it was not worth it now it got a bit better because of mods but buy this game when autostrut update comes ok

#####

come back in 3 years nothing to see here

update still not worth it wait two more years go play the first one in the meantime

#####

gettin there

#####

the game does not have the features nor optimization to justify a 50 price tag whether its ea or full release

i see a lot of individuals throwing around its in ea what did you expect i expected to get 50 worth while understanding that the new features that ksp2 was marketed for would be delayed

i expected that ksp1 is the base starting point
i expected thermodynamics to be active

maybe in the future i can recommend but as of today i do not recommend


for context on the state of optimization my setup is

ryzen 5900x
rtx 3080 12 gb
32 gb ram  3600 mhz

for 1080p high

i get 60 fps on launch padprior to launch and roughly 2030 fps during the launch

#####

hours not displayed due to playing before release

its just not as good as ksp 1 so why is it ready to enter early access disappointing and i really hope it improves with time

#####

it is definitely really early access i have hope for the future but dont buy it now if you expect a mostly functional game  edited review  they are moving too slowly so ive changed to not recommend maybe in the future that will change

#####

played for an hour so far seems to be ksp 1 with significant tutorial upgradesui enhancements i saw that other reviewers noted performance issues but i havent experienced anything aside from a small hangup when i opened the galaxy map during rocket ascension from kerbin

no campaign mode quite yet so id say buy this game if you liked the first game and wanted easier rocket controls

as i noted in my review for ksp 1 i dislike game launchers ksp 2 has said launcher you can bypass it by setting codedrivepath_tokerbal space program 2ksp2_x64exe commandcode in your launch options game properties  general options  launch options

example codecprogram files x86steamsteamappscommonkerbal space program 2ksp2_x64exe commandcode

#####

i have 1000s of hours in ksp 1 and waited months to post this review i cant in good conscious recommend this game at this time due to the total lack of feature parity and the speed of development id prefer they do an experimental mode with half baked features to get the community feedbackdata then the current trickle of new features i fully hope to be back here in 5 years to say the game has caught up to its own stated features but today this is no ksp 1 and doesnt look like it will be anytime soon

#####

did you like building rockets in ksp 1 go fuck yourself because we have a bug that has existed since 2013 where your ship turns into a dildo and violently wobbles what about planes well once again the block system of wings has been neutered and replaced with a less enjoyable less expansive system of jankly moving your mouse around to change the size and shape
or what if you wanted a new game with multiplayer base building and exploration why do you keep asking because none of the promises at launch have been carried out even after a whole year honestly after having owned and played ksp 1 since 2013 this is a terrible let down but the mods will choose to go onto instagram and post kerbals next to pride flags instead of working on the game to make us feel better about being fucked in the ass

#####

dont buy it yet bad preformance and a lot of bugs plague this game for now it is currently not worth 50 euros unlike bugs and bad preformance game design is unpatchable but that part of the game looks great just buy it when it has more features and better preformance for now wait a month or 2 before buying it is currently not worth it

#####

as someone having some fun with the game but also extensive experience in product development design and operations i cannot in good conscience recommend the game as it is a textbook case of poor product design this game serves as a poignant example of the pitfalls of neglecting core aspects of software development and quality assurance

performance a lone bright spot

acknowledging first the efforts made to optimize performance its clear that the team managed to address some of the critical challenges related to game performance on decent rigs this achievement shows a level of technical competence that deserves recognition without those improvements i likely would have never even purchased the game which does have its moments of fun

core gameplay and ui missed opportunities

however the commendations end there the games core mechanics and user interface are plagued with inconsistencies and usability issues ships inexplicably disintegrating in orbit or failing to render at all are symptoms of deeper systemic problems the ui compounds these issues with poorly thoughtout overlays and interactions that hinder rather than help gameplay these are exacerbated by the fact that very little can be done when the game is paused which would provide time to work around some of these challenges even loading in is inconsistent where one moment you have your ship then the next load in you have your ship and dozens of pieces floating around its akin to signing into your bank account and having 10k one minute then negative one million the next 

a call for embracing continuous delivery and quality assurance

the inconsistency in game behavior highlights a glaring omission in the development process a robust quality assurance and testing strategy drawing parallels to the notorious launch of cyberpunk and guided by the principles outlined by dave farley on the continous delivery youtube channel analyzing that failure its evident that continuous delivery and rigorous testing are not just optional they are essential and clearly missing from ksp2

farleys emphasis on the importance of these practices in preventing catastrophic product failures should be a wakeup call the variability in game performance and mechanics suggests that the development and product management teams at kerbal space program 2 have overlooked these critical elements of successful software development

recommendation for the team

its time for a candid reassessment of the teams approach to product development for those directly responsible for the oversight and direction of this project a period of reflection is necessary learning from industry experts like dave farley and understanding the failings of other highprofile projects could provide invaluable insights

investing in training on quality software design principles focusing on continuous delivery and implementing a culture of rigorous testing could transform the future of this game and others developed by the team for managers and product folk who have consistently overlooked or undervalued these principles it may be time to consider retraining or even transitioning to roles where the impact of such oversights is less critical

final thoughts

kerbal space program 2 had the potential to be a landmark title but its current state reflects a mismanagement of that potential the path forward involves a commitment to quality a dedication to continuous improvement and perhaps most importantly a willingness to learn from past mistakes only through embracing these changes can the team hope to restore faith in their abilities and deliver the experience that fans of this franchise truly deserve

that or consider a new career i hear mcdonalds is hiring

#####

running on a 3070 ran into some bugs but could still land on the mun
surely playable i would like to do some science and feel that love and job of progression

#####

get it play it report bugs make the game better
we all know whats coming is worth the growing pains we have seen whole planets that arent even in game yet so its not like they just havent been working they are just waiting to release things when they are ready to go but before anything we need to help get the foundation ironed out just like we did with ksp  bc frankly ive waited half a decade for this and im not about to say oh well i have to load a quicksave because my comm net wont connect 5 years not worth game garbo lol

b u t

if you are a new player go get ksp 1 install some visual mods and stay there for a while until ksp 2 gets some much needed bug fixes



edit after just short of a year i told you great game now still needs work and i cannot understate that the for science update has me back in now and its awesome cannot wait for the colony stuff to be added great work

h1this game is in early access  and is a fantastic foundation for the game weve been promisedh1

bi recommend this game based on my understanding of early access and the blatantly obvious potential this game has for further updates if you arent comfortable paying 45 for an early access title and arent willing to give constructive feedback do not buy it wait for future reviews confirming the game is in a state you likeb

b my specsb
cpu i5 8600k
gpu rtx 3050 8gb
ram 32gb 3200 mhz
storage samsung 980 evo

this gets me a stable 2030fps at high preset settings on 1080p

if you are using low tier hardware and want a good looking well performing polished game do what the devs have told us already  play ksp 1

if youre expecting a game that has slayed the kraken and are planning to buy this a day after launch reasses your understanding of what early access means

if youre looking to contribute to the game and help the developers build what we the community want to see and youre willing to put time into your feedback and deal with the occasional game breaking bugperformance issue then buy this game and give as much constructive feedback as you can

so ive played ksp since the early beta of ksp 1 and this really isnt as bad as a lot of reviews are making it out to be that said ksp 1 launched for around 7 back in 2011 not the 45 price tag this has been launched with which yes you get the full game for free but also its a very steep price to pay with the uncertainty of how the game will eventually turn out

devs if you read this ive put nonreview and hopefully constructive feedback at the bottom

the game has a vast amount of potential but the devs will need to move quickly to retain players as its already apparent a lot are disappointed then again early access is early access its not inteded to be a full release but a means for players to support the developers and provide constructive feedback on the game not spend an hour in day 1 livestreams complaining about how their 1050ti laptop isnt running a brand new early access title

so the meat and potatoes

bprosb
 the graphics are stunning the time put into the quality of the visuals  really shows

 the size of the vab is brilliant you wont struggle to fit ships in there although an even larger vab or a cool simulation vab for building models of insterstellar craft when that becomes a feature will be welcome as i cant see interstellar ships fitting in there

 the new ksc is fantastic ive found myself constantly flying around taking in the views of the new site and all the surrounding islands i can see the potential for additional airports etc either vanilla or modded to run some transport missions perhaps even incorporating it into collaborative multiplayer where you can transport rocket parts to other agencies

 the introduction of new fuels is welcome having high efficiency hydrogen engines is great although a variety in sizes other than small and xl will be welcome in future updates

bneutral pointsb
 performance in all honesty isnt that bad on midtier machines ive never played an early access game on mid teir hardware above 30fps and this game hits 2030fps in all stages of an apollo mun mission

 ui needs tweaking to be more user friendly i know enough from ksp 1 to move about somewhat okay but i suspect brand new players will struggle to get used to the long menus on even small vessels

 lack of content  now this is an interesting one as players have already data mined and found significant amounts of content held back that is near enough complete such as tech tree experiments parts data relating to interstellar ships and multiplayer functionality which youd hope the game was built around honestly i believe the devs have stuck to their word and have been honest the whole way through something other developers recently have failed at 10 launch this makes me hopeful that the day 1 storm no matter how quickly it grew will only be fleeting



bconsb  considering this is a day 1 early access review the only con in my opinion is the game breaking bugs that shouldve been found and patched in early testing that said they arent soul destroying as bug finding is also a large part of releasing in early access

 there are some fairly significant bugs which again ive written this on day 2 of launch but ive seen the ksc flying in space fuel draining from a kick stage and landing craft being drained into my first stag tanks despite crossfeed being off on the decouplers symmetry being wonky at times fairings not splitting in the vab so i can see the hidden vessel or sometimes glitching by being visible but not appearing when i launch or it will flash between being a complete fairing and a split fairing in the vab

h1feedback for the devsh1

 keep your communication open as promised youll be inundated with support request no doubt but keeping communication open in forums like the ksp sub reddit twitter youtube and of course your patchnotes in steam will keep the attention of a lot of us that havent been blinded with the fury of early access physics sim performance

 if the data miner is correct and a lot of the core mechanics are almost complete then even though it doesnt need to be said please get the tech tree and science unlocks released as soon as you can this will bring back the fun factor that a lot of people seem to be yearning for especially as it will give players something to focus their time and efforts on other than feeling theyre stuck in sandbox mode with no purpose to their efforts

 please please please provide us will multiple support channels on your website at least one for change requests and another for bug reportstech support it will allow players to efficiently submit changes theyve noticed in game  i have held back a few emails detailing changes that will be beneficial to all players but im not confident the support email is the right channel making this obvious will hopefully help us help you

 on a similar vein to the above if there isnt already documentation on it please provide us with some documentation on how youd like bug reports to be madeformatted some players may not actually know how to save their logs and save files and send them in an email and you guys will benefit from better formatting from us the players hopefully making the support desks job a little less tedious and a bit more efficient with escalations

 finally i dont think many people have actually said this but well done youve set fantastic foundations for what i can see as being a brilliant game when it hits version 1 a large portion of the community is understandably disappointed regarding performance and content but a lot of them dont seem to realise this is a fully rewritten game and not using original code to achieve something that is playable on day 1 with mid tier hardware i honestly think youve shown the intention to make this an exceptional sequel to the original game

#####

4 science has saved the gmae

#####

i do not suggest the game at this stage

 i cannot believe 3 years in dev and the game runs poorly as it does they cannot use the indie dev as an excuse anymore as its a bigger team with a publisher behind them

 i am running 3080 with 64 gigs of ram with a i9 11th gen cpu and when i built a small plane with 4 booster engines 4 small fuel tanks and 2 main fuel tanks for the main engine and it lags like hell

 i am sick of these early access thinking they can charge 50 bucks for a very poor quality game i was fine with missing features as its what ever but no excuse for the cost vs crappy optimization where its frustrating playing the game

 i do not get to even see the crashing or explosion very well as it jitters freezes etc during its crashing of the ship

#####

let them cook

#####

im going to start this review out with a couple of lines from steams early access faq

1 early access is a place for games that are in a playable alpha or beta state bare worth the current value of the playable buildb emphasis added

2 early access is bnotb meant to be a form of prepurchase emphasis added

3 you should aim to reward your early supporters and make them feel like their time and effort was worth it that doesnt necessarily mean your early access price is lower than your final release bbut try to provide some kind of value to your early access communityb emphasis added

so what does that mean well clearly the idea of early access is to provide people value for taking a chance on your iunfinishedi product 

there are many games that are in early access that end up entirely different from their finished product the original iteration of subnautica below zero was entirely different playstory wise than their finished product it had an early access price of 19 and a final sale price of 30 in other words the developers irewardedi early purchasers with a reduced price and a pretty solid base game as a thank you for the support

thus the trick with early access is appropriately assessing what the marketplace will tolerate the pricing for an  as of yet  unfinished game ie the buyer bknowsb theyre getting something iother thani the full game therefore one needs to do something iother thani charge the buyer full priceprepurchase price

and intercept games has shit the bed when it comes to that assessment 

not only is 50 arguably a transparently blatant abuse of the very idea of early access but it is so much so that it basically breaks #2 as it strains credulity to presume that intercept games is going to charge much more than 50 for the finished game and most aaa titles at 60 will give a 10 discount for prepurchasing the finished product a week before its released 

to be clear this isnt a review on the icontenti of an early access game and in my opinion if you rate an early access game negatively simply based on the unfinished nature and most people do this because of lack of content of the game you need to have a little tick on your profile akin to the vac tick for cheating because youre a different species of asshole but still under the same genus 

and while the content is lacking in this game compared to ksp 1  as will obviously be the case for an early access game  it would be easily looked over if the game werent priced out at what is essentially a prepurchase price for a finished game that is going to drop in a week 

add to this lazy optimization not as bad as its made out to be  i got a steady 40 fps regardless if i had one or ten engines running at the same time but weirdly it got worse in the trajectory screen so that needs to be fixed and stasiesque secondary launcher eula and what we have here is a perfect example of a developerpublisher hoovering up talent and creativity grinding it through mba beancounters and then 6sigma shitting out a product where they dont even care that theyre doing a terrible job of hiding the transparent early access cash grab abuse 

if this had been sold in early access for 2530 that would be one thing  and that thing would be an honest and fair use of early access  but since its 50 it gets a negative will it get better in the future probably but early access isnt a 401k and it shouldnt be treated as such

and yes i did request a refund

#####

so far i have been able to launch to space create a small space station and am designing an interplanetary craft now in the revamped vab the new building experience is soooo much better than designing subassemblies like in ksp1 the ui will take some getting used to but its not that different except for any kind of science and the modding potential ksp2 features have been pretty much like ksp1 for me as a stock sandbox player theres still easter eggs to find as well 

maybe ive been very lucky but have had a bug free experience i dont even meet the minimum specs and the game is playable for me is it 60 fps no but it is literally day 2 of a long ea process and i can still fly craft at 1540 fps on a 9 year old pc

ksp2 is not everything ksp1 is today but since this is early access i dont mind in relation to the 50 price if the game right now doesnt have enough for you to justify buying it then dont wait there is ample evidence of what is and what is not in the game based on the roadmap and compared to the original ksp the devs have been very clear weve also seen science mode file snippets in the code base so its not that far away but regardless watch how the game changes between now and the first content patch or bugfixes and reevaluate your opinion then 

i will update this review at 10 hrs

edit updated the review to share some fps numbers before the 0200 update this uses the same testing situations as the intercept games one with an rtx 2060 i513600k

edit 2 for science update fps numbers added i noticed i left vsync on so thats why my 0150 numbers are fixed at 60 fixed for the 020 testing

after the sceince update this game is so much better

graphics are a 1010

gameplay is a 910 point removed because we still are missing some stuff from ksp1 but its mostly here now

the game still has some bugs but its now playable and the bugs dont effect gameplay all to much

i think its safe to say  ksp2 pulled a nomans sky

btw im getting 3050 fps on a nvidia gtx 1660 super 
with mostly high graphics settings so the game is more optiomized now good job intercept and private division

#####

if you want to support the devs and have some extra money to spend i say get it but if you want a polished game for now get the first one

#####

i have played much of ksp1 and now ksp2 honestly it has it faults though i have seen significant progress with bugs and performance i have developed games in unity and unreal and will say bug fixing without causing another issue is difficult at times im holding out for the sciencethermal update i think this will start turning a lot of the negative reviews around a bit overall i have been able to land a decent sized rover on duna launch multiple probes create a realistic looking radio telescope space station and multiple mun landings in other words it is enjoyable for me to play and i think some dont give it a second chance

#####

barely 60 fps with just a basic rocket
nothing really new from ksp 1
bugs some of which are apparently like 1 year old still in the game that do not get fixed i experienced these within like 3 hours of starting the game
rockets spinning out of control after loading a safe i am talking about lander sized ones
maneuver nodes not showing because the game thinks you are landed
not being able to add or change maneuver nodes while paused
the wheels of planes being so bouncy you cannot get anything to take off
buttons getting stuck when you hold them while pressing escape or something
randomly not staging despite tapping space mutliple times
randomly not undocking when clicking undock
randomly not jettisoning fairings
randomly locking throttle while warp is higher than x1 despite not warping at all


i do not see what they improved uppon over ksp 1 they just made the performance worse and added bugs i wanted to like this game but this just is not it i am very disappointed

#####

more than 6 months already no big changes it just aint happening
give me back my 50 bucks

#####

a bit glitchy and not all the game mechanics are available yet overall playable and it has a lot of potential i look forward to the updates and further improvements as i loved the first one

#####

i was really really looking forward to this game coming out and by some miracle i managed to get this game without paying for it at all and i still cant rate it positively 

im just going to come right out and say it kerbal space program 2 is not a game yet this is not a beta test this is not just early access this is just straight up hey were releasing the foundations of the game for 50 while we continue to work on the other 95

will this game be insanely good like ksp1 in a few years time more than likely yes is it good now no not at all in a world where you can get ksp1 which is just this but far better albeit worse visually for 15th of the price on sale theres absolutely no reason you should purchase ksp 2 this early in development unless youre really confident in or want to support the devs 

510

#####

it sucks that it really wasnt release worthy when it did release but ive been playing the science update and it works now ive constantly got above 60 fps with a 4070ti

#####

first of all ksp2 is b e a u t i f u l the graphics of this game are very well done in almost all places soundtrack is also amazingly epic

its like the original so you can launch rockets fly to other planets blow stuff up put your kerbals in questionably safe situations etc it has more lag and more bugs than the original and im getting around 1020fps usually its playable for a simulation game with this level of detail but it is by no means buttery smooth it also seems to have a memory leak issue so restarting the game can sometimes cause performance to increase however im hopeful this will improve with time after all ksp1 took 10 years to get to where it is and ksp2 although building off the foundation of the original has gotten decently good and its actually fun to play and somewhat preferable to the original now over its first year 

pros
amazing graphics planets lighting space parts are all beautiful
epic soundtrack
ability to edit multiple subassemblies at once in the vab is a gamechanger
rockets go up
very well done at parts it seems they prioritized aesthetics over performance though but performance will get better with time especially as intercept games moves to a more efficient development structure

cons
the lag game can sometimes slow down 3 times compared to real time which is a huge pain
high specs required ryzen 5900hs and rtx3060 mobile on an rog zephyrus g14 will struggle


#####

i cannot recommend the game in its current state contentwise its similar to vanilla ksp without dlc however the game is full of bugs that make playing it a miserable experience for example parachutes sometimes dont work landing gear is unstable loading saves messes up parts of the vessel information in vab doesnt update immediately when you attach a part orbits arent always displayed correctly when transferring between celestial bodies

#####

getting better slowly  after 10 years of playing ksp1 i was pretty used to how things worked  after that long most things did work this new version has a lot of things that still dont work or dont work smoothly  the rover seat cant be evad from if there is anything near it making building small rovers pretty useless  the parts manager takes up a ton of screen space and is pretty clunky  the resource manager is even bigger  we should be able to shrink grow these  also the resource manager seems to be the only way to tell how much is in a tank during flight  i really miss the little boxes that could be pinned and showed how much was in a given tank  if every tank simply had the option of a small fuel gauge that was visible during flight that would save a lot of clutter on the screen and help with when to drop spare tanks 
lots of rambling i know but i was pretty disappointed  when this launched after so long with so many bugs and so few features  i know its a work in progress and its getting better but do we really need to wait another 10 years

#####

h1 worth it but there is a caveat h1 
updates are slowly rolling out not much has been added since launch almost a year ago however i do really enjoy the game a nice modern and more sleek version of the original game 

h2 to summarize h2
 if you dont want to worry with the hassles of an early access game stick to ksp1 if you dont mind the hiccups bugs or slow updates ksp2 is genuinely fun and definitely worth it

#####

if this game were 15 id say go for it but its not i know its early access but its still 50 and its just not worth that money when it runs so poorly i dont think you get to hide behind the early access banner when youre charging fullgame prices 

pass on it for now hopefully ill be able to recommend it once they fix it

edit i requested a refund after another hour of playtime the devs should be ashamed to have released a game in this state for this price its a total joke do not buy until they do some serious improvements 

im sure they will fix it in time but i had total faith in what seemed like a passionate team and i have been wholly disappointed they were interviewed and said with a straight face that they felt this game was worth 50 in its current state utterly shameful

#####

still not happy about them offering discounts ahead of v10 but it is what it is at the end of the day this game is fun it is really coming together and there is solid gameplay there it doesnt succeed anywhere ksp1 doesnt except for maybe the missions and progression in exploration mode

#####

i have to be honest kerbal 1 is my goto app to play it offers so much more than any other gamesimulator i have ever played i like games but many of them i can complete within 4872 hours and they seem to be a waste of money because they will never get any better there will never be any advancement just bug fixing
that being said i am an idiot i am a novice no matter how much i have played ksp1 i have played it for years  so dumb i couldnt tell you how many years  in that time ive only ever player around with travelling to duna and back yes that makes me an idiot and im ok with that ive enjoyed every single second of it failure or otherwise
i have been waiting for kerbal 2 for so very very long and last night  i waited up for it to be unlocked but im old as dirt and it was suggested to be unlocked at 12am at 1245 it was still locked so i went to bed and decided to buy it in the morning but when i woke up i saw all of the reviews and i was devastated i thought it was crap and a waste of money i spent most of today reading comments and trying to convince myself to buy  a program that so many people had a negative view of
but in the end i thought about how poorly ksp1 ran on my computer in the beginning compared to how awesome it is now and i decided to buy it 
after 20 minutes of gameplay i am glad i did buy it because 90 of what people are complaining about didnt happen to me sure i havent pushed it to its limits but so far it performs waaay better than ksp1 did for me for over a year and ksp1 turned out to be the best game ever
i dont deny people their right to be disappointed there are some control aspects that have changed that really annoys me because there was nothing wrong with the control method used before but im sure i can adapt
i dont own a super computer but so far the whole experience is smooth as silk to me  i spent around 2 years with 35 frames per second with ksp1 at launch and i was ok with that after many updates and a new computer it all smoothed out and was magic to me it was like a whole new game 
so yeah there are teething issues but in the end im certain it will be magical 
it just shows that reviews are not fact they are just a reflection of peoples expectations if people expect magic the ksp2 may disappoint at this stage but if you expect and endless list of failures and dont experience any of them then you will be pleasantly surprised

#####

ive been playing ksp 1 since the early years in its development and it started off quite like this with bugs and issues i fully believe that with time ksp 2 will be just as great or more with time


edit wow there is some serious salt in my comments i know its ea and i dont give a damn i genuinely see some promise in the game now is it perfect no is it good that its released with this many bugs and issues no not at all do i think it still can be good yeah i really do the devs have been very open and havent shut down criticism im thinking we are gonna see a no mans sky comeback

#####

i really want to like this game visuals are great onboarding is way better and the missons are great however in 3 out of 4 docking manouvers the collison model is not working properly and it results in chaos and spaceships or kerbals flying uncontrolled everywhere i am back to ksp 1 and will try again in 1 year

#####

my pc is going to explode and i am okay with that if it means playing this game


#####

its definitly early access but im certain that ill  happily spend 50 or a 100 hours messing around with it in the state its in right now  thats about a dollar an hour for entertainment  i see that as a bargain  if you dont then thats cool  wait until it has the features that will make it worth it for you

#####

still too bugged to play without frustration i love ksp and will keep checking back with every update but not up to ksp 1 quality as of today

#####

game is very buggy even after 1 year of release

just play ksp 1 and save you 

#####

dont just dont 
buy ksp 1 instead 
i would write a longer review but after playing this game for 30 mins i cant be bothered to put the effort in

ill be back in 12 years to see if its any better

ps i dont care about a countdown or the fact the default vessel name is fly safe 
stop adding bells and whistles to a turd and focus on the base game

yall need to learn how to read 

half these reviews are people complaining that it doesnt run well while their specs are well below the minimum specs listed on the page and yea those minimum specs are pretty high but the devs had addressed this before the game even released stating that they havent done much optimization yet and in my opinion for an early access game thats fine

the other half are people complaining that it doesnt have all the features of ksp 1 which you would also know if you read the road map which tells you whats in the game and whats coming later you have to remember ksp 1 is 12 years old and got consistent updates ksp 2 has had barely a third of that time in development 

its an early access game not the final release do you go on road trips and ask why arent we there yet as soon as you sit in the car in my opinion ksp 2 is in a really good state for early access seeing how the development of ksp 1 went i trust that the devs will continue building upon this and will make it into a much more enjoyable game if you dont mind waiting for that to happen its definitely worth buying if youre not go get ksp 1 which is also a great game

#####

it pains me to say this it really does i was fine with the lack of features no science no career thats fine i was happy to have revamped graphics and a new terrain system but this game was not ready for early access it is a frustratingly buggy mess and honestly i feel a little betrayed in all the dev logs the developers said  we are putting this into early access because we think it is fun and we cant stop playing it well they must have a different build because half of the people who bought this including myself are not having fun with this

crashes on launch not on mun not worth 50 to watch nothing happen
edit
set the graphics down to the minimum on my rtx3060 with my ultra wide screen got to place a probe module then crash reloaded crash reloaded saw the vab crash ive got an i76700k 4 ghz this should be buttery smooth very unoptimized will edit again after some updates as of now save your money

update #1
i have an ultrawide monitor playing in 1440 on borderless window seams to give me more wiggle room i made it to the mun then the game crashed went to load my save no save found still not worth 50 more updates to come

update #2
after about 10 hours in the game there are so many game breaking bugs such as the craft will start to spin out of control for no reason while the navball shows youre still heading in the right direction the kraken is alive and well and love to rip you stuff apart and the death wobble more than a few parts and your ship just wiggles itself to shreds still not worth a buy not worth 50

update #3
its been almost a week since i played i picked it up today with high hopes of a mun encounter i loaded in a pre built ship and headed off got into low kerbin orbit just fine switched to the map mode to plan my maneuver when i went back to my ship i found it spinning like a top and out of control altf4 cries ill check back in a week or so again what a waste of time and money jeb sad

#####

yup  early access  made it to the mun lander fell over and fell through surface then when i tried passing back through mun  big bada boom   some control issues partially from my poor design but just a bit frustrating at the moment
gladly waiting for some polishing     


#####

as of right now this game has become fun it will be even better with the next updates but right now its almost at feature parity with ksp1 in a less crowded easier to learn cleaner package that makes we want to discover all the planets again so much has been done in terms of quality of life compared to ksp1 that i cant see myself going back to it again like being able to set deltav calculations of each stage to any altitude or space individually or free camera movement in the map view the tech tree is great and makes sense too exploration mode is also a clear upgrade from both science and career mode in ksp1 the missions are much more like milestones and less do x thing at y altitude on z planet

if youre still unsure wait a couple of months every update has brought massive improvements so far and they will almost certainly continue to do so

#####

i wouldnt even call this a minimum viable product almost seven months after early access release reentry heating remains an immanent feature developer is clearly not prioritizing the early access experience

#####

should not have been released in such a state game is full of missing features and updates are coming out too slowly

#####

still not ready

thought id give it a go with the new science update and the first thing i noticed was  theres still no actual career mode with anything resembling the concept of money there are no financial restrictions to completing the objectives mission control gives you so nothing is stopping you from just building megarockets to do everything 

but what really kills this game are the bugs still i was in a circular lunar orbit around 10km and i noticed my orbit was decaying for some unknown reason requiring me to spend fuel to maintain the orbit until i was ready to land where i wanted to after landing i went to take off and the game never recognised that the craft took off reporting my location as landed this meant that my flight path wasnt shown on the map and i couldnt make maneuver nodes to help circularize my lunar orbit after taking off there was no hope of getting lucky and getting back to kerbin without maneuver nodes with my 850 ms left of fuel eventually my orbit again randomly decayed for no reason the mun doesnt have an atmosphere last time i checked and my lander crashed into the mun and exploded

there have been weird staging bugs decoupler bugs for some reason whenever you select a craft to control from the tracking center when it brings up control of the vessel it does so with 100 throttle numerous things like this

i got to have a little bit of fun but it was immediately dashed by gameplay problems i dont think im going to come back to ksp2 for at least another 6 months but my guess is itll take a lot longer than that for them to come up with something i enjoy half as much as ksp1 dont buy it yet

#####

rocket go in space space is mean you hate space so you keep trying to get past space turns out you cant escape space so you cry then you come back with understanding understanding leads to better bigger flyier rockets those rockets send little green man to mars mars eats little green man and you never get him back rocket go in space

#####

the bugs that stopped me playing previously have mostly been fixed yes there are still bugs to be fixed but its much better and actually playable thoroughly enjoy this game now

#####

ill be 100 honest and blunt some of the bugs make me wonder if they even played the game or if they pushed the wrong build to steam because man it is bad

manoeuvre nodes simply dont work once you leave kerbin
joints are made out of rubber so even a straight rocket will start to wobble like a string worm
rreverting to launch with rockets makes the launch tower clip into your rocket you need to revert to vab and launch again

#####

its not a fun experience yet  needless to say this was too early for even early access  its buggy and the peformance is terrible  and the amount of load screens for will drive you insane  want to revert back to vab load screen  want to launch load screen oh you made a mistake with your vessel go back to vab load screen   i cannot recommend this game right now give it a couple of years

#####

played for a bit got bored of it as it was basically ksp 1 with less features and refunded it it has a lot of potential but a game that is missing so much after being in development so long plus demanding such a price for an incomplete program is idiotic and absurd im tired of seeing this shit in video games fuck early access actually finish your games for once your team is clearly passionate so put some fucking effort into this all in all i wont recommend this game for the state its in

#####

still fun

#####

after the for science update ive been having more fun with this than ksp 1 the missions are so much better i never feel lost or bored like i did with the first game the tech tree is also organized in a more fun and fair way the game runs very well and wobbly rockets are gone there are still some bugs especially with the ui but the game is still in early access i just wish there was a linux version

#####

after having almost 1000 hours in ksp 1 i thought this game would be a steal for 50 i had a good amount of faith in the developers to bring an amazing sequel to the table or so i thought the first issue was after the announcement for the game being released in early access i thought to myself that the game wasnt fully finished but ill still give it a shot nearing the time of release we the community were told that none of the ksp 2 features such as interstellar new planets colonies etc were not going to be apart of launch and that a roadmap with all of the features would eventually release with 10 the game was going to be much closer to ksp 1 again i thought to myself thats fine because the game will release and we will have a solid foundation and be able to provide the devs with how we want the game to end up 

release day comes and well not much no science no temperaturereentry effects and about as many bugs as cyberpunkno mans sky on launch okay theyll buff out these issues in a few daysweeks and things will be much better i said i was wrong 6 months and 4 patches later and i still cant launch a medium sized rocket into space without it blowing up into a million pieces flailing out of control or inability to dock because of random krakenlike issues i thought the kraken was slayed  the game is roughly 13rd of what ksp 1 is bugs bugs bugs

these are just some of my issues as this game progresses

 wobbly rockets why was this thing a feature in the first place
 sasrcs is abysmal how am i able to turn future interstellar ships with weak sasrcs
 wings wobble like crazy with sas
 clipping part breaks nearly everything
 camera issues
 decaying orbits
 wobbly rockets
 a decent amount of vab issues like symmetry and graphical issues
 graphical artifacts at high settings running a 4080 and a 13900k
 settings not properly saving 
 ui is not consistent among the different features
 workspaces are broken just make the same feature as ksp 1 but allow multiple crafts to be made 
 lower fps on highend hardware
 crafts not saving properly or overwriting each other
 wobbly rockets 

i am able to take all of these with a grain of salt because the game is in early access however b i do not think this game is worth 50 nor would i recommend it to anyone right now b with how slow the development is i would expect the game to be at 10 aka all of the features the devs want in about 23 years i sit here typing this out because my frustration finally exceeded the acceptable amount of issues i have with this sequel i tried the game at launch was an alpha now its a slightly playable alpha 210

#####

this game has huge potential and with a passionate fanbase and many brilliant people from the ksp1 modding days on the dev team namely blackrack for atmospherics including scatterer and volumetric clouds and anth for bug reporting and qa id say this game will reach its potential and with the for science update coming on dec 19th bringing science reentry vfx and heating systems as well as a whole slew of other features and an as of yet massive list of bug fixes the for science update will be the one to save this game

#####

absolutely not ready to be prereleased its lacking so many basic features i was so excited for this release but i was really let down back to ksp 1 

dont buy this yet

#####

let them cook
played a bunch of ksp 1 on and off steam followed ksp 2s development and payed 50 on launch date 
very broken almost unplayable worth every dollar 
ksp 1 took its long long time to get good and filled with content ksp 2 right now is for people who want to support the game financially and are ready for that long ride to perfection 
dont buy it if you want to try out ksp games get the first one and dont shit on ksp 2 cause it was super clear how unfinished and early access this game is if not sure go on youtube or ask for a refund 
meanwhile this game right now is still fun and the struggle can add some new challenge that hasnt been been seen in the original for a while now glhf

#####

its extremely unfortunate that the sequel to my favorite game of all time is this
the potential was there for greatness and it falls short in every single aspect it hurts me to type this after playing ksp 1 for over a decade but this game should not exist right now just play the first one with some mods and youll get a much better experience 
im hoping to update this in a few years and maybe itll be the game it was meant to be but for right now definitely dont buy this

#####

i was so hyped for this game and it is beautiful but thats all it is it openly rips off previous mod creators with no credit it has less than 13rd of the features promised for launch and in the short time that ive played it ive encountered 13 bugs in a total of 213 instances these bugs include but are not limited to

the ksc suddenly being in space 
gravity deciding to turn off 
no atmosphere
engines just not turning on
broken staging 
not being able to create flight plans
quick save crashing the game
save files not being able to save

just to name a few it breaks my heart to say this but this entire game and marketing campaign was a cash grab with no real intent to deliver do not buy this game just get visual and audio mod packs for ksp 1 youd expect these kinds of issues maybe the first week but not more than a year after launch my utter disappointment and dissatisfaction cannot be properly conveyed in just words waste of your time and money i promise

#####

this should not have been released in its current build 

im generally forgiving when it comes to early access games some of my favorite games are still in early access but when you have performance issues that affect even the highest end computers yall gotta reevaluate the launch date 

the bad 
ui personal opinion 
perfomance 
terrain rendering
physics bugs
missing features not too annoying they told us they werent going to be there 
vab stage management 
vab part thumbnails are an eyesore
vab part menu jitters quite a lot when scrolling through it 
 the destroy button being in the same place as the focus button for every other celestial object who thought that was a good idea lmao

the good 
countdowns for launching s
vab deltav trip planner s 
being able to detach parts from detached sections in vab s
xl parts

theres a lot of great quality of life changes the problem is with the performance and rending issues it has coupled with the missing features theres no reason to play this over ksp1 a modded ksp1 will run and look better ksp2 will be a great game just in another 34 years 

cya in 2027

#####

bought on 20 discount right after the patch 130 hoped that it will be better than on start and in some portions it really is but in a lot of aspects its still not even an alpha the game is still pretty much unplayable the framerate is terrible even on a decent machine so probably currently will perform relatively ok only on the very top hardware aerobraking is not working at all  no way to return your spacemen from space the rockets are still spagetti vobbling around if there are any joints the camera is still not great with a lot of bugs ill wait another 46 months probably before attempting it again

#####

why the hell is the destroy button right below the focus button

#####

buy it if it gets fixed otherwise leave it alone imop
we should hold developers and publishers accountable 
where you put your money for a product should be valued 
loyalty to a developer isnt enough to justify a early access game for a triple a games price
why should you pay more for being a betatester

with that said if this turns into a well developed game with a vision as promised it would change my review kinda
still not happy paying full price for investing in something that isnt a full product at current time and date

#####

game is already on sale fuck the early access supporters i guess

dont buy this garbage

#####

absolutely abysmal performance for such simple graphics the new ui was superb and the game itself might just be great but dont expect to get good performance out of this game my pc is 6900 xt gpu and 5800 x cpu and i got 30 fps during launch with less then 10 parts

#####

nearly 6 months since release and virtually zero progress on any of the roadmap items promised by the devs

#####

certainly very early access its a barebones version of ksp 1 with nicer graphics as of now there is nothing to do you explore for the sake of it there is no resources science progression or anything like that i cant really say this is worthg the price tag as of now it has been in development for a long time and who knows how much longer it will be likely many years

#####

very much a wip in at the moment be aware

#####

edit they turned it around so im changing my review from negative to positive

well i cant believe im writing this but they did it they pulled out of the nosedive albeit almost a calendar year after release

the new science update has saved the game this is how they should have released this game from the beginning but honestly ill take it i had no faith in them fixing the game before going bust and shutting down but somehow they fixed it its not perfect no but it is enjoyable to play finally there are some minor bugs they will iron out but so far ive logged easily dozens of hours since the update and cant put it down you wont put it down either

well done devs

#####

dont just dont go buy ksp1 and install some mods with a mod manager this game needs another 3 years for all these soontm updates

#####

it good now

#####

vab building controls are quite terrible and breaks constantly several aircraft saves corrupted flight controls are very unfriendly for keyboard players and are more onoff than hold for x time before max out settings lack sensitivity sliders for vab and other things etc currently in a state lesser than ksp1 has nasty privacy policy and tos eulas not to mention windows defender seriously does not like the internet traffic from ksp2 wtf is it trying to phone home lets also mention that they try to force you to sign up for an account and force a launcher down your throat screw that wait for release and let them cook cheer em on preordering is a terrible idea and only leads to disappointment and rewarding bad dev behavior i think ill refund this just wait and see if this is worth buying on sale when theyve reached the finish line

#####

feels like a strange knockoff mobile port of ksp 1
also dont forget this game harvests every single piece of information it can off of your computer

overpriced trash

#####

love this game i struggled hard on ksp 1 not understanding how to make vroom not go boom but still kept playing it cause even though i only went 1200m into the air before catastrophic failure occurred it was still funny to watch everything go to hell highly exaggerating there i made it to mun but not much farther
as for ksp 2 i feel like i got a better grasp of things quicker than i had with the first game and within only 11 hours of gameplay have made it much further than i had on ksp 1
ive gone through and read a lot of the reviews most if not all of the recommended reviews were helpful funny and really supported the dev team while most of the not recommended reviews compare this to full release ksp 1 and even modded ksp 1 as if there isnt a huge banner just above the price tag that says early access game much of it is no were near helpful either want the game to be better reach out and talk to the devs dont just complain about it if you feel this game wasnt worth it and didnt reach out or try to be a part of the solution id say thats your fault at that point i also agree with my brother that id rather pay 50 usd for the game while still in early access and help it along rather than pay for every update that comes out in the future
as a variety streamer i play a lot of early access games and i am on a lot of developer public discord servers do i get bugs from ea games yeah all the dam time does the game sometimes crash when its in ea yes sometimes often when these issues happen i talk to the support or dev team send them recordings help them recreate it so they can fix it ksp 2 has honestly handled a lot better than many of the early access games ive played is there still room for it to grow of course otherwise it wouldnt still say early access
all in all this is an awesome game that i have enjoyed playing in my free time dont get me wrong though vroom still go boom just not as often and its just as funny as before

#####

i know ksp 2 has been receiving some rough reviews and its not that i can disagree but the recent updates have been amazing and are truly improving the game the fps when leaving kerbin atmosphere has increased to a very much acceptable level also a huge thing for me is im not encountering gameending glitches every hour the general playing of the game is just much more of an enjoyable experience

#####

recommended if you have a good computer it seems the devs are going in the right direction now the for science update is essential for this games survival the new atmospheres look amazing due to blackracks work if you are below a certain benchmark equipmentwise the game will not run at all

#####


i never played ksp1 

i understand that there is many bug due to early access state of the game i manage to land on both moon arround kerbin the bug made me rage quit few time after spending hours building a rocket with a rover attached to it but i ended up very very happy once i landed both the rover and the lander

so yes a do recommend the game but if you want a working game maybe wait few months so the fixes make it more enjoyable 



#####

this game simply isnt worth buying at the current stage of development

certain elements of the game are an upgrade over the original and the graphics are a little nicer but overall its just a huge disappointment if youre thinking about buying it dont just keep playing the original for the time being maybe it will be worth it in the future but that wont be for a while yet

#####

the game is extremely broken and empty sure its in early access but private division should be ashamed to release a game in this state it needs at least a year of development to bring it to half of what ksp1 is the game lacks content is glitchy af and runs pretty terribly

#####

ksp2 is a sequel whose promise is establishing a sleeker stabler engine to be built upon than the original whose community built features abound but suffer from bloated loading times and difficult setup

what they have shown thus far betrays a total inability to deliver on that promise the bugs experienced in this barebones outline of a game are best described as comprehensive by their own admission multiple major systems need to be completely redone in order for the game to be performant yet 7 months on we dont even have the basics of reentry heating enabled in the game a feature that surprised everyone in its omission and would be the very first added since ea launch 

make no mistake what is enabled is a dysfunctional mess with serious optimization issues one can only imagine how badly the parts of the project are going that they arent even willing to show

save your money and while youre at it write down the names involved in this farce for next time

#####

 early access so low content
 no optimization
 absolutely unplayable for now
 so many problem with constructor


 i like it will my best mistress



absolute disaster for now
developers why did you open sales its complete rubbish

#####

no career mode yet i know is early access but this is barely the skeleton of a ksp game not worth 50 this game at this state worth 20 at best maybe when it is finished will worth its current price

besides that the game is nice and still have that ksp fun with bugs and all had a laugh when ksc appeared in orbit along the ship from the tutorial


urlhttpsyoutubebvteqifeupqhttpsyoutubebvteqifeupqurl

#####

i dont know how to feel about their decision to go early access they clearly have more content that works but isnt added to the release yet from what i can tell there is no new content aside from a couple tweaks to the ui performance is unacceptable for a 3500 pc that said they had to have a very strong motivation behind releasing this early knowing it would be very poorly received maybe there are issues in the financial department when the bones of the project dont function properly they generally dont get better with time the performance issues will be a problem all the way up to the release when maybe molders can figure it out

#####

ksp2 definitely wont be for everyone in its current state on a personal level though im really enjoying my time in it seeing as the game has basically been rewritten from the ground up rather than just being built on top of the original game in order to futureproof for additional features im honestly impressed with the state that it is in at this stage game development takes a long time especially when half of your development period takes place during the covid19 pandemic 

in terms of current content the game is in a similar state that ksp1 was within its first few years of public release 2013ish but the game has a number of performance and stability issues the developers are clearly passionate about the project as well which gives me hope that theyll be able to work out all the bugs and optimization issues as time goes on and i also hope that such fixes wont delay new content updates too much

i think the best indicator for how development will be handled postea release will be to look for how quickly hotfix patches are released for current critical issues and how the first major content update goes later on its way too early to tell how the game will turn out otherwise

#####

i absolutely loved ksp 1 and i have never written a review for a game in my life but this is the saddest attempt at a sequel to a great game i have ever seen in my life it looks and feels like it was built with qbasic the interface is too small nothing works the way it is supposed to the tutorials are more annoying than helpful and it feels like this should have been ksp 1 and ksp 1 should have been the second its truly that pathetic in terms of execution im sure some of you know more about why this happened but it feels like they just got the rights and said the first one sold so lets just throw out some garbage and people will buy it because they liked the first one this game could have been fantasticbut noand unfortunately it is so far from fantastic its not even good at this point early release or not its an absolute joke i would love to plead with them to fix this monstrosity but i truly dont think they are capable of it

#####

the rocket still go up

#####

tldr 
give it a while longer to work out kinks  its playable and fun but lacks a lot of the polish that ksp1 has

the long
my qualifications ive played ksp1 offandon since i picked it up after v0235 in february 2014  i basically played it nonstop for a few months thereafter and have run four different modded scenarios of it until 2022  ive probably logged thousands of hours in the game not reflected by steam due to the regularity of updates and how those updates can break gamesmods with earlier versions  my longestrun game spanned from 2016 to 2019 exploring the base system  outer planets mod also upgrading from 105 initially to 113 for that 64bit support  yes there were issues also the game took so long because only the first year was dedicated  in 2017 it started to share time with a gpp 130 game  needless to say im familiar with ksp1 and how it works and what can be done
general review ksp2 is extremely pretty  it seems very very friendly to new players  the layout of the space center is nice with multiple launch pads the maneuver assistant is helpful if not completely reliable and the ui data is generally a good upgrade once you get used to it  the tech tree is interestingly divided into four tiers that mostly make sense for what one wouldshould be doing during that tier  also science is a bit more simplified which has so far seemed balanced
however there are some things that ksp2 lacks that make it hard to play for the experienced ksp1 player
while the ui resizing works well it does not apply to all aspects of the ui  namely the parts manager  this hurts gameplay because the default ui size is a bit on the bulky side and the parts manager can get very busy  while on the parts manager there is absolutely no data for fuel tanks offered therein  while this is fine for a simple rocket and the staging shows fuel well enough to even use asparagus staging it provides no benefit for detachable fueltanks and completely disables the ability to use fuel crossfeed in short ksp2 robs you of vessel reusability since you cannot transfer fuel from one vessel to another  you cant even transfer fuel between tanks on the same vessel in the case one might want to rebalance their vessels fuel  as a player that has a tendency to haul too much fuel into orbit and wants to use one vessel for multiple missions ie regular crew transport between stations or multiple landings from an orbital station it hurts a lot
the map also has some annoying functions  while in map mode i can select targets for focus and to adjust view but as soon as i leave that map view a return to the map view refocuses on the current ship  when trying to finetune intercepts this adds quite some time and needless zoomsclicks to see the periapsis  the inability to add maneuver nodes to future spheres of influence also frustrate mission planning  finally the inability to hide other vessels on the map frustrates being able to focus on a body being orbited by another craft
suggestions
1 add fuel transfer between tanks  please  its such a waste of timeeffort to have singleuse vessels
2 allow an option to retain focus between viewings of map mode  ideally making it similar to ksp1 would be great since it was easy to navigate between bodies and back to the ship
3 a choice either add an alarm clock like feature look at kerbal alarm clock mod from ksp1 or allow adding maneuver nodes outside the vessels current soi
4 add the filter from ksp1 to the map view  sometimes one wants to see other vessels on the map  sometimes one does not

at present having researched almost all of tier 1 and having unlocked tier 3 of the tech tree having made minidescenders for eve and a xenon probe for jool these are my issues and observations

#####

not ready for even early access

 worst performance i have ever seen 
 amount of bugs is insane
 50 dollars

#####

very playable and fun now after the for science update missing lots of quality of life features still but its finally good enough for early access

#####

i refunded at launch but gave it another spin when they released for science its a prettier base ksp 1 at this point but im ok with that as a starting point

#####

huge ksp1 fan 1800 hours on record  couldnt wait and purchased as soon as it went live this morning  this is way too unfinished for even early access  graphics issues buggy frame rate drops causing crashes in flight  sandbox mode only  no atmospheric resistance  just not ready at least not for the current price  refund requested  will pick it back up once they have it further along or if the price drops  cant wait for the day they get it sorted out and i can add it back to my library and change this review to a recommendation

#####

i invested over 1500 hours in ksp1 and after playing 8 hours on ksp2 i can comfortably say it is worth investing in if you were a fan of the original investing is the appropriate term by the way yes there is more to do in the original at present but if youre a fan whos in it for the long haul you might as well get it for a relative discount compared to full release pricing and play in the sandbox while they put together the full package

there are numerous bugs that remain in my last play session i had 13 xl landing legs pop off my moho lander midway through deployment the camera at launch initially points upside down till i toggle chase mode and struts went through srbs which makes separation tricky but the core mechanics and trialerror that i loved in ksp1 are very much intact besides bug fixesoptimizations the game very much needs a progression system to offer that sense of accomplishment from the original so i was glad to read that the development team is focusing more of their energy on longterm progression hopefully science mode will be on its way soon as i think it could be exactly what the game needs

to add to all this im running it on a belowminimum machine an optiplex 3060 mt with a gtx 1650 for a gpu the gpu is well below the minimum spec and though i have to commit all setting to low and occasionally switch my resolution to 720p to stay around 30fps it is definitely a playable experience if youre a dedicated fan ive also noticed improvements on bugs and performance over the last couple patches so im hopeful this will continue as patches carry on

overall the game is far from ideal in its present state but it is exactly what i expected from early access and if youre as obsessed as i am with ksp1 i think youll thoroughly enjoy playing around in the sequel just watch out for the kraken

#####

i wanted this game to be good so badly and maybe it will be but it is not ready for early access not even close will be happy to support the devs when the game is in a playable state but thatll have to wait obviously ill update my review when that day comes

#####

apart from getting 15fps the game is amazing yes it just launched yes it handles horribly yes its early access yes theres not much to do but all that aside its kerbal space program 2 amazing game oh and the load times are faster than me when nvm forget that took off landed on the same planet i took off from and well didnt do much else played tons of ksp 1 love it

my specs to achieve 15fps

gpu gtx 1080
cpu i99900k
ram 32gb 3200mhz
ssd 980 pro ssd
monitor 2560x1440p 165hz
in game resolution 1920x1080
in game settings set all to low
result 15fps

overall ksp 2 gets a yes from me

#####

for more than a decade i have been as ardent a supporter of the first kerbal space program as anyone out there  ill blab on about its wonder to everyone within earshot whether they care to hear it or not  ive almost alienated friends family and coworkers praising it as something everyone should try at some point in their lives making them sick of hearing about delta vs and orbital trajectories  so that in mind it pains me deeply to have to give kerbals highly anticipated sequel a bad review 

there are some very promising pieces that make me excited about a possible future in this game but after seven months time i have to concede that that future feels out of reach for this development team  even giving them the benefit of the doubt for an initial stumbling out of the gate and circumstances beyond their control my confidence has waned as their responses seem less understanding and apologetic and more aggressive and defensive  

i started kerbal 1 in the very early days of 013 alpha and while there were tons of bugs every time they added a new feature at least they were always adding something new or reworking old systems to make each release a little bit better  kerbal 2 so far has felt almost the opposite  there have been no new features added along the way and none of the worst offenders in the bug department have been caught and resolved 

ships will disassemble themselves without warning   struts will all become disconnected when loading a craft file forcing to you manually restrut your whole ship  the game itself will suddenly close and crash with no warning  crafts will become corrupted so completely that even reloading a save will not avert the bug from happening once it happens thats just a bug that ship has from now on  

all of this would be forgivable of course if there was any sense that actual progress was being made and that there was a conversation happening with the community at large  squad for all its inexperience in gaming was excellent at meeting the community on its level and explaining what  was happening  by contrast strike star theory strike intercept games seems to think that all complaints are entirely unjustified and that none of us know what were talking about  from this outsiders point of view it really looks like none of them know how to engage with the kerbal community with any level of understanding it  

ill still hold a candle for hoping this is just the growing pains of an early game dev studio working under a behemoth publisher and that in time there will be a kerbal space program 2 worthy of a positive review but that is not this day

well as a ksp fan like many others here i must admit that this is my main gaming disappointment of the year let me add some context here  game has huge uxui issues in my opinion and some changes are unnecessary at best and will be a huge deal breaker for new players as game is focused on them too

lets start with good stuff
 current gameplay loop  its still ksp all the main pillars are in place and thats great to see cant wait for new mechanics modes and end game content
 graphics looks amazing yes game is quite heavy but its worth it its a great groundwork for future improvements and optimization issues will be sorted out as usual but with this level of fidelity and new shader pipeline i cant imagine how good it will be with mods i hope at some point we will se rt support too new clouds are fantastic glad to see right people from the community were hired
 sounds and music this is the last thing ive expected to impress me but its light years away from ksp1 new sounds are crisp and nice but hearing motives from bsg while orbiting the mun  sound department nailed it on every level
 game was very stable no crashes so far thanks for that

and now everything else
 ui is the biggest problem for me so far completely understand that its one of the most distinctive changes to visually differ from original but its too much its very visually heavy and distracts form the beauty of the game i tested it on 3 different displays and its just a visual mess in any resolution whole visual appearance is just wrong and i cant see how this can be good in 5 years for example its outdated and hurts experience it needs a complete revamp imo make it cleaner and more streamlined any ui designer will say that it should not distract this much oh and so many misclicks
 ux sometimes feels irritating and clunky some menus are unresponsive and overcomplicated but dont provide even the half of flexibility from ksp1 whats the point of all this huge windows if i cant even lock fuel some things that were previously done in 1 click but now it can take from 3 to 5 camera in vab is also a problem and can do random things  it jumps unpredictably and is just less easy to use
 make game to pause when pressing esc most of the times it will be used for that if i will want to continue it in the background while going through settings  there can be a button for that its not an online game to justify that it should be paused by separate button and not by esc too can we have both
 new tutorials wont help with such ui its one step forward and two steps back for new players
 current lack of content and features but that was mentioned a lot previously
 bugs lots of them random glitches during launch wobbly rockets
 no proper mod support well community can do amazing things if you help them a little but youre already aware of that
 and overall  its just not fun for me as of now

im fully for the idea that ksp2 should be focused on new and emerging players but i cant imagine how this can work with such terrible uxui game trying to be friendly but visual appearance and usability just doesnt support that theres no need to change every aspect of the game especially if it makes things worse

to be honest im seeing selfidentification problem this game trying to be new in every way and bring something for core fans and new players at the same time but lacking to deliver both more than that  its frustrating in very basic things totally understand that developers are under huge pressure and doing their best but dont waste your resources on things that already work great and millions players got used to them changes for the sake of changes are not improvements and focus on one direction organic sentiment can do miracles

i specifically waited for it to be updated and its great to see the progress the launch version was not something i wanted to get but with just a fraction of the previous content and features i cant justify the current price model new additions just dont balance it out and new bad design decisions make it significantly worse for me i mean financial models can support starting at lower prices and then rising it with added value of the game but as of now its a very bad deal i know you guys developers playing long run here and have many obligations to your partners and the publisher

but ksp1 became financial success because it started small never overpromised and delivered gradually very little number of players complained about the price and it will be very hard to convince existing audience and convert them

for new players its a hard pass

huge kudos to graphics and sound design team  great achievement i hope developers will sort everything out and will redo certain things when they have resources wish you all the best and hope to change my mind in near future 

looking forward to play this game in upcoming years and convince my friends to get it

#####

in its current state id wait for a sale itll take that long to update the game to a usable state anyway
this is early access day 1 and the game is heavily unoptimized this wouldnt be a problem if the game wasnt already delayed for
three
years
you mean to tell me that this is the culmination of an extra 1000 days of development
buy it if you want to support private division but i really dont see a reason to play it for the next 6 months when the first patch will probably drop as the original a game thats over a decade old runs better than its sequel 
im not mad just disappointed
rant time
i also love watching these stockholm syndrome bootlickers worship the devs as they pay a aaa price to test  b not play test b a game thats worse than ksp1 in u every single way u despite getting an extra three whole years of development then defend themselves by saying its early access despite it again having been in unreleased alpha for at least the last three years
now the part that will make myself cry
i really dont want to say it i really want to cling to any hope i have left yet i cant i know a lot of you are going to hate me when i say this but it has to be said i need you guys to wake up because here it comes
h1 guys the updates are going to be just as bad as this release h1
whats really bad is not the game but what it represents and what its audience could have been b ksp has inspired an entire generation to advance their careers in the aviation and aerospace industry and i am among them as im a few months away from getting my cfi rating and working at a flight school for my hours for atp with the failure of ksp2 the future has been doomed the next generation will not look to the stars the human race will most likely remain shackled to this rapidly dying earth all because of the destruction of the only real inspiration for such an incredibly important action that our children will now never make this game was the beginning of humanitys ascension into the stars and with its failure so too fails the human race b

#####

ive got almost 2000 hours played on ksp1 and the new user interface is straight garbage i hate it building and manipulating craft in the vab is far too difficult compared to ksp1 and lacks consistency from building to launch also where the heck are all the parts that were available on ksp1 with add ons no station parts really with as long as it took yall to produce this game i expected a lot less bugginess and smoother gameplay and maybe more stock parts options with the base software for 50 and years of waiting this sucks ass if you havent bought yet save your money

edit as ive logged a few more hours on the software it has become more of a pain than its worth i dont understand how you can keep an extremely popular game in prerelease for an entire year claim to have fixed almost 2500 bugs and be proud about that im requesting a refund and ill be avoiding every release by these developers forever

edit 2 apparently if you paly more than 2 hours pn this game youre not eligible for a refund 
marx was right

#####

review has now changed from not recommended to recommended after the recent update this is how it should have released in ea 

now we just need a good mechjeb mod

#####

warning do not buy this in its current state

completely broken and unplayable in its current condition

i wasted 50 almost a year ago when this came out and still cant play this without several major gamebreaking bugs

ive uninstalled this mess and have gone back to ksp1 with mods

best to wait and see if they ever fix this game and deliver all the promised features before they completely pull the funding



#####

yes it is buggy this game is a longterm investment so if you want to wait till its more polished then by all means do that but for all intents and purposes this is an early access game with developers are wanting to please in other words if you want to help develop this game buy it if you want something you can play every day maybe wait a year or two

#####

if youre super sensitive to and turned off by major problems then maybe wait until end of year  stick with ksp1 or juno while waiting 

if you love the game and really want to support them then go ahead and buy this  instead of kickstarter upfront funding youre funding incrementally by buying the early access builds  if youre ok having to forcequit and restart sometimes and just want to tinker then this is great  the new developer has a kb article on how to submit bug reports

early access is not getting a beta game looking to iron out some wrinkles  this is paying their developers and serving as their qa department during alpha builds  remember that the pandemic stalled a lot of things including ksp2  original development split off renamed split again then the publisher created their own dev company to take over key resources and continue development all of those changes lost momentum resources etc  some of the early funding was wasted in these reorgs

a big part of the current funding model now is early access sales  they are developing this game still  feb 2023 was early access  midmonth patches every month so patch 3 should be coming out in just over a week  they are honest about the current state referring to the game as being version 01 patch 2  zero point one  the dev team is smaller than it was at the start but all of the core people needed to pull this off are there  its just going to take time or money or both

bobservations from playing 012 includeb
so far ksp2 doesnt support ultrawidescreen without editing config files  ksp2 has the same publisher and that publisher now has a third party launcher that seems to be only for mailing list signup  you can run the game without the launcher

it doesnt seem to represent maxq and the flight dynamics feel different though a lot less rubberwhip looking things too  navball graphics are hard to read and the whole instrument cluster is more fancy and less familiar  hotkeys are not displayed without going into settings or getting to the right place in the training  training is slowpaced and difficult to skim  its like kids cartoons probably fine for young kids but iffy for older kids or adults  no missions yet which is expected at this stage of development

the first 10 launches force you to wait for a kerbal to count down  some things even outside of the formal training are forcibly redisplayed without the ability to cancel other than to click continue on each popup  the popups cannot be moved to see whats under them

the game is still unstable  stages sometimes disappear or have pieces disappear  you have to save and exit out of the vab and go back  switching between buildings can hang at a splash screen  if you deviate in the training or continue ahead before it notices you did the thing already it gets stuck

the graphics are more pretty  better textures  the launch pad is an actual launch pad  etc

bpersonal summaryb
core interface issues still exist and at present  because of the condition it affected reviews  because of reviews its slowed prebuy funding  because of that lower funding its slowed development efforts  but it is still moving forward  i would call this a risky bet at this time but worthwhile if you love space  if it pays out it will be 100 worth the uncertainty  if not well theres always ksp1

instead of thumbs up or down i want a meh button  as is i dont recommend the game  but i recommend the dream of the game and i recommend helping fund that if you have the disposable income

#####

i dont have the performance issues that everyone else is having and my pc is 6 years old i can see that it is going in the right direction but right now it is not worth 50

#####

horribly uncomfortable ui
miserably unoptimized
unacceptable ea bugs aside

#####

i was an early adopter of ksp 1 i put so many hours into ithours not reflected by my steam count because i resisted moving it to the steam platform for years  i love the game

ive spent only a few hours playing ksp 2 so far its in far better shape than ksp 1 was when it first went on sale maybe that tempered my expectations because i wasnt expecting it to be as good or as gorgeous as it is i havent encountered any major issuesa few vab bugs with symmetry mostly but i am not completely surprised by that  struts let you change both endpoints now which leads to their own set of controlrelated issues but all of that is pretty minor

i was able to build ships to fly to the mun and minmus land and return the new maneuver node features work well the graphics for orbitals and soi changes are nice allinall im pretty pleased with the progress so far

that said this is an early access game dont buy it if you are expecting it to be in anything close to a finished state its not theres no game here yetno missions no cash etc and honestly it took years for that stuff to come to ksp1 right now its a pretty sandbox that lets you build and fly rockets into space and thats fine with me i can accept the state its in now and look forward to whats to come ive bought into early access games including ksp1 that were in much worse shape at the start 

all the internet hyperbole is just crazy calm down take a deep breath and decide if you want to fiddle with the unfinished game now or wait theres no need for all the outrage

#####

kerbal space program 2 downgrade

extremely disappointed in this release  it does not even have all the features of ksp1

there is no multiplayer  there is no interstellar travel  there are less parts than the original  there is no career mode  there are no missions  there is no science  the graphics are worse than the original  the ui is worse than the original  the performance is worse than the original and thats running the original on hardware that is 2 generations behind what i am running ksp2 on  

ksp2 is nothing more than an incomplete copy of ksp1  a shitty incomplete copy

i suspect they spent more time feeding that cow with the dyed hair thats in all the promo videos than actually programming a game

dont waste your money at least yet

#####

after 5 years ksp 2 truly succeeds at blowing my expectations out of the water with a 5700xt and a 5 part rocket i get a whole 15 fps groundbreaking technology and game development methods are at play to ensure that you get the best value for your 50 less content than its predecessor extremely subpar graphics and filled to the brim with promisedtobefixed bugs and glitches wow

#####

dont buy

there is nothing worth your time and money right now
check again after 3 years

launch ksp 1


#####

if youre coming from ksp1 and havent bought this yet id advise waiting since ksp1 is still a more complete game and theres really nothing in ksp2 yet that doesnt exist in ksp1 however if youre new to ksp and looking to start playing it ksp2 might now be the best way to do that

the for science update has dramatically improved the performance situation and is definitely better than ksp1s tech tree but i mean its still basically the same thing at least for now and the bugs are still there its not as good a game as ksp1 yet much better than it was but i still cant give it a recommended for now


#####

i cannot recommend this game in the current state if you want to enjoy ksp and you are not a current player i recommend buying ksp1 it is a true classic and absolutely rock solid and playable if you want early access in order to supply the developers with a continuous stream of bugs and oh boy you are going to be finding bugs and you have a pile of cash you want desperately to be rid of then by all means buy this early access version

#####

has potential to be even better than ksp 1 but even a year later its still not worth it performance is better but its full of bugs ksp 1 is just way better in every single way graphically speaking you can go way beyond what ksp 2 even offers and that is its only strong point

never played a ksp game before trying this one today  got lost in it playing for 6 hours  it was both hilarious and extremely frustrating

there are bugs that will not show your path at all leaving you to have to restart  if you have more than 3 engines on a build your fps goes to the teens even on my box with a 13900k 4090 and 32 gigs of ddr 7200  the longer your save file has been around the worse your fps gets and there are extremely visible and frustrating lag points when you attempt to build your rockets

the most frustrating aspect of this ea launch is just that  its an early access title that the studio has released as playable but not yet feature complete  unfortunately this also comes with a 50 pricetag on something that at this point in its development especially with none of the features the dev studio has promised to bring our way aside from sandbox mode becomes a pretty hard pill to swallow

i would personally pass on spending 50 on this as i dont think people will get the enjoyment out of the money theyve spent until a much later point in time when the devs actually implement some of the features and fix some of the glaringly obvious and very broken bugs that are prevalent throughout the current build

#####

extra launcher 
eula 


#####

i have hundreds of hours in ksp 1 on steam and probably hundreds more off steam ksp 2 does not seem to improve upon ksp 1 in any regard other than slightly better graphics i have 19 hours in ksp 2 and my opinion is that it is a bad game check out juno new origins its an okay game better than this

#####

asking 30 for this was ridiculous i was such a big fan of the original ksp that i actually went to college for and pursued a career in aerospace engineering this glorified tech demo is a mere fraction of what the original ksp was and has undergone almost no qa testing whatsoever stay far away from this for at least the next 2 years until it has at least half as many features as the original game slapping early access to a product isnt a get out of jail free card for low quality unfinished games and this shouldnt be tolerated

#####

it is what it is

for early access im kinda dissapointed for what has been served
i know that this game is clearly in the early access phase but the devs wanted to first publish this game 2 years ago and i dont know what made them think that they could do it in that time frame when the state of the game is basically unplayable or at least not enjoyable

many things are missing which is understandable but also dissapointing
the more precise maneuvering tool is not existent in this version of the game even though that feature has been in the first version of the game for years now also once creating a maneuver node and kinda working out the kinks of it it will  be very flaky just rolling my vessel changes the complete route of my orbit including many kraken attacks you also cant really see or read wher your orbit will pass relative to the planet destination in my case duna even with a intercept to duna i couldnt really know where id be passing and how far id be from the ground

theres also an issue with targeting things in general when trying to target a planet like duna from kerbin i always target or at least select its moon ike i have to weirdly move around the map and get close to duna to then eventually select and target duna

my first mission was to try a apollo style duna mission my part count easily went to 250 and my framerate was basically unbearable for the most time at the start i would have maybe 25 to 30 fps after going interplanetary id would go down to 15 and when entering dunas atmosphere id get maybe 5 to 10 if im lucky i was playing at low settings and also with a 3070ti almost the recomended spec to play

also kraken attacks mild and strong ones after landing on duna i noticed that the orbit of my mothership basically shifted so much that it would end up crashing into duna after solving this and going back to the lander it would jump up and spin 10 times even though it was safely landed on the ground

also the timewarp feature seems to lock even when located at the kerbal space center but that was because one of my vessels was at a constant altitude of 150 000 meters yet i could not go over time warp 10 000 and i guess the perfomance takes a general big hit since the entirety of the map now is loaded constantly since i can switch from vessel to tracking station to other vessel and back with ease its kinda a winlose situation

delta v calculation is completely off hook and the fairings spaz out completely when hovering over to see whats inside of them

the stage button space bar would sometimes stop working and would have to be pressed manually by mouse
docking port cant decouple like in ksp 1 decoupler needed inbetween

those are just some things which are currently wrong but in terms what i expected i am equally ecstatic and equally dissapointed

i hope the devs will move into the right direction using our reviews as feedback

all in all pretty game unplayable for now i will continue to play it just to give feedback but for those looking to actually play the game wait a few weeks up to some months after pre release or even a few months before the full 10 release

#####

that first patch is a godsend

#####

original thumbs down post below

ok as it stands with the for science update the game has improved enough to be a thumbs up for its early access tag 

but in saying so is it really worth the buy in price now

yes and no

for science has added a lot and its now enjoyable to play this mode but i feel the ea price tag is still to high to convince people to come play at its current position of development 

so if you have money to burn and you like rockets then sure ksp 2 is on the up and up but if money is tight for games i would wait off until a much deeper discount comes around

overall game has improved a lot which i can give it in its current form a thumbs up and will stay this way unless the devs drop the ball and go down a path like what they released at launch only time will tell



wow where to start

supported ksp series since nigh day 1 of ksp 1 with the quality of the previous game knowledge and prior skills from supporting ksp 1 you would think ksp 2 would be just a newer prettier and enhanced ksp 1 but nope its a train wreck on a train wreck

the positive personal opinion

the ui i myself quite like it though many do not
updated gfx though with some mods ksp 1 looks better still
not much else

the negative

the game being available to purchase with the store screen making it look like its already well into development when in truth its no where near it bare bones lucky to get a rocket to make orbit without wobbling its way there and the list goes on

the biggest issue for me is the communication from the developers i am gobsmacked at how bad the dev teams community engagement is everything the community doesnt want to hear and nothing they do want to hear makes the community very negative towards your product and it shows on ksp2s current rating mostly negative at time of writing this and to be honest its currently deserved

a big tip for the developers be honest about development no matter whats going on behind the doors your cms should be vocal in the community regardless if its good bad or ugly feedback take it all onboard and work to improve what is lacking keep the people updated on the game progress a few pics of the games development showing what is being worked on once a  week is a simple task to do but you all prefer to go into black out and shut down communication for weeks or months on end

ball is in your court intercept games and its match point against you so what do you do lift your game and get back into it or continue down the rabbit hole time will tell soon enough i suspect

finally at bintercept games i challenge you to show me you can turn this around and get this review changed to positiveb i do want ksp 2 to succeed and not become another lost to the void game in my list of steam games

#####

i have 800 hours in ksp1 and i can tell you ksp2 is not ready

the good
it looks great the tutorial was excellent  it certainly has potential

the bad
far too many bugs  disappointing lack of content  poor performance  in my mind this falls short of meeting the concept of a minimum viable product

most of the bugs ive come across completely ruin immersion and fun  it is definitely not worth a 50 price tag  i beat my head against a brick wall trying to squeeze out some fun from this game but it was just too frustrating an experience  i would rate this game as wait and see and hopefully it will get frequent regular updates such that i will want to try it again in a few months but for now i am moving on

#####

after many months of small updates the first big update was released   for science  the difference between the launch day and today is like night and day instead of 20fps on full hd resolution im getting 60 fps on 2k resolution and higher quality
the game is actually fun to play without your rocket exploding each time after timewarping
i would actually recommend this game now whilst still not perfect it is a huge improvement compared to the launch day disaster  its fun and enjoyable now hoping to see more updates like this in the future

#####

i dont think ive ever been more disappointed by anything in my entire life ksp is probably one of my favorite games in existence and since the launch date was announced i havent thought about anything else other than playing ksp2 but after playing for roughly 30 minutes i could not be more upset  the game has significantly overhauled graphics but none of that matters when it only runs at sub 20 frames i was more than happy to wait 3 years for the game to release and even when it was announced early access i was fine with only getting part of the game if it meant it will be improving but instead we waited all this time only to get the original game that runs worse as disappointed as i am i look forward to improvements in the future however this game should not be available for purchase

#####

i recommend this with a big caveat be very aware that you are at the time of writing this review buying into a very early version of the game it is unstable and missing features if you have any doubts at all do not buy it right now save your money until it has had time to update because again it is early access emphasis on the early

#####

this demo is abandoned close this page and go play ksp 1

#####

the price keeps climbing but dont get fomo  it wasnt worth the money when it was a fraction of the cost
too many bugs promised features and ridiculous developer updates
performance frames per second more like seconds per frame

i followed ksp1 from 2012 onwards and it showed promise throughout even with slow development but this game is aiming for the stars and keeps missing

i do not care if you have real audio from actual launches and insight into next generation tech  it honestly feels like our money is being wasted on sending your development team around america for holidays with some gopros

#####

the performance issues are bad optimization is lacking
i got around 2030fps max 60fps with rtx 3090  i9  64gb ram installed on m2 drive
game is also full of bugs water landing caused the vessel to keep falling towards center of kerbin etc
the new ui style will divide opinions

current price is way too high for what is offered in return

#####

strike kerbal space program 2fps ill change my review once the game is in a decent state but right now its like looking at an old friend who turned to drugs strike

edit 12192023 the first major content update was just released adding science and progression as far as i can tell most of the major bugs have been fixed excited to see where this game goes
