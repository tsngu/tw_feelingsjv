im 50 long time gamer and this is the best game ive ever played i remember years ago waking up with my sons to play zoo tycoon 1 and 2 and spending hours with them building amazing zoos now i can relive that feeling with lifelike graphics and even share creations with my sons who are now in their 20s what a game

#####

hayo  i bought this game 5 weeks ago ostensibly in hindsight as a reward game for my girls to play in the evenings  ummyeah  281 hrs later it turns out this has now become daddys game that they occasionally play and also love  

the graphics on this game hoh boy phenomenal for the animals ive spent 5 minutes just watching a lemur or red panda galavant around a habitat ive built for them before realizingwhoops theres a game going on in the background ill refrain from much commentary on the comical avatars of the zoo guests in contrast to the lifelike depictions of the stars of this game the animals beyond saying it somehow works  sound  good music that does not get too repetitive and very lifelike calls from the animals when you zoom in on them  animal behaviors are also incredibly realistic other than the flow on animals climbing things or walking through objects that occurs if youre watching them closeup

worth full price for the game and the dlc have not yet purchased the most recent aquatic pack  sandbox mode is the kind of thing you could literally sink 1012 hrs into before realizing that the entire day is gone  franchise mode is as challenging as you want to make it based on the difficulty slider for each individual zoo you choose to create global trading is a bit janky with other users charging exorbitant prices for infertile animals but you can also leverage that system in order to make a quick profit to get better animals too  game also comes equipped with useful tutorial scenarios the ones my girls are doing for what is ostensibly their game and a fullblown ingame career story arc that is also as challenging as you want it to be  great game  so glad i got it for my girls i mean

use to play zoo tycoon games with my dad when i was young he passed away a couple years ago playing this game reminds me so much of those times with him its everything me and him always wanted out of the game thank you to the creators of this wonderful game

planet zoo is probably the game that i was most interested in of the last 10 years which might seem a little weird but the premise of the game literally ticks all my boxes not only have i worked with exotic animals for my entire adult life which showing my age is quite a long time i have an avid interest in animal breeding genetics conservation and video games its a bit of a hard combo to meet all these interests so the original zoo tycoon series topped by zoo tycoon 2 is one of my favourite games of all time ignoring the hideous console reboot of course which i like to pretend doesnt exist  planet zoo released when i was wallowing pretty deeply in depression and havent had much time for video games so i havent quite managed to get the pleasure out of it id hoped for but thats certainly no fault of the game 100 hours later and ive finally mustered up a few words to start reviewing again and almost made a decent looking custom enclosure or two

 stunning graphics
 realistic animal behaviour
 complex breeding and genetics
 ample tycoon  management mechanics if you want them and a sandbox if you dont
 franchise mode which allows you to link multiple zoos and get a great feeling of progression
 62 million feels like customization options
 extensive workshop support and amazing fanbase of creators
 lots of conservation information and very educational
 regular updates and new content
 interesting campaign with some stunning prebuilt zoos
 one of the narrators is welsh

 perfect customization is a bit fiddly with a high learning curve expect to spend hours making a single wall at first if you dont want to use the workshop
 i expect the rising cost of buying all the dlc is going to start putting some people off who are new to the game
 the pathing system still makes me want to throw things at my computer
list

i think that planet zoo is everything that we could have hoped for in both a successor to zoo tycoon 2 from an animal simulation perspective and a successor to planet coaster from a tycoon perspective planet coaster initially lacked in tycoon elements and campaign features but feedback was definitely listened to and planet coaster has a much deeper array of management tools as well as a fully fleshed campaign complete with storyline and voiceover also one of the narrators is welsh and hearing a welsh accent unexpectedly when i first played the game brought a rare smile to my face

it gets a double thumbs up from me right back to encouraging animals to get it on

i would 100 suggest doing the career mode before you get into building your own zoo i bought this game jumped into the sandbox and had no idea what i was doing couldnt even build an enclosure that worked once i played the career mode it became so much easier and enjoyable 

the customisation you can achieve and the beautiful graphics make this an incredible game 

im not a very creative person but this game brought out the best of what i do have in the creativity stakes

this game has changed my life and im not exaggerating 

i am an autistic person and one of my biggest hyperfixations my whole life has been zoos i used to play minecraft mods with animals in them and make my own little zoos and i would play games like zoo tycoon for the xbox and religiously watch lego zoo speed builds a fond memory of when i was little was when me and my family would go to australia zoo its one of my favourite memories as a child now that im older i am a big fan of simulator and sandbox type games

this game is perfect for me because it brings me nostalgia from my childhood and it fits with my current interests at first it was hard to work out but the tutorial mode helped me tons the game is packed full of animals and it feels really realistic my favourite part of this game is the enclosure making i feel like i can express my creativity with how in depth the building is in the game it reminds of the sims 4 in a way as it is incredibly beautiful the animals are adorable and i love seeing them grow and taking care of them i also love the humans silly designs

the only negatives to the game is that you need a reasonable computer but it works on cheap ones and gaming laptops despite the small community in my country it is a beautiful and engaging game with consistent updates and a really full basegame with cheap dlc too which is nice as i only get steam money on my birthday xd i believe that if your a fan of simulator games this game is perfect for you it is fully customisable and with franchise mode not being incredibly challenging and having challenge game modes it should keep u occupied and even become a hobby of yours

#####

buckle up because im going to attempt a comprehensive review of planet zoo

i have the impression that you may be interested in buying this game because you like me played zoo tycoon 2 when you were a kid and this game seems to just have the same vibe however planet zoo both is and isnt a reskin of zoo tycoon 2 though to render an objective judgement is unfair the quality of these differences are up to you to decide and i will attempt to simply list them here

before you even consider buying this game you need to consider your system a lowend or subtle gaming laptop can probably run this game on low settings but you will encounter some massive fps drops in larger zoos with more objects i originally bought this game not long after release and the arctic dlc but never played it because my old computer simply could not handle it a newish gaming setup is probably necessary to get the full experience from this game

first and foremost this game is obviously a graphics and general behavior upgrade over zoo tycoon part of the aforementioned full experience is being able to see your animals in high detail behaving like they do in the wild the sounds are clear and crisp with realistic behaviors the developers did their research when creating these animals and putting them into the game with a reasonable variety if the animals alone are a selling point for you then by all means stop reading my review and buy the game however there is more to the game than the animals and buying solely for the animals then not using the rest of the game is really not going to get your moneys worth

the second topic that i would like to talk about and is perhaps the broadest is the different game modes like zoo tycoon the sandbox mode allows you to create the zoo of your dreams without concern for money furthermore you an also express your full creativity in sandbox mode making custom buildings or shells you cant design the interior of a staff room or keepers hut and habitats including domes unless you are inherently rather artistic you might be more baffled and estranged by these options and taking advantage of them requires watching a few youtube tutorials and just videos to see what other people do for the artistic or those who are at least confident in their abilities you will almost certainly enjoy the freedom given to you in building creation fun fact you can turn on money and conservation credits in the settings menu in sandbox mode franchise mode is where i have to my own surprise logged most of my hours the pressure to successfully operate one zoo and eventually many others is surprisingly fun and i actually enjoy using the animal market with other players there are some computergenerated animals on the market in franchise mode but they are usually not as good as those which other players put up for sale challenge mode is similar but is completely offline and thus the animal market is entirely dependent upon what gets generated for you if you want the thrill of running a zoo but dislike the animal market you will probably enjoy challenge mode since there is a sizable playerbase franchise mode is my goto with a thriving animal market the last mode is career mode which i am torn on you must play through at least the first three scenarios to really learn how to play this game and i recommend the fourth as well spoiler the fourth scenario has you build your own zoo from scratch so if youre not sure what to do i recommend playing some sandbox first spoiler however some of the scenarios can be a bit frustrating and admittedly i havent finished them all so dont take my word for it

third is the micromanagement some people hate the amount of micromanagement but i actually enjoy it it goes beyond simply making sure your animals are happy and healthy down to the condition of barriers and the zoo including staff work zones you learn more about this in an early career scenario different animals also have different costs of feeding which is something to keep in mind spoiler for example the gray seal while a highappealing animal is liable to eat you out of house and home i am lucky that it draws a lot of donations to offset the cost and produce a profit but i would not recommend it for a beginning franchise zoo the polar bear also eats an insane amount 10k from what i saw in a youtube video and elephants and other megafauna also eat a lot be wary of this when planning your zoos spoiler in this regard i am struggling to find words to describe just how much actually goes on in the game and can only be experienced through playing

fourth congratulations on reading this far some people have reported crashes and freezes i think most of these have been ironed out after launch and in 2021 i have not had issues with game crashes you may have noticed that this game has dlc you do not need to buy the dlc to enjoy the game to the fullest but if you like the animals go ahead and buy it to support the devs the dlc is also great for the more creative players providing a lot of new construction pieces to build your alreadyperfect buildings it is true that the pathing tool is quite finicky and can be a pain to learn how to use though with some practice youll get the hang of it mostly the guest is always right but really the guests can be plain stupid the viewing platform is excellent but if an animal isnt right close to them they think the view of said animal is fine at best guests can also get stuck on paths which creates a massive guest traffic jam eventually entrapping your staff so when things go south see if your staff is stuck youll need to move the guests onebyone to free them and also ensure your paths are wide enough

the bottom line is that planet zoo can be compared to the civilization series though one more turn becomes one more little thing needs to be done you probably wont run out of things to do you do need to sink in a fair amount of time to get your moneys worth from the game being the stingy individual that i am i would recommend buying this game when its on sale especially if youre on the fence if you think this game speaks to you like no other then go ahead and buy it now at full price it is an extremely fun and addictive game but there is a steep learning curve to using some of the tools youtube videos are almost mandatory if this is your first game from this genre otherwise you will run the risk of becoming frustrated however if running a zoo doesnt appeal to you especially taking care of animals and dealing with guests who are sometimes quite dumb planet zoo may not be for you 910 would recommend to anyone who is interested

here is another game that my son and i spend together happily building zoos we laugh we joke about the animal enclosures in short we have a good time my son and i have expanded our games we play together to this game and i cannot be happier before we played video games we werent spending a lot of time together desperate i bought subnautica that helped and now this game has helped further i am a very happy mother spending time with her oldest son

#####

i never usually do any reviews as i a very unwell lady and suffer with so much pain but i wanted to share my experience with this absolutely amazing game it is so lifelike and it makes me smile especially when you are literally right behind a zebra and he or she decides to go to the toilet right up close this game is amazing and it takes me out of real life for a while and into a beautiful world and have you see the sun rise and sunsetwow i am so pleased with all the animals in the game too and i hope that there will be more added very soon there is just one teeny tiny problem thoughthis game is not easy to put down anyway well done for making this amazing gameoh and one more thing i was wondering if there is a plan to put the option of taking the unlimited money off its just more fun when you have money to spend lol anyway hope this review helps stay safe and take caremamfy xx

#####

i cant sleep at night this game ruined my life i close my eyes and all i see is planet zoo

#####

i love this game however my laptop does not

#####

theres a fine line between enjoying cute animals and wanting to punch your screen because your paths wont connect and that line is called planet zoo

#####

b overall rating 8510 b
tldr at the end

okay theres a lot to go over for this game 
if you are the type of person who seriously enjoys simulation games that you think youll only play for an hour or so and end up staying awake until 4 am this is one of those games from its endless amount of creative freedom to its beautiful graphics planet zoo has become one of my top favorite games 
i was an avid player of zoo tycoon 2 many years ago  had all of the expansion packs and spent hours upon hours managing my little animals and their little zoo when i jumped into planet zoo i was expecting a similar game to put things short planet zoo is its own ball game

in planet zoo you really get immersed in the whole zoo management system theres so much that you have to keep in check while designing your zoo but its not so much to the point it becomes overwhelming one moment youll be making sure your animals have the correct environment in their enclosure next youll be making sure your staff have the correct balance of jobs work zones saved my life on that one the neverending amount of creative freedom in this game provides endless opportunities for whatever your heart desires if youre the type of person who doesnt like spending hours handdesigning shops enclosures etc the steam workshop is filled with thousands of custommade exhibits decorations anything you could dream of on the other hand if you are the type of person who likes to design things specifically how you like them planet zoo offers endless chances to design whatever you want however you want to an extent 

now the only reason i wouldnt give this game a 1010 rating is due to some of the very poor development choices probably the most infuriating one that youll see mentioned in plenty of other reviews is the path system god does the system need to be redone its extremely finicky at some times and you are guaranteed to end up with little gaps in your walkways while designing your zoo the only way to combat these is either using the grid system for your paths or filling the small gaps with decorations but otherwise you just have to suffer through it another major development issue is that zookeepers will quite literally let some animals starve to death if your animals have certain enrichment items in their enclosures the keepers register that as being food and will avoid feeding the animals if youre seriously concerned about game bugs id recommend reading multiple indepth reviews as some explain them better than i can imo the game is most enjoyable in sandbox mode since the majority of bugs can be worked around through the creative settings

if youre seriously considering buying planet zoo please put in the patience and wait for a sale yes the game is extremely enjoyable but with what the cons and expansion packs entail i wouldnt rush to buy the game at full price

tldr planet zoo is a stunning simulation game that lets your creativity run wild hype aside it has some extremely frustrating bugs and game mechanics recommend waiting for a sale to buy

#####

its a fun game but its like the sims where buying all of the dlcs makes you go bankrupt

#####

build a zoo feel unsatisfied make a new zoo repeat

h1the planet is your zooh1

update 120219 big patch was released that fixed the crashes perfect thanks

bplanet zoo is a genre busterb i enjoy mostly strat games so thats usually the angle through which i view most of the games i play that said many of my favorite games split genres it is a citybuilders dream it is a simulation game to the core i am unsure where to split hairs between citybuilders and sandbox building games but they are two different things planet zoo can be described as both to some extent because of all these great angles from which to play and an awesome set of core mechanics planet zoo becomes this frankenstein monster of a game that just will not let go of you 

i enjoy city skylines immensely but i was not happy with the puny roller coaster and plopable set pieces i would have liked to construct the tracks like with the trains and the metro etc then there was jurassic world though it is a good game and i like the dinos it lacks in the complexity of a game like city skylines if you played planet coaster any at all then you only get part of the picture of planet zoo it goes much further planet zoo is a deep simulation city zoo builder that runs in pauseable realtime much like plague inc but all this does not tell you what planet zoo is like it is just for comparison contrast 

bmechanicsb
the game builds a set of about 76 species of beasts and insects of all kinds around a set of maps for each continent and biome the devs did a great job of covering a variety of each larger family of animal like antelope for instance the player gets a big picture of how animal life changes for similar creatures living in different climates within the framework of maps and animals i enjoy the following positives about the game mechanics 

	selecting animals for breeding based on a set of 4 genetic traits
	trading in the market for the breeders you want from other players in franchise mode
	sorting out offspring not needed for further breeding to sell or release into the wild
	creating a godlike creature ok so the genetics are fun you get the point
	using the zoopedia of info to determine what each animal needs to make it comfortable in the zoo enough for them to breed more babies
	building a zoo and all the many details that make them fun places to visit
	watching all the adorable animals
	watching the ai guests act like animal lovers this is so real 
	all the little things like the protesters who show up like idiots if you mistreat the animals they love
	conducting the research to open up more alternatives to build better enclosures and prevent escapes 
	seeing inside the buildings i love that for example look inside the hospital building to see your sick animals with the vet
	watching the animals fight over dominance mating and space issues
	i think they can die if you screw up enough ive never seen this happen but they have gotten near death a couple times 
	hiring scheduling and firing employees 
	routing traffic and roads
	the game is filled with data facts and science info about wildlife that can be selected for exhibition boards to educate your guests 
	this is not a game to play on fast speed and watch it run if you arent paying close attention bad things happen like your enclosure walls will collapse because those idiot mechanics are too slow getting around to repairing the walls then you know who to fire it is a deep management sim and there is a good balance between managing the ai instead of micromanaging the work yourself 
	the music is beautiful and is a big sign to me of how special this game is to the development teams when devs put a lot of effort into choosing the best soundtrack it reveals the game as a work of heart i appreciate that 

bconsb
there are some negatives to consider as well but i would rather play a slightly unoptimized game that captivates me for a ridiculous number of hours than a perfectly average aaa game any day of the week 

 the most fun is in franchise mode which is online dropped network connections can result in loss of connection to the servers 
the career mode is a set of scenarios they make an excellent tutorial but if youre like many gamers you dont really want to start there and only go there to pick up the achievies after figuring everything out on your own anyways the difficulty level seems a bit in need of balancing the first 3 are incredibly easy if youve already been playing in other modes then the 4th one throws you out there to design your own zoo from scratch expecting you to have about ten different species  another 6 or so small exhibit insects not too bad if you have already been exploring like me but expect mountainous taiga snow and very little usable space and they turn off the terraforming tools for good measure also they limit the choice of available animals in the market to 12 so you really have little choices there thats why i like the franchise mode so much choices 
 sometimes it seems things just wont cooperate for example in a tutorial career mode i had finished all the requirements for gold in about an hour except placing a single gift shop it just wouldnt let me place it the pop up kept saying wrong orientation finally it allowed me to place it in backwards and i got the completion moments later it notified me the shop was backwards and allowed me to turn it around 
 another example sometimes the terraforming tools seem to refuse to dig in spots but the tools are pretty freaking awesome the mechanics are easy to learn and you can sculpt the earth into whatever shape you want 
 the game was crashing when first loading into the game at first then the crash notification send button was stretched beyond all vision so you couldnt hit the send button and then it would vanish but the game would still be running in the background i switched the game from the widescreen 5760x1080 resolution i use for triple monitors to playing it in windowed on the center screen only that didnt seem to help the crash log was what was hanging the game up so basically just doing a control alt delete and stopping the crash log process in the task manager because the game wouldnt be there would make the game stop immediately then relaunching would work fine  but the last update seemed to solve this problem so far 

bsuggestionsb 
i can already see a few places where patches or dlc could add more to the game 
	it would be nice to see more visible variations in the animals based on genetics
	more animals yes there are many but more is always a good thing and i only say this because i know they will give us more animals it just makes good sense
	even more terraforming tools its kind of a limited toolbox atm
	some of the awesome tables and data sets like the market need quality of life optimization so that you dont have to input search parameters over and over every single search for example the sound effects here are very pleasing by the way
there are more ive thought of but cant remember atm i may add them later i listed the nitpicky bugs to help the dev teams the crash report didnt seem to be doing its job like a few ai mechanics

btldr conclusionb 
i highly recommend planet zoo for gamers of all ages it is enjoyable and captivating and filled with fun science stuff about animals of all kinds it is workshop enabled and integrates you into the community of zoo builders with many unique features like allowing friends avatars to visit your zoo and buying and selling animals from other players at time of writing this i have about 102 hours in the game i wanted to experience everything before reviewing it but it became obvious that this is not a game that will end anytime soon it has a lot of replayability the planet is your zoo go ahead and build it

i like to call my zoo drunk land because most of it was made without any level of thought or planning and will probably have major consequences for everyone involved 

the layout of my zoo is terrible and confusing but that probably doesnt matter because the customers are too busy complaining that they can see a generator and its ruining their day i dunno how they can see it when theres a giant pile of rocks in front of it but i guess my guests have the power to see through rocks as long as theyre not in exhibits also apparently free tickets are a problem which is very realistic because i know if i went somewhere and they offered me something for free what i would do is complain that free is too cheap and be concerned for the profits of a business i definitely wouldnt be happy to get free stuff also i cant make paths for crap so all the staff paths magically float above the zoo i like to call those the danger paths its a unique feature of my zoo where if an employee trips customers will get to watch him fall to his death

i hope to one day learn this game properly but for now i will enjoy the trainwreck that is drunk land and its infinite money that allows me to make all the mistakes i want and the only people that suffer are the employees the customers and the animals so everyone except me but i am the great zoo god so their feelings are irrelevant

this is highly dependable on what you are trying to do in this game if you are looking for a game that offers you a tool to build the most beautiful zoo possible this game is a gem once you get the hang of the building system in the game it is very easy to let your creativity go wild the management aspect can be tedious especially during the campaign when you try to achieve certain objectives in sandbox mode all management game mechanics can be turned of to make the game more relaxed which allows you to focus on building your ultimate zoo

planet zoo is a game that offers you an extreme freedom in building the zoo of your dreams management can be annoying and sometimes even frustrating however these annoyances can all be turned off in sandbox mode if you are looking for a game that gives you strategic challenges in running your own business this game is probably not yet for you however if you are in it for the building aspect and admiring your animals in your perfectly build zoo this is the almost perfect game

i really dont want to give this game a thumbs down its more like a neutral  review if you like planet coaster or zoos you will probably like this game too a dream for patient builders but with many technical issues its very fun but feels like a beta it has a lot of bugs performance issues and a fast game speed so should you buy it

finally ive waited too long for this game zoo tycoon was one of my first pc games its very nostalgic for me ive played it  for hours its awesome to see a proper modern zoo game though im still a bit disappointed

pros
1 good graphics realistic animal animations great rain and snow effects
2 very relaxing and immersive zoo experience you really feel like youre in a zoo
3 more than 50 detailed lovely cute and different animals very fun to watch
4 lovely details 7 different biomes climate does matter a lot place to build
5 a dream for builders creative and free ways to build blueprints workshop
6 4 different game modes career sandbox franchise and challenge mode
7 a very very good sound the music and animal sounds are incredible
8 you can learn more about the animals if you want to real life and ingame

neutral
1 the management is better than in planet coaster but still not that greatimportant
2 you can visit other zoos but it would be much better if there would be more features
3 the career is ok  but nothing special its like a tutorial but its not a good one

cons
1 horrible performance its not as worse as in planet coaster but still disappointing
2 many many bugs i luckily didnt have any long term game breaking bugs yet please fix
3 the game is too fast 3 seconds are 1 day make it customizable
4 the controls are badcomplex
5 no petting zoo underwater animals birds etc a bunch of popular animals are missing
6 im like 100 sure that there will be many many expensive dlcs
7 no mod support

conclusion
well i already said what i like and what i dont like its a very fun relaxing and realistic game you really feel immersed but sadly the game feels like a beta it has a lot of bugs and a poor performance im pretty sure that i will play this game for a very long time its a dream for patient people who love to decorate and build they should have delayed the release but i hope that they will fix the performance and bugs in future

should you buy it well if you are a zoo or planet coaster fan and like building and decorating you should consider buying it but you should keep in mind that it still has a lot of bugs game breaking too a bad performance and a few other negative points if you dont care about them buy it if you should you should wait for a few patches orand a sale or just skip the game

i will try to update this review after an upcoming big dlcpatch

still questions feel free to write a comment or send me a message

thanks for reading and happy gaming

#####

i grew up playing zoo tycoon and this game allows me to relive that gameplay experience while also keeping itself unique new and relevant

#####

after more than a thousand hours of play i think its time to write a review
i will keep the review short

who is planet zoo for

planet zoo is aimed at players who want to build their own zoo and do a little management
planet zoo is not for fans of management games the developer has put his focus on other game content
the game places a particularly high value on the creativity of the player because there are actually no limits to creativity
building may not be so easy at the beginning but there are countless helpful youtube videos with tutorials

there is also an interesting campaign a story mode that introduces you to the game which explains a lot but not everything youtube helps here too

what awaits you 

first of all many animal species from all over the world in the game there are animals that live in enclosures and animals and insects that live in vivariums
there are different biomes like the desert the tropics the taiga the tundra and temperate land like in europe or north america
the graphics look fantastic but are very hardware hungry a good cpu is especially important the graphics card is secondary

your creativity is needed 

it starts with the paths how wide should they be how should they look like
the buildings you need do i use prefabricated building plans or do i create some myself there are lots of materials in the game to build them yourself walls boards decoration etc but planet zoo has a problem with proportions there are simply too few small or short components  you always have to improvise 
if you dont want to build it yourself the steam workshop will help you  there are countless building plans but if you want to build your own you dont need the workshop but you can get some very good ideas here

the management system

the management system is kept really simple

once you get the hang of it you wont go broke
the main focus is then on allocating the staff which is not absolutely necessary it is important to provide food and drink because visitors are always thirsty and hungry and of course they want clean toilets the shops should be placed in such a way that the visitors visit every corner of the zoo shops often attract visitors more than animals it may also be important to start with less interesting animals in the entrance area of the zoo and to place the great animals further back as your zoo grows
and of course you should place the staff buildings appropriately but this sounds more complicated than it is

conclusion

if you like animals this is a good choice
if you like building you should get it
those who love management games should look around for something else

i love building my own zoo without steam workshop items thats why i have such a long playtime 
it can often take several hours or days to build a good building or enclosure

whether you really need the dlc is up to you but i think they are indispensable for every creative player
i think the dlcs where only animals are present are only interesting for animal lovers and not for creative players

#####

loveeee this game but please make like a ocean expansion with sharks fish for exhibits and jellyfish and dolphins and ect pleaseee

#####

literally half of my playtime is spent just watching the animals run around and interact with their environment

#####

as someone who grew up with the original zoo tycoon and zoo tycoon 2 i was kind of losing hope for a spiritual successor of the franchise being given the crap fest that is the new zoo tycoon i have also always been a fan of roller coaster tycoon games so naturally i played planet coaster as well which gave me high expectations for planet zoo and for the most part those expectations have actually been met the animals have unique needs and theyre nice to look at building exhibits is easier and more fun than in zt and zt2 construction is just like planet coasters it gives you a lot of room for creativity the campaign is good too and teaches features incrementally at an easy pace and im looking forward to more scenarios franchise mode seems laggy somethings though such as when opening the animal trading it can also be a little frustrating to filter and navigate on the trading i would like if there was a search bar and a clear all filters button at least theyve been pretty good so far with the patches that have been released so hopefully improvements will keep being made also i do miss having something like dinosaurs and marine animals but i guess pz is supposed to be more realistic

#####

good game animals good mechanics good buildings good i have spent a total of 45 full days playing this game so far i do not recommend this but i do recommend the game

#####

welp after a few hundred hours its time for me to finally give this game a review
im gonna preface this that this game is one of my favorite games and my favorite creative game for multiple reasons
ofcourse i like animals i am a zoo nerd but i want to talk about none of that

this game is imo arguably the best building game on the market if you like animals or not and just the amount of freedom and pieces you get in the game is astonishing completly breaking any caps making your creativity your limit
im somewhat competent of a builder by now aswell but if you want to see how much you can push the limits of the game go to the frontier forums and search for sallands adventure zoo from the youtuber ps vision gaming the zoo part in the name is imaginary instead of building a zoo this guy built a whole modern town set in the neatherlands so if the fact that its a zoo game kept you from buying it eventhough lets be honest if that was the case why would you even read this this game still is a fantastic choice to just build whatever your heart desires

but talking about honestly this games main point of critic ive seen is the large amount of dlc which is a fair critice to make but none of them really sat right with me most people say its bad because content is locked behind them which is simply not true no major content in itself is locked behind a dlc and the main game is completly sufficent in giving you a great experience but where the dlc really come in is to spice up the game and expand where the base game is lacking
for my own quick suggestions do not get any dlc at the start unless you allready know enough about the game that you know you will enjoy it when you play the game learn the ropes which can allready take a litte as the building has quite the steep learning curve as anything about aesthetic has and for that time the base game and its 75 species and 6 distinct building themes are more then enough 
once you got a bit more into it and enjoy the game thats when i would buy dlcs one at the time regarding whatever your preferences are wanna built an australian area cool get the australia pack south america south america pack and so on and so for there are 3 packs id recommend outside of this pattern those being the europe the wetlands and the grasslands pack
the grass and wetlands pack offer a good array of only animals each giving 7 normal animals and 1 terarrium animal for the wetlands and 5 different butterflys for the grassland pack these packs combine fill the base games most lacking areas increasing the amount of of south american habitat animals from 2 to 6 the australian from 1 to 4 with arguably the 2 most important ones in the emu and wallaby add 2 more birds to go from 3 to 5 and filling out the list of asian animals which mostly are very big in the base game with some smaller creatures including a cute otter with these 2 packs you not only increase the amount of animals from 75 to 95 the most possible with any combination of 2 packs it also expands most lacking areas to a degree that they become passable even without their specific dlc
the europe pack is here for another reason as its by far the most important pack for building none zoo things as it features 250 new pieces the most out of any dlc focused on different european architecture giving a great boon to building beautiful european styled buildings and while this pack is not neccessary for that it does expand the options by quite alot and makes it much easier

besides the dlcs the game also has offerd a free update that came with each of them featuring many new mechanics and just new things sometimes larger and smaller making sure to give everybody something whenever a new dlc rolls around if they buy it or not each update has a few new free plants bug fixes and many other new things with the last update for example featuring 12 new plants 4 new music tracks an ingame video editor to make tours of your zoos a camera mode the ability to customise staff members uniform adding a new behaviour to one base game and 2 dlc animals to make them more unique and overhauling a base game animals looks by adding multiple new colormorphs and mutations for it
and this was arguably one of the lighter updates as the 2 anniversary updates for example both have added a new animal to the game for free the black and white ruffed lemure and the red deer

so all in all if you like building games animals or zoos this is the game for you the animals are beautiful the building fantastic and the options allmost limitless only being limited by your creativity dont be scared of the dlcs you wont need them and can buy them if at all over time when you need them and still have a more then enjoyable experiance that regulary gets updated with a few new toys


#####

my review of this game is a little hot and cold if you are looking for an incredibly detailed and involved zoo sim then this is the game for you 
i really wanted to love this game but honestly dont play it very often i was looking for something zoo tycoon 2esque but this game is next level in terms of how complicated and involved it is there are so many things to keep track of and manage while playing i am usually a person who loves being able to deep dive but i find this game to be a bit overwhelming and not as relaxing or easy to fall into as i would like 
i find some of the things you have to worry about like keeping staff buildings totally out of sight of guests to be fussy and i wish there was a way to choose to have the game be less complicated 
there also isnt really a tutorial and the controls are fairly complicated to get used to this is further compounded when you stop playing for awhile and then want to start back up  i feel like i am a total noob having to learn all over on top of that there are some glitches that are incredibly frustrating i also wish the base game came with more animalscontent 

i think if you are looking for a very involved zoo sim then this game is perfect for you but if you are like me and were looking for something more along the lines of zoo tycoon 2 from your childhood this game is far more involved than that and i wouldnt recommend it

#####

predatory dlc tactics  the bundle discounts are impossible to buy if you already have the base game in your library which is an insult to people who purchased the game early  publishers should use the complete your collection feature of steam so that people who supported the game when it was released can still benefit from the discount

#####

this is my game of the decade yes that is right decade i have now done 1336 hours in just over a year a year and 2 months anyway great design the campaign is great way to learn but where this game really excels is the workshop download someone a blueprint and make it better make it yours gain ideas be inspired 

the game has received some good free updates including vending machines etc and education talks and each paid dlc adds a few more animals and ranging between 200 and 350 new items some people think 4 to 5 animals is not significant even and i do feel it is a bit on the low side however where these packs excel is the new items seriously in 1 year the community has received 1000 new items  and i am not going to lie some of these items i can not live with out for example the new waterfalls in the aquatic pack are a must

but back to the base game fun and educational how many games can claim that its not just about putting carnivores separate to herbivores  its about making sure your animals dont inbreed or spread disease and most importantly happy happy animals means more money from guests 

this is a very rich deep game i remember being on hour 1000 and i learnt a new mechanic that was how to lay perfect railwaytram tracks previously mine were wonky and looked hideous now after mastering this skill my zoo looks perfect

the game is not easy by any means and might not be accessible to really young kids but adults and younger adults should give this the time it truly deserves

this is a must if you ever played warzone you see warzone mentally scars you while planet zoo actively heals your soul it heals you with its endless positive vibes happy music and cute animals baby hippos being my favourite rn

#####

to start i am not a great writer and writing a review for this game is daunting as i have so many thoughts on it good and bad 

you will probably notice that the list of negatives is a lot longer than my positives and while that is true its also not entirely indicative of my overall feelings on the game because at the end of the day i am recommending it and it is one of my favorite games of all time i just want anyone considering buying it to be fully informed on what theyre getting into

this game has gotten me not just more interested in zoology but architecture and cityzoo planning as a whole and ive learned a lot from it and its awesome community if building a zoological facility is an interesting idea to you i wholeheartedly recommend it as you will not find any other game as in depth and graphically up to date

it is especially nice to see how tasteful it is with its approach to zoos as a whole with its big emphasis on conservation education and welfare the zoopedia entries get very indepth and are up to date with current care standards i dont get the feeling that im simply making a theme park with animals in it  it is entirely focused on the animals which might be boring for some people but in my eyes is a huge positive

and with all that out of the way my list of pros and cons

h1the goodh1

 the game looks great with some decoration skills you can make some beautiful scenery and buildings that look close to real life

 the animal models especially as of late are incredible the amount of detail and love that goes into them all the way down to their walk cycles and behaviors are well researched and beautiful

 optimization is pretty good for the majority of players i have an underwhelming laptop that still manages to run it pretty well even with lots of pieces onscreen albeit at lower graphics settings

 the group function is powerful and convenient once you figure out how to use it the game would not function without it and im glad its there

 the dev team is active and fairly responsive to criticism going as far as to remodel animals that were inaccurate binturong they seem to care deeply about animals and conservation if you guys read this youve done a great job

 while i mostly play planet zoo for sandbox building the actual gameplay is engaging and i enjoy most of the campaign levels 

 i have seen a lot of people struggle with staff properly maintaining animal care but as ive gotten used to how the game works i have not had much issue with it 
maybe its been tweaked since then but if you still have these issues i would suggest making sure to train your staff so they work more efficiently this seems to be more effective than hiring more staff much of the time



h1the not so goodh1

 the dlc if there is one thing that steers people away from planet zoo it would be this im a sucker for zoology and happily buy new dlc as it releases as im excited to build for new animals but not everyone is me and the amount of animals and building pieces locked behind a paywall has gotten absurd especially when iconic animals such as polar bears and penguins are not base game

 the learning curve is extremely steep i have hundreds of hours invested into it and only recently have found myself confident in my ability to build anything the group tool is a potentially powerful tool that i feel could have been explained more without a google search

 tutorial and campaign levels can and will break the tutorial levels seem especially bad about this and these are obviously the worst ones to have this issue and initially discouraged me from playing i have seen bug fixes released but continue to see people complain about them which is concerning

 many core mechanics are hostile to realistic zoo design if you want something that truly mimics real zoos you will have to do it in sandbox where it doesnt matter that all your animals are starving and dehydrated because your staff cant reach them

 related to the last point animal space requirements can be odd and seem more based around catering to their janky hitboxes that ruin traversability leaning towards more space than less is obviously great in terms of welfare but many of the very small animals look strange or nearly invisible in these wide open spaces

 if you are aiming for realistic zoo design you will find yourself repeatedly hitting a wall in performance 

because ingame mechanics do not mesh well with this type of design you end up having to sort of fake it till you make it using hundreds or thousands of small pieces to cover things up or build structures that should probably already be props sun shades on the workshop made from thousands of decals when they could easily just implement 1 piece props given how common these are in zoos

you can see why this will eventually lead to your framerates tanking ive had some saves repeatedly crash just from panning the camera around too quickly and overwhelming it from the sheer amount of objects it needs to render

 while most of the animals look excellent there seems to have been a shift in art direction over time leading to some of the original animals appearing strangely stylized and unrealistic the lion being the biggest offender the modding community is excellent and has great remasters though

 the dreaded pathing i am putting this at the bottom since i have more or less learned how to tame it or at least accept my fate when it doesnt work how i want it to its a pain its finicky it often makes zero sense why it works the way it does my biggest tip to anyone struggling with it is to smooth your terrain before placing it but even that does not always satisfy it



and thats it hopefully this is helpful to anyone on the fence about buying it especially with all the dlc i say give base game a try and see if the mechanics mesh well with you before buying anything else and if youre just looking for a management game to skip out on dlc entirely as they mostly targeted towards complex building and people that care about having specific species

and if frontier is reading this for some reason please do more base game patches and additions its getting pretty ridiculous at this point

#####

game is amazing was very excited about it on day of trailer and purchased day one of release it fills a niche market which i never knew i needed  

spent way to many hours in game 
amount of animals 
management tools 
customisable tools 
realistic animals 
time goes to fast in game update now has been fixed 
bugs and crashing  although we have already got three patchs since release which is great to know devs are listening 

#####

this is a sort of game ive wanted for literally my entire life my only complaint not enough reptiles give me more snakes please give me ball pythons give me indigos heck give me corn snakes you have a platform here to show people the beauty and wonder of all these different creatures let me have enough snakes to fill an entire zoo with them

#####

i love it 

i sit at my pc like ok i just need to check one enclosure and sell some of these god damn peacocks that breed like crazy then i look
up what my bears are doing and if they finaly matethen i gotta build some more stores  now i need some more workers caus there is too much trash  wtf are those scorpions  they went from 2 to 18 in no time holy moly lets sell some gotte put some more trees and rocks at my bisons enclosure they deserve it 

all that after i told my wife im gonna help her with the houshold in 10 minutes i played for 3 more hours thats why i write this review from my phone  on the couch where i gonna sleep tonight pray for me guys

#####

definitely recommend  be warned the game can be very frustrating with a steep learning curve and loads of mechanics to learn  however the career pathtutorial takes you through it bit by bit and eventually  with a bit of googling  it all starts to gel and its an absolute customizers dream  best quarantine money ive spent with endless replayability  by the way did you know a group of tapir are known as a candle  a candle  

#####

 first of all the main question should you buy this game yes this is a very good game filled with hours of content and every zoo is different it never really comes out just the same this is a true evolution of the management sim genre if you came here looking for the real zoo tycoon after being jaded by the mobilized version of the same name youre in the right place this game has the feeling of those old tycoon games while leaning heavily on the things that made those games great the customization really more than just a management sim this game has three gameplay loops and i will rate them all seperately 

first this game is a building game not so much in the sense that you can build but ingrained in the dna of the gameplay is a building loop i place a shop or staff house i build a building around that shop or house to make it look real i decorate that building i place the scenery around it this would seem repetitive but this is actually the real strength of planet zoo finding new and interesting ways to build things even better is the ability to copy those blueprints and use them in other builds i have the salty lion restaurant and as a chain within my franchise i can place it in other zoo builds and then simply blend it in to the surroundings this allows so that building never feels like a chore you think hey if i put the time into this now i can always pull it out and save time later for years sim games have just erased your progress and started you from square one and i appreciate the carryover because it allows me to focus on things that are fun and not tedious and makes me feel as though i am adding to the game 

that brings us to loop 2 the management sim loop in this loop planet zoo is i think the weakest its far to easy to achieve monetary success in this game i like the addition of conservation points in franchise as that adds another layer to the economy and im happy that they didnt go the way of most games and make them buyable and edge the mechanics to create artificial difficulty however starting with warthogs ostrich and pangolin i added in lions bats western diamondback red knee tarantula and gold python and im sitting at a cool 400k  and around 30k profit a year granted i am dystopian in the amount of monetization i enforce always riding the line of all out revolt but i wish there were more hurdles random events something to break up this loop a little more or call attention to it at all honestly in a way however how simple this mechanic is does give you the downtime to mess around with the animals and causes less panic that you feel in other sim games like tropico where it never feels like you have time to do everything it creates a more laid back experience and i find myself actually reading about the animals and learning new things so that might not be a bad thing if thats the devs intention 

third and final gameplay loop is a breeder i was more than a little excited about this aspect as i had been looking for a competent but new breeding sim for a long time its somewhat simplified not as complex as i would have liked i think the jurassic games have a more diverse and in depth system i would have liked to see that at play here when you get a good litter of cats its a nice feeling i like that they added the obstacle of inbreeding it adds a bit of depth also the alpha system is great i love that they have herds and am excited to go in sandbox and build an ecosystem all in all though the lifespans are too short and what at first is majestic over time becomes something of a farming resource because you dont have a lot of time to spend with them that makes me sad because the animals are beautiful well rendered i swear they have their own personalities my lion cub twins were dive bombing their mom over and over it was the best thing that happened to me this week but in that time of that animation 3 months had passed and we dont get a lot of those moments with one animal before theyre gone on some species besides the noble ostrich i have a 41 year old white ostrich named mandala hes basically the king of all ostriches 

so as unimportant as i am i give the game a 55 it was everything i wanted it to be and more which is something i cant say about a lot of game purchases i have made is it perfect no are there elements i wish were tweaked a little more to my liking sure but if were talking net this game checks all the boxes of that old school management sim list while also offering a more diverse and deep level of customization then you see in other games when you build a park it will be your park someone might use the same wall tiles but the love and effort and character you put into it will always be unique every time and i think thats kind of special 

anyway 3 a pound

#####

planet zoo is that game youve longed for

you played zoo tycoon when you were younger and felt like there has been a void ever since no longer 

welcome to planet may it satisfy your joy for zoo building as much as my own 

#####

the good
customization to the brim heck yeah sandbox mode you bet
 the amount of customization and creative aspect in this game is unlike anything weve ever seen absolutely puts all of the zoo tycoon games to shame if youve played planet coaster youll be in for a treat if youre looking for creativity
 a sandbox mode takes all of the terrible money and credit management from franchise mode and throws it out the window good for people who prefer a more creative or laid back experience
 developers frontier have listened to player bug feedback which is almost unheard of for any studio to do probably has to do with the backlash theyd gotten on jwe
 the art style appeals you wont mind the simple looking npcs while all of the animals look and feel alive in the game world graphics are overall fantastic 1
 the games challenge mode is well done enough it allows you to have all of the management but offline
 the story in the scenarios is at least something
 somewhat unrelated but youtubers like paulsley have done some excellent tutorials on how to get basic layouts done how to manage guest education and needs and everything else the game has a good youtube community overall

the bad
looking for friendly online communities good user interaction and intuitivelybuilt uis you may want to move right along
disclaimer you can avoid so many of the cons by not playing franchise mode ill mark said franchiserelated cons with an asterik 
  franchise modes animal market along with the problem that its the only way to obtain any new animals in game and being an always online sort of thing is filled with players who price even the most terrible or inbred animals at ridiculous prices
  conservation credits are very difficult to earn without doing intensive farming or exploits in franchise mode even on the easiest difficulty where guest happiness is usually never an issue they still come in at a molasseslike pace
  some players in the online community are really toxic when one player goes to uh slander the flaws and bugs in the game
 the developers have done some questionable monetisation including releasing very greedily overpriced dlc packs 10 dollars is a lot for just one dlc pack in this game if you want to save money youre better off getting the deluxe edition or premium edition on sale
 1 although i mentioned that the animal models and animations are fantastic some of the climbing animations can be rather wonky ruining immersion
 path placement is really wonky there will always be a time when you try to place a path only to get terrain modification failed best to smooth terrain before placing paths
 water placement is wonky similar to path placement obstructed it doesnt show a big red outline so you can figure out whats wrong only a portion of the outline
 the ui needs serious work theres a lot of minor issues i could go on for hours about that can ruin the management of the game
 building in this game is a doubleedged sword while super deep its also very complex the movement of pieces is like that of 3d modeling applications
 the games optimization is only subpar at best i average 50 percent cpu usage on an i7 8700k and my gpu gets around 40 percent when i have a gtx 1080ti both of which are nothing to scoff at the game also frequently hitches up and losing fps is not an uncommon issue seriously frontier not everyone has a 32 core system with 128gb of ram and dual rtx titans
 the npcs in the game tend to all act like karens sorry karens if their view of an animal is hampered by anything expect revenue losses for your zoo and ticket refunds if they have to walk just one extra step to get a drink or something from a vendor refunds oh they can hear a water treatment system that happened to be placed an inch too close more refunds
 all of the exhibit animals are virtually pointless some of them are cool but micromanaging them is a living hell while they almost never generate enough revenue for your zoo i would have liked to see some automation for releasing them that way overcrowding isnt a big deal with them
 theres a disturbing lack of some animals in this game although it nails the aspect of the most popular zoo animals theres literally no avians except for peafowls and theres no lynx moose or fox just for an example
 in sandbox mode you cannot just pickandchoose the animals genes and colorations you want say you want a leuscitic west african lion good luck youll have to breed them since theres no real animal market rather replaced with randomgen stuff 4 of each species 2 male 2 female and getting albinos that way is very rare i would have liked to see 2 albinos alongside the 4 regular ones

the ugly
unnecessary drm inclusion that only hurts the players
 denuvo antitamper paired with the games mediocre optimization really tortures even some of the best pcs on the market
final verdicts
although ive never been to any zoos in the real world and ill only spend my time in this game gawking at other players creations i can appreciate the positive and nonintrusive educational aspects that the game has the game is despite its issues overall good and definitely worth a shot if you enjoyed zoo tycoon or any similar games as this is basically its spiritual successor but no game is perfect this is another example of a game that could be almost perfect the game almost nails the management graphics are excellent and the animal selection in the game is acceptable enough despite the holes that add to a bit of emptiness or wish for x to be added and is hampered by subpar ui and optimization along with a very poor online aspect which is where most of the games problems come from if you want the dlc packs wait for a 25 percent off sale or more
for sandbox mode 90 out of 10
for franchise mode 40 out of 10
for challenge mode 70 out of 10
for scenarios 65 out of 10

like a good chunk of other players i was interested in playing this game because i spent way too much time as a child playing zoo tycoon 2

while this game is very good and does scratch the itch of a zoo simulator i would say it is not the perfect successor for the zoo tycoon series if that is what you are searching for

this game is is definitely geared more towards a micromanagment system which for me was a bit overwhelming initially you have to consider power grids poor environmental appearance noise etc following the scenarios and tutorials were a big help  i would not recommend diving into sandbox mode immediately i found the controls and gameplay to be less intuitive than zt2

that being said i do enjoy playing this game and the graphics are pretty spectacular i have a fairly highend pc so ive had no trouble running this but for those with lower specs the experience might be dampened somewhat i havent run into any major bugs apart from the fact that staff and guest can get stuck on pathways or objects if too crowded

my main point however about the difference between planet zoo and zt2 is that planet zoo lacks the zanyness and emergent gameplay ability that the tycoon series had you cant breed killer penguins you cant unleash tigers on the public so they would grab the guest by the pants and shake them around no random guests showing up in odd outfits or with peculiar names i also sorely miss some type of ground mode where you have a guestseye view of the park

planet zoo is great but its missing that spark that the tycoon series had its more dedicated to being realistic and almost corporate than a wacky zoo game if that is for you then you will enjoy this immensely

this is the first game that my 18 month daughter asks me to play she will point to my computer and start singing the theme song the animals are really realistic and its really fun and relaxing to play as you progress you unlock fun facts about each of the 65 species you can have in your zoo you can be really simple with your exhibits or make them full of water falls caves and much more this will require some youtube video help but its really worth it the mechanics are way easier than planet coaster and lots of new features of ui have been added its a legit simulator and theres lots of things i didnt think of having like walls with climb guards on them poor guest got terrorized by my gorilla almost killing them the soundtrack is very relaxing and really make it feel like a creative space to do whatever you want to do 

the only complaints i have 

1st some animals only like certain plants but sometimes when you look in the nature tab and put in their environment and continent filters they still wont like some of the plants that show up so you will have to go through every single one until you find the one you like 

2nd the water graphics are great until you see an animal move around in it when the animals move around in water they just put moving splashes around the animal its sad because they already have the ripple effect in the game with the water fall effects it just looks really tacky and could have been fixed really easy 

3rd when animals jump onto higher ground or objects it looks really bad their model freezes for the duration of the jump until they land so it looks pretty dumb with these realistic graphics 

these complaints are super picky i just hope that frontier sees them somehow and fixes them in future updates planet zoo is an awesome game though and i will definitely keep playing it and im sure when my daughter grows up she will play it all by herself someday thanks frontier for making a great game

i love this game i havent played it as much as some other people but i have definitely enjoyed it nearly as much as them there are lots of pros and cons and things i would like to see added to the game

pros
 the graphics are really nice you get a true zoo tycoon feel from it even if its planet zoo you know
 theres a lot of variety in cage designs you can do with the terrain options and gate choices you can do a lot with each exhibit and make it into your own place you know 
 its more real people can pickpocket other people people can vandalize your benches and trash cans the cage barriers can break people can come and protest ext that makes it fun because its more real
 you get more input for your zoo each exhibit has its own guest thoughts box which can tell you what you need more or less of what you need to fix ext 

cons
 super glitchy some zoo keepers wont stay in their designated work zone they wont feed the animals mechanics wont fix things when they break ext small things like that
 get super laggy i just bought a new computer with a graphics card way better then the required or recommended there is no reason for it to be laggy with a brand new computer that should be able to run the game plus 3 other games at the same time i dont do that but i should be able too my settings are all on low or medium because it gets so laggy super fast if you cant deal with lag dont get the game 
 not many animal choices theres around 30ish including the dlc about 12 of those animals are exhibit animals which dont even get their own enclosure but they do give spotlights to animals that wouldnt have had one in zoo tycoon like more prey animalsantelope bison ext 
 you need to plan your parks super well or guests will be unhappy about staff facilities i wish that you could cover them with rocks or trees to make them more appealing and less draining on guest happiness because if theyre in a red bubble for too long they leave
 the shy animals for some reason always get low social welfare for some reason for like 5 seconds and then it goes back up even with the 1 way glass on the right way like the snow leopard they can live alone so i usually have them living alone because the second the babies become adults they all fight but they get low social welfare for a few seconds but then it quickly rises not quite sure why it does that but it happens and it might cause protesters to arrive at your zoo

what i think should be added
personally i would like to see them add maybe a marine mania like they had in zoo tycoon or maybe add certain animals that they had in the original zoo tycoons but dont now like penguins kangaroos sloths leopards fennic fox gibbons lynx ethiopian wolf meerkat caracal beavers koalas mountain lions and moose id kill for a marine mania dlc it was fun in zoo tycoon and i believe it would be fun in planet zoo but i would like to see some of those lesser known animals in the game like the ethiopian wolf caracal and gibbons in the game to raise awareness about them 

overall i think its a wonderful game its fun and entertaining i could play it for days dont let my cons keep you from buying the game it might be better for you then it is me i hope this review helped

this was a hard choice but before the rabid fans attempt to tear my throat out let me explain 

this game does have a lot of positives

 you can really go wild and unleash your creativity and if youre not very creative no worries the community has made and continues to make a lot of wonderful creations and upload them to the workshop for you to use in your zoos

 huge range of building parts to play around with 

it is a stunning game visually with a lot of attention to detail the scenery is gorgeous 

 there is a nice range of modes to suit different play styles 

 generous sized maps to build your zoos on

 devs have been fairly consistent in addressing bugsthough each update tends to bring even more

 devs have been paying attention to player feedback though somewhat selective eg changed pack structure so theyre not constantly trying to murder each others faces but havent made any changes to guests having personal vendettas against staff buildings and even if you make the buildings pretty and surround them with trees or 10ft walls or put them in a tunnel system forcing your staff to become mole people yet the guests will still sense the buildings within the radius with their special staff building senses and it will ruin their time at the zoo 

 fairly good range of animals there are a lot of core animals missing but it seems fairly obvious they will be added later on in dlc 

 bernies dad jokes 

negatives
 for me one of the big reasons for not recommending the game is due to false advertising throughout beta and still on their planet zoo page it is advertised as this is copied directly from their site every animal in planet zoo is a thinking feeling individual with a distinctive look and personality of their own 

this is not true zebras and tigers have a couple of different stripe patterns some animals have a couple of different shades and there are white versions of most of the animals funnily enough the timber wolves didnt get a white version probably because theyd look too much like arctic wolves yes i know with some animals there is only so many colourspatternsmarkings to work with but there are a lot of animals ingame that could have a much bigger variety of colourspatternsmarkings where they just didnt even bother for example all the timber wolves look like they just multiply by mitosis  

 not to mention the personalities currently the animals have about as much personality as a raw potato they are also not very bright and struggle with simple concepts such as moving 10cm to the left to get out sight of the guests that are stressing them so much 

and before you say its a newly released game give them time i shouldnt have to if they couldnt follow through with their own advertising which was a big selling point for a lot of players they shouldve at least addressed it they havent even during beta they said that the full range of animations would be unlocked on release they werent  they only just recently added male peafowl fanning their tail feathers who knows what else is missing and yet theyre already putting out paid dlc

 many animals get stressed way too easily their constant stressing makes me stressed for example i have a wall of do not disturb signs around my flamingo enclosure with a path going over top part of their exhibit it is a huge exhibit with plenty of room away from the guests but still they live in a constant state of stress caused by guests breathing in their general direction animals would adjust to seeing people near their enclosure in zoos no 

 

 micromanagement this game has an insane amount of micromanagement you basically have to pause whenever you want to build or get things done because your animals are insanely frisky theres babies everywhere you blink and suddenly theyre grown up and have gone full alabama and now have made nephewsons if you teach them about the birds and the bees and give them contraception youll forget and theyll die of old age guests are like a bunch of super karens sorry karens who complain about everything and need food and drink every 2 metres mam this is a zoo not a restaurant and cant see the elephant right in front of them so will demand a refund it gets rather tedious managing so much and leaves you little time to actually enjoy your zoo

 pathing and building systems you dont know what youve done to them but they hate you and do everything to make life so much harder than it needs to be 

 lack of animations particularly between offspring and parent no nursing following no eggs from reptiles they just pop out babies like mammals maybe they identify as mammals and thats my bad for assuming


overall this game has a lot of potential and i do hope the devs follow through but i just dont think everybody should be throwing money at them until they address their false advertising even an announcement stating they are working on it and it will be implemented soon would be acceptable

h1this game was addicting when it came out but the veneer wore off and after all these years it still has serious flawsh1

allow me to edit this ancient review as its been years since i originally wrote it and many of my original complaints are no longer valid

bplanet zoo is not a zoo management gameb full stop it just isnt you dont have to manage anything it is a ibuildingi game which really makes you wonder why they would make the building such a frustrating experience

every time i try to get back into this game and i get the placement failed due to obstruction or terrain modification failed i become increasingly frustrated for a game that clearly tries to market itself as a peaceful building game it fails in every respect building has too many terrain constraints and unless your terrain is perfectly flat which is boring and anticreativity then you will have to suffer a thousand little cuts of frustration

staff need paths connecting their buildings or they cannot reach them even though they can walk across grass if a the path is deleted under them or b when theyre in a habitat they cannot cross grass to reach any of their important buildings paths must connect to an exhibit gate and the exhibit gate is a birch to get in the right spot say youre building a little island habitat for your dwarf caimans and you want your exhibit gate to lead onto the narrow island well your first try you realise that you cant raise the terrain near the gate and fence okay so delete that section of fencegate right okay but now you try to replace the gate and its underground for some reason okay so with a bit of mucking about you get the fence to be above ground again  but you cant place the gate because the attached path cant fit on the uneven gently uneven ground last i checked humans can walk over slightly uneven ground its not like im placing the gate on the summit of mt everest

placing fences is equally annoying but only because you cant just paint the fences along you have to place down chunks it feels clunky and antifun most games would just let you slap those fences down with very little effort but planet zoo likes to really make you work for your fences fences are definitely not why anyone wants to play this game so why does it have to be such a time consuming process

placing foliage and terrain paint is also clunky in jwe2 placing foliage has a paint tool you can just paint the ground and the foliage springs up with ease thats qol planet zoo has you slowly sort through their annoying poorly designed antihuman intuition menus and place each individual tree and plant animals also cannot pathfind through tall grasses such as common reeds or elephant grass even though they require these things as part of their habitat it also constrains how much land they are allowed to walk on

now lets talk about where the game tries to recoup itself on management animals eventually get bored of their enrichment items and you have to place new ones this is so tedious and annoying in reality what should happen is you purchase the enrichment items and your keepers should automatically switch them out for you that would be a good management feature but thats not how it works instead you must physically remove the old ones and then add new ones which means you cant place all of them at once your animals will get bored its just frustrating and annoying

overall this building game is antifun i used to enjoy it but every time i try to play now i play for a max an hour before im reminded what a frustrating experience this game is the developers have no desire to add more qol features to their building and instead operate on the punch out more dlc business model that frontier shares with the likes of paradox and creative assembly

planet zoo vanilla with no dlc is barebones and unplayable for most newcomers frontier ensured you must buy the dlc to have even a modicum of fun and if you can look past the frustration of building in this game then it just might be for you but for patient gamers or artists like myself that have 800 hours in rimworld and clearly enjoy managing building and a challenge  this game doesnt offer that it offers clunky controls and frustration at every turn

fun and cool because i raise capybara


#####

zoo tycoon used to be my life i got older i bought planet zoo planet zoo is now my life

#####

i dont know what happened one minute i was ten years old casually enjoying zoo tycoon now i am in my late twenties and planet zoo has stolen my life away i am okay with this i never want it back

#####

great game only issue i have is this company doesnt sell complete games they split what should be a single game into multiple dlc so never pay full price for these games

#####

it has the bones to be a very good game and esp as someone working in conservation i appreciate how much effort they put into working conservation  education in rather than making it another moneymaker simulator but it does have issues i hope will be addressed in updates that make it difficult to fully endorse for now
pacing issues often your animals will be overpopulated before youve even finished the habitat i pause constantly to work around this but the game speed is far too fast
crashes seems almost at random have had 4 different crashes doing 4 different things including idling while looking at my phone
laying paths no idea if im just doing something wrong but laying down paths is a proper chore often not connecting to other paths properly and going at weird angles

outside of proper complaints but id like to see more diversity of animals theyre mostly mammals an aviary or aquarium mechanic would be really cool i imagine this will be in future updates or dlc

strengths conservation aspects
gorgeous graphics

if youre an animal lover but also enjoy your basic city building games then id definitely recommend this

likes 
 its actually great at educating you on loads of different species
 the graphics are beautiful so you end up obsessing over cute animals also when you manage to create an impressive enclosure your zoo can look like a slowly evolving masterpiece
 the campaign acts as a great tutorial so would recommend playing this before jumping into your own zoo
 the whole focus is about animal welfare so it really speaks to us animal lovers out there

dislikes
 understandably animal movements can glitch out when they try manoeuvre around enclosures but this doesnt impact gameplay its only annoying when the odd animal glitches on the edge of an enclosure and escapes also when animals climb on items such as lemurs climbing on wooden structures they can look odd and not as realistic as other animals
 for someone who doesnt have a lot of patience creating custom buildings is quite difficult so i end up using the basic blueprints however you can download structures from steam for your game so this isnt too much of an issue

i dont have any other issues with the game and overall have spent many days playing definitely one of my favourites in my library and easily addictive

#####

i have mixed feelings about planet zoo i want to love it so bad but i was not prepared for the intensity of this game
if you love being in control of every aspect of an extremely detailed management game this is for you but this is not your casual zoo management game if youre deciding whether or not to buy it because you grew up on zoo tycoon or maybe youve seen the amazing planet zoo builds on youtube and you thought to yourself hey that looks fun and not stressful at all lets pump those brakes bucko because youre in for a ride of your life 

learning the controls was a challenge all its own building things was not easy  now again if you love to have complete freedom and the patience to make whatever you want how ever you want it then you might not have an issue with the build mode but its not just as easy as click and place do yourself a favor and find a tutorial on youtube before trying to figure it out yourself because its a lot

once you have the controls down we can get into the gameplay
there is absolutely no chill 
none 
just when you think there is oops youre snow leopard just jumped out of its enclosure and oh no youre mechanic cant reach the workshop and your panda just died in front of everyone and youre turtles are freezing to death and the bears are fighting for dominance and   theres too much trash and people are complaining dont get me wrong i love my games with some chaos but it gets to a point sometimes where im pausing the game every few minutes to fix the problems so if youre trying to enjoy your cute animals running around it can be very short lived when i tell you you run everything i mean literally everything the animals enclosures employees the guests and buildings all have their own needs that have to be met you will play this game for hours upon hours from the sheer amount of things that must be done to make the zoo run smoothly youre probably like well duh its a management game of course you run everything but im just trying to prepare you because i was not 

it sounds like im really hating on this game but im not trying to this game is beautiful and the attention to detail is nothing like ive ever experience in a management game once you get into the routine of the game and the flow of how everything works it can be enjoyable i really love creating the enclosures for the animals because they all need different things to be happy like how much or little grass the types of plant life temperature and enrichment  i just wish there was a mode for those who want to play on the casual side and have a more simplified building mode option im used to playing games like the sims or acnh where the building mode is super simple and i was half expecting something like that but thats not how it is and thats ok just be aware

planet zoo is zoo designing and management game duh which offers a wide variety of animals features and gameplay

the game is similar to planet coaster but offers more management although its designing or building simulator first and management second
you build habitats and exhibitions and adopt animals exhibitions are pretty simple those are smaller buildings for small animals like frogs snakes bugs etc theres not much to design when it comes to exhibitions you can add some items but thats it of course you can design the exterior as you wish

habitats is where the fun is you build them from the scratch so unleashing your creativity here feels nice first you build a wall door and then start building everything inside like shelters climbable objects putting in toys food enrichment items and so on you can also put some flora in there to make animals feel like theyre in their own environment also things like rocks stumps and other objects
the game gives you a total freedom you have hundreds of items to choose from and you can combine them with each other like for example put one onto another literally any item you can rotate them they can overlap and clip in general you can build anything on top of that you can add decorations any kind you want so that your park fit the theme you like

you also need to take care of animals for exhibitions you basically put the right temperature and humidity levels assign some staff and thats it for habitats its a bit more complex since those animals have more needs so you need to carefully pick the enrichment items food surroudings and of course the animal numbers
each animal has its own entry in the zoopedia there you can learn what those animals are what they like what climate they prefer which region theyre coming from and what pack size they prefer living in for example some animals are ok living in huge packs but others dont like that so you need only one male and one female or few females alpha males or females could start fighting and that leads to injuries
so theres some kind fo animal management which is nice but nothing too difficult
then theres the whole business aspect building shops toilets staff rooms and satisfying everyones needs shops and other buildings for visitors are pretty much the same as it was in planet coaster its simple look at the needs build a shop accordingly you can choose from variety of different shops with different themes and as always you put your own creations to make look as you wish

then theres staff staff takes care of the animals mostly works at shops or keep the park safe youll need lots of staff rooms but those have a negative impact on visitors so you need to put them out fo their way remember visitors supposed to only see the pretty side of your park

another mechanic is research again its pretty straightforward but gives you nice rewards so to unlock new items you assign your workers to research that unlocks new buildings new decorations enrichment items and so on each animal has its own research tree
vets can also research illnesses and there are a lot of those yes your animals can get ill and even die seeing the animal die is always painful but you cant escape reality on the other hand animals have offspring too so youll see a lot of tiny and cute animals being born

there are also conservation points you acquire those by releasing animals to the wild only some can be released and by greeting your friends
oh and one new interesting mechanic is visitor education you need to set up displays for visitors which have information about animals and hire educators

in general this game feels like some designing tool almost as an app or something with game mechanics on top i personally love it but i can see why people could dislike it the management part of the game isnt very deep so if you want this purely for management aspect then look elsewhere while management is deeper than it was in planet coaster its still not deep enough for someone who want only that
on the other hand its totally fine as it is i dont want lots of micromanagement in such game i just want to build

another thing i should mention are game modes theres the usual career mode which doesnt require any explanation then theres franchise mode where you build a huge park in certain area although im not sure how its different from sandbox mode maybe cause of online integration you can see your steam friends coming into your park and you can greet them to receive conservation points
another mode is challenge mode which again doesnt need any explanation so plenty to choose from for everyones taste

the game isnt a 100 simulator and i dont want it to be but is realistic enough to satisfy both  sim fans and casual players

now many people could be scared by a bunch of dlc yes theres a lot of dlc but you dont need them you only may want them want more variety by a dlc you think you may like theyre not expensive and add new animals and a bunch of items

oh and did i mention workshop support youre not creative yourself lazy dont have enough time download anything you like from the workshop and enjoy their creations

graphically the game is stunning it looks pretty much the same as planet coaster but the main focus here are animals and let me tell you the animal models are amazing even the tiny exhibit animals are modeled to the highest standards every animals is highly detailed and looks great from a very close distance you can observe them by yourself or ingame camera tool

performance is pretty good game has plenty of graphics options and runs great played on 5800x rtx3080 32gb 3440x1440
ultrawide support is out of the box and it looks great

sounds hmm i didnt pay much attention since i usually listen to spotify when i play these kind of games but from what i remember it has that uplifting soundtrack similar to planet coaster the animal sounds are awesome of course i listened to those sounds authentic and adds a layer of realism cant say much more about the sound

overall and amazing game for people who love animals who maybe even want to learn something about them due to zoopedia for those who love to design their own stuff while having complete freedom to do so for those who enjoy building and management games its for you buy the base game its cheap on sale at least try it

list
well detailed animals

feels quite realistic while being casual enough

hi everyone

so ive seen a lot of positivity for this game and actually bought it because a youtuber of mine played it and i thought it looked soooo fun i spent around i think 4 hours at first in it and thought it was like the game zoo tycoon which is another game by frontier now before i get into this allow me to explain a few things first and why i am going to be comparing it to zoo tycoon and not the original zoo tycoon i refer to the zoo tycoon that came out in 2013 and has since been made for the pc you can look it up as it is on steam i had it before adding it to my review

so in zoo tycoon you place down prebuilt habitats and scenery and yeah  it isnt very great when it comes to wanting to create a zoo how you want and design everything
in addition you still have to manage animals and make sure your habitats dont get crowded and now i could potentially be wrong on this the animals arent portrayed properly as in in zoo tycoon the animals dont die thus its really sandboxlike and you can go through the game with the same animals and never have to worry about buying more in addition the only realistic thing it has is when it comes to how zookeepers enrich herbivores like gazelle zebras elephants and such

now heres why my rant ends on zoo tycoon and my review for planet zoo officially begins

so in planet zoo you have to manage a zoo in all its glory you have to entertain guests needs ie food drink restroom and even energy and education you have to take into consideration how you build not only the habitat but the zoo around it so not only guests can access everything but your staff can as well 

i personally view this game as a realistic zoomanagement game and while you build this beautiful zoo you have to take small seconds to manage that group of peafowl whove bred from 4 to 30 in less than an hour as peafowl and one of the few animals that breed a lot and oh no your springboks are about to inbreed so you gotta stop and put x on contraceptives or sell him quick however that is realistic a zoo isnt about sunshine and roses and watching money rake in while you plop down premade enclosures no its about making sure you actually are making money and creating a zoo experience for your guests that doesnt consist of unhappy animals and tired staff that dont want to do anything and also its about planning out how you want the zoo to look and imagine how the guests feel when they walk through the doors

before you purchase i heavily recommend checking a youtubers gameplay out of the game and seeing every thing first before you go  yes i want click to avoid negative reviews that are 100 inaccurate on the game or just incredibly onesided and only focus on whats bad about the game a good youtuber for this would be seripixelbiologist shes one of my favorite youtubers and her community is great

so heres what i like about the game
 gorgeous graphics and the ability to switch them down if you have a graphics card that cant handle the highest settings
 accurate depictions of animal behavior and accurate depictions of animal violence do not place gazelles with cheetahs ie they will be hunted
 accurate depiction of zoo management  its not suppose to be easy but if you think its a little hard try sandbox and switch things off in game settings
 ability to build beautiful zoos and habitats and just go crazy with my imagination
 ability to create indoor habitats for my peafowl lemurs and even my lions and such while still showcasing a naturalistic vibe when it comes to terrain and plantlife within their habitat
 a variety of enrichment for each animal so if an animal gets bored you can just switch out the enrichment 
 accurate breeding dynamics in franchise and sandbox you have a chance of getting albino animals spotless cheetahs and so on this definitely isnt the sims looks to sims 4
 the ability to prevent animals from breedinginbreeding using contraceptives thus you can let numbers explode as long as you keep on top of family trees and that the habitat has enough space
 for those less creative there are premade things so you dont have to fiddle around with making something you can also download other users creations from the workshop
 realistic depictions of animal preferences unlike in zoo tycoon the original one anyway animals wont get 100 angry about that one extra acacia or that african daisy you used around the base of a shelter  i mean as long as you dont put 100 plants that arent from its natural habitat youre golden
 the ability to raiselower rocks trees and such to create beautiful landscapes naturalistic barriers and even naturalistic climbable objects for your big cats and sheep and such


bugs ive seen explained

 boxed animal
 if you say edited a habitat too close to an animal the animal is boxed and moved to the front of the enclosure so its out of the way while you edit
randomly boxed animals i find are because the animal moves into an area that isnt easily traversable or it gets stuck while still a bug it can be easily worked around by making sure your habitats are 100 percent traversable now how do you do this theres actually a little button on the lower left portion of the screen that has a sliding button click it and locate the traversable terrain section you can check to make sure everything in your zoo is traversible  for guests for individual animals or for staff

 keepers wont feed
keepers feed animals once in a while and wont feed them again until its time so if your animals are starving its likely because there arent enough feeders typically if you have a population of 8 you need 2 feeders add one feeder per every 8 animals in a habitat ie a habitat of 24 flamingos will need 3 feeders whereas a habitat of 8 gazelle will only need 1 in addition you have to place feeders in an open area that is also traversable for the keeper and make sure they are spaced apart enough the animals can access each one

  stressed out animals no space
now i recently discovered some animals ie lemurs and aardvarks dont really like people in their habitat as much as say peafowl this is because these animals are shyer than peafowl they will usually get stressed if anywhere near the aforementioned humans so what i did was make a habitat with 2 guest doors and a path hidden by one way glass the humans could look at the animals but the animals arent aware only do this if you have an area with nothing in it that the animals may want to get to and make sure the glass is at the same height as the rest of the habitat but isnt marked as a perimeter of the habitat

in addition no spacestress related to could refer to an overpopulated area ie i find that animals that breed quick will get upset if they are in an area of say 700 square feet while there is a population of say 30 this is because you need to understand that the bare minimum for space for each specie  is for the bare minimum of how many animals can be in that habitat thus most of my enclosures consisting of fastbreeding animals tend to float into the 1000 square feet range instead not sure if square feet is the used metric system in game though correct me if im wrong on that

thats all


note
i have edited my post and added some more details i missed originally

planet zoo is a game that i think a lot of people including myself have been waiting a very long time for if like me you were one of those people who played the hell out of zoo tycoon when you were a kid youd probably agree that there hasnt really been a good zoo management game in a very long time yes we dont talk about the countless awful reboot attempts

frontier obviously caught well on this as theyve definitely hit the mark its amazing how something so new and so fresh can feel so nostalgic at the same time planet zoo takes everything that made zoo tycoon so good and enhances it tenfold it has the same level of investment and addiction that the original games had whilst providing gorgeous visuals and an immense amount of creative freedom

if youve ever played planet coaster you would notice the similarities between that and planet zoo obviously its made using the same engine and some of its core features such as the pathing tool and the facilities have carried over to this game except instead of having rides we have animal exhibits that are fully customisable like zoo tycoon you create your exhibits in accordance to your animals needs and welfare which plays an important role in having a reputable zoo

as well as managing your animals needs you must also attend to the needs of your visitors all of the needs from zoo tycoon such as hunger thirst etc carry over into this game with the addition of an education need which can be provided by information signs or speakers managing the needs of both your animals and guests can be challenging at times which after spending some time on the game you will quickly realise that the challenge is both good and bad 

whilst having the challenge makes it more entertaining there is one problem time time seems to move very fast in this game creating exhibits can take quite a bit of time because of this either a lot of things will be happening in the background that will require your attention or the animals you are creating an exhibit for are already having babies this gets more annoying the more animals you have you can pause time in the game but it does get irritating and monotonous having to do that every single time 

as i mentioned before the visuals are stunning each and every animal has been designed with so much attention to detail what you see in the screenshots is exactly what you will see in the game its so entertaining to just watch the animals the animations are incredible and they act like real animals would the game itself is quite well optimised as well so seeing these visuals in action shouldnt be a problem as well as the animals the environment details are just as good 

the game provides the player with a massive amount of creative freedom almost everything is customisable you can construct buildings brick by brick and can make your own gardens you can edit the ground both terrain wise and sculpture wise you are also able to share your constructions online with other people and can download other peoples creations and use them in your zoo there is a real sense of community in this game that makes you feel like your not playing alone

there is one major problem i have with this game though and it is a problem with many strategy games theres too much micromanagement its noticeable straight away you have to have certain buildings to be able to do certain things you have to manage water electricty education as well as the animals needs and the guests needs and in some cases the staffs needs sometimes youll encounter problems that dont have any obvious solutions which can damper the creative freedom the game gives you an example of this is the pathing system and how restrictive it can be sometimes in terms of where you can place the path 

all in all though this game is fantastic if you were a fan of zoo tycoon this game is a must buy if you are looking for a zoo management game or just any management game in general then this game is definitely worth a shot theres plenty of content to keep you here for hours and hours upon end just be aware and prepared for its shortcomings id give this a 910

the game is great but i hate the fact that there are 58 adoptable animals locked behind dlc paywall 61 if you count deluxe edition and thats about as many as the base game offer but at triple the price i know the dlcs also include new scenery objects alongside but it makes no sense to charge triple the base game price to unlock that many animals its a total cash cow whats worse is that frontier development continues to expand that list as of today at this rate there will be more animals locked behind overpriced paywalls than the base game offers

#####

this game has completely satisfied the void left inside of me after years of not having zoo tycoon 2 in my life  not only that it exceeded any expectations  its beautiful its challenging its a great game

#####

i just spent 2 hours and 30000 dollars to make a shitty looking tunneling otter exhibit so you can see under the water but the otters i bought dont like the exhibit i built and now my penguins need to be quarantined and the sheep are inbreeding and one of them escaped on top of all this the inspector said my guests arent getting educated enough and the guests think the hamburgers cost too much and i keep losing money on the gift shops and my janitor is going to quit soon because hes bored

but its all worth to get close ups on the high res penguins waddling around

#####

i wish there was a middle rating for steam reviews because this game has some serious issues but has enough depth and creativity to be an extremely enjoyable game and one i can already tell i love despite its flaws

lets get the good out of the way 

the presentation of this game is fantastic the art style and lighting make this game very easy on the eyes and it hightens a certain other aspect of the game ill get into in a little bit the sound design is also great with every animal sounding how it should and the ambiance allowing for the game to create some surprisingly atmospheric tones to the exhibits you make the best part is the music though i cant gush about the music enough its some of if not the best music put into a tycoon game and it ranges from solid to genuinely moving whoever they got to do the music needs a raise a bonus and a medal cause im still humming those tunes while im trying to sleep

the animals are lovingly detailed and are interesting to watch they play with each other they have good pathfinding they have their own visual personalities they even climb over the playsets you make for them keeping them alive happy and healthy isnt too challenging and thats a good thing since youre going to have a lot of animals theres some educational summaries of them too if youre curious about your favorite virtual pets this is a far cry from the pile of mediocrity that was jurassic world evolution and it shows me that frontier has learned some valuable lessons from that game frontier knew right from the get go how to execute the animal handling and exhibit management in this game and they did a good job for the most part for the most part

however though the animals are the games main theme they are just a backdrop to planet zoos real star of the show the buildings words can barely describe how good the building system in this game is if youve played planet coaster you already know what im talking about the best way i can describe it is that the buildings are extremely modular and can be put together by impressively versitile building blocks the landscaping tools are simple enough for easy and intuitive use whilst retaining the ability to create intricate terrain cave systems and lakes if that wasnt enough you can even fine tune certain objects to get them in juuust the right position where it makes the most visual sense for them to be you can build almost literally anything your heart desires and there are some absolutely breathtaking building and park designs that are floating around on the games forums and subreddit you can truly make your zoo and is without a doubt in my mind the single best aspect about this game 

now with all that being said 

two things that are kind of mixed and your mileage may vary on whether you agree or not

the user interface in this game is lacking it provides all the information it needs to convey and it has a slick and clean aesthetic but it feels unintuitive and clunky its way more laggy than it has any right to be and everything feels like it takes too many clicks to get to which adds up to a lot of dead time but it can still be learned simple enough and is usable so this is a  sort of mixed bag

the small exhibits for frogs snakes and bugs are a hassle to deal with they require too much micro managing and there is not enough interesting decisions to be made with them to make them feel like a worthy part of the zoo if there were automated population controlling mechanics in place i might reconsider this opinion

now for the big problems with this game

franchise mode is kind of bad frontier always has hiccups when it comes to actually trying to design a management game and this is no exception the early game is already too harsh since it barely gives you enough money to do anything except for a single enclosure and the facilities you need to make them you can try making some interesting buildings at the start but if you do youre risking going bankrupt youve just start since the game and already its discouraging you from playing with its best features and then the game expects you to build your zoo slowly and i do mean slowly as guests and money trickles in on top of this you cant even build with the building blocks you want to yet because theyre locked behind tech trees as are the toys and other animal enrichment items so when you place an animal in its exhibit you cant even meet all of its needs yet thats on top of having to wait for the slow and unstable pace by which your income crawls so you spend the game waiting and waiting and waiting to do the things you actually want to do and it brings the games pacing to a grinding halt just like jwe franchise mode suffers from needless and excessive padding its a godsend that this game has a sandbox mode

ive saved the worst for last the mind boggling poor design decision in this game that shows that frontier either has misguided ambitions or suffers from systemic and selective crippling incompetence the animal market oh good god the animal market there is not a single thing about this that i dont loathe the user interface for it is terrible and makes the rest of the ui in this game look like og zoo tycoons in comparison it is extremely laggy and barely works half of the time you use if youre lucky you have to adopt animals individually and there is no way to select multiple animals at once and since this is also an online market the animal you wanted to get has a chance of getting nabbed by another player while youre still trying to check out since the interface keeps fing lagging all the time did i mention it lags constantly instead of having a grid of animals to choose from it offers you individuals of all the species in the game and you have to scroll down or use the filters to get the animal you actually want which forces you to engage with this horrendous blemish on this game and adds even more dead time spent trying to get the market menu to cooperate the worst part the final and most painful aspect of this abysmal mechanic this blight on this game is that the animal market is the only way you can get animals period even jurassic world evolution got this part right frontier 
ill stop right there cause there is so much i hate about the animal market and i just want it replaced but in the meantime you can minimize your time spent with it actually doing the fun stuff in sandbox mode 

all in all planet zoo is a good game it could even be great should frontier fix these issues however this game is two step forwards one step backwards it feels like its trying to wrestle with you for control over your playstyle or like your dad spending an hour trying to tinker with the toy you just opened from your birthday present if frontier can make the ui more responsive trash the animal market and replace it with something else then this game is the real true successor to zoo tycoon

however in the mean time i dont think i can recommend it in good conscious as it is right now even if i do really like this game keep an eye on it and stay interested but be cautious

edit so i may have been a bit hasty on the animal market the way it is laid out is still bad not particularly user friendly and  the system in which you gain the ingame credits for it is a bit too tedious to my liking but it is much less laggy and thus much more tolerable in the offline sandbox and challenge modes everything i said about it in my initial review still applies for franchise mode though if you want the franchise experience without the horrendous online market challenge mode is basically the exact same mode and is thus the superior option by default

there are many things planet zoo does right the freedom  of creativity is massive the animals are beautifully rendered with loving details and even just the base game comes with a laundry list of possible animals to adopt create homes for and tailor to their specific needs in this regard pz knocks it out of the park

however the problem with the gameand its biggest sticking point for meis that it is just so goddamn frustrating to try and play paths fences and tracks are all massive headaches to try and build and building them are pretty much the groundwork of the entire game so how can it possibly feel this bad and unresponsive 

while you can link paths to run along fences you can not link fences to run along paths which i find baffling  like in planet coaster paths can only be placed by choosing a length first and then placing the path down while that is as annoying now as it was then whats worse is that it applies to fences too youll be spending half you time fiddling with each piece of fence trying to make a habitat that looks like it wasnt built by a blind madman and while yes you can go in afterwards grab the fence posts and pull them around to adjust them you can only do this to one post at a time so if for example there is a whole corner or curve you need to fix youll be doing it one piece at a time

one of the final annoyances is that paths can not be linked up to any construction pieces meaning that if you were hoping to build nice indoor sections to your zoo you better hope you line up your walls perfectly as there is no good way to do this other than eyeballing it

overall planet zoo isnt a bad game and i honestly wish that i could give this a mixed review instead of a hard thumbs down but the fact isfor all the things the game does do rightthe problem areas are so baked into the core aspects and functions of this game that there is no way to avoid them and they feel like exhausting to fight with while you try and flex your creative muscles

#####

first off im a very old frt so if i can manage this game  anyone can ive done two zoos so far a starter with only a couple enclosures my second one is what id call intermediate beginner im doing enclosures for 56 animals and switching it up to include barriers and moatsnull barriers obviously this will be a fairly large layout if youre a fussy perfectionist like me planet zoo will be an additional challenge because getting all the roads barriers and other objects to line up perfectly can be daunting especially with shaky hands  but thats my métier ive been doing digital gaming for over 25 years and without reservations i can commend planet zoo enjoy

#####

i love how detailed it is the complexity creativity variety and the seemingly endless possibilities which this game has to offer i do not like the fact that i have to buy dlc almost every other month in order to be able to enjoy the game in its entirety and also  would love flying birds 3  

#####

really love the graphics and details but it is a steep learning curve biggest complaint is that the path system is really wonky and causes a lot of headache i love the genetics addition to the game and the ability to create your own buildings and highly detailed customization wish there was a zookeeper mode and the ability to set yourself a budget in sandbox

something i do miss from this games predecessor though probably wasnt something zoo tycoon 2 meant for users to do is going into sandbox mode closing the zoo and then just creating a wildlife tycoon of our own design multiple animals just unleashed together to live and breed and get eaten or die of old age

#####

my latest autistic hyperfixation

#####

please note this is my own personal experience lots of people love this game this is just how i feel

it feels like you have to fight the game in order to play it thats the best way i can describe it 
please keep in mind  i bought this because i was hoping it would be similar to the zoo tycoon franchise i wasnt expecting an identical game i was expecting as good or better given it was released years afterwards
 i dont feel like i got that

heres what i love about this game

the graphics are stunning especially the animals

theres some really cool ideas like exhibits protesters etc 

its clear that they tried to make zoo tycoon but better the heart was there they made an effort

heres what i cant stand about this game

clunky unintuitive controls why cant i just make a square block of path without having to jump through a million hoops and then still have it not look right  why doesnt the tutorial actually teach you how the controls work properly why is so much of this game just click everything until you figure it out
 i dont think im just stupid because i dont have this problem with other games i genuinely dont understand how people are building these amazing exhibits 

sometimes you just cant place something on what looks like completely clear and flat space and it will not tell you why everything also has to connect to a path  which would be fine if the pathing wasnt stupid but the pathing is stupid

 the bugs oh my god the bugs i just spent ten minutes trying to place a building in the tutorial looked it up  turns out that parts just broken and the only real solution is click until it works i also have regular issues with keepers just not being able to clean exhibits no matter what i do i actually googled it to see if keepers can clean them its that consistent of a problem
zoo tycoon 2 solved the potential zoo keeper problem by having you be able to clean enclosuresetc if the keeper doesnt show up planet zoo has no such solution youre just stuck

 tutorial restrictions the tutorial zoos turn off certain features this is supposed to make the game easier thing is i just did two tutorials in a row where it made the game harder because i was running into issues that would have been easily fixed had i not been restricted 
example one needed a certain number of species to continue the only habitat species i could place required water there was nowhere on the map where i could build an accessible habitat with enough water because i wasnt allowed to access terrain tools i ended up spamming exhibits instead 
example two this ones two parts part one was the building glitch i encountered above the reason that sections broken is because theres another building in the way of the one youre trying to place  and you cannot move that other building you also cant place the building youre meant to build literally anywhere else on the map you have to build it in this tiny square 
part two of that was that once again i needed to hit a certain number of species  and from the look i had there was absolutely no space on the map with which to do this again terrain tools completely disabled so i cant fix it guess i would have to spam exhibits again 

 mechanics not explained well enough i still dont know where im supposed to put staff facilities so that they actually cover everything that needs to be covered but the guests cant see them i tried everything again i can figure out basically every other game i play so i really dont think im just dumb but maybe i am

the dlc is actual trash like horse armour levels of trash you get like five new animals per pack i can buy dlcs for other games that are practically a whole new game for the same price as these five or so animal packs dont buy the dlcs until they go on sale you are wasting your money 
for comparison zoo tycoon 2 only needed four dlc for a complete zoo experience  including marine animals which we only just got in planet zoo and dinosaurs which i suspect will never be released in planet zoo due to the existence of the jurassic world franchise

i really really wanted to love this game but i dont want a zoo simulation game to stress me out and thats what this game does i feel like it had some great ideas but it fails with so many basic gameplay things that a game ten years older than it already had down pat and to me thats inexcusable if a much older game can figure it out a modern game should be able to
if you dont have any experience with this kind of game planet zoo might be for you  because youd have nothing else to compare it to but for me this game just makes me want to go back to zoo tycoon because at least i dont feel like im fighting the game every step of the way

#####

looking for a way to pass the quarantine  ive got 18 hours in 2 days  i am 25 through the campaign with tons of stuff to still learn  deep customization design management of business and environments and a few bugs  this is the best 35 you can spend right now
buy it and try it

#####

when i was younger i would play zoo tycoon 2 all day long and i didnt realise until the zoo tycoon game came out in 2013 the really bad one how much i missed playing a zoo game ive waited basically 10 years for a game like this to come out and i couldnt be happier frontier have made some of my favourite games from the last few years such as planet coaster and jurrassic world evo and when i saw they were making this game i got so hyped for i bought the deluxe edition to play the beta and i played it for about 2 hours cause i wanted to save myself for the full release which was the the right choice  building habitats is unique theres so much flexibility construction is complex but once you get your head around it it can be insanely easy to build a structure the themes are nice and there are lots of plants to chose fromnow when it comes to the animals its almost as if they are as lifelike as they can geti love how  the animals have their own characteristics and habits
the only thing i dislike about the game is the staff they can be very stubborn and will never do what i ask them too and then protesters come in to the park cause the keepers wont feed my animalsnext to that this game is outstanding
i have to say this game is worth every penny 1010 would recommend

#####

cons
 it barely explains the controls
 building can be a massive pain
 trying to set up work zones and keep employees happy requires an engineering degree or something

pros
 the animals are cute
 once you figure things out you can build some pretty impressive zoos
 you can make custom buildings to house your employee buildings and save the blueprints for use in other zoos
 the career mods story line is kind of interesting

def recommend playing career mode to learn the game since it also unlocks decorations for you to use in other zoos mostly animal statues but theyre kinda cute animal statues i didnt expect there to be a sort of story line with career mode when i started it but there is and its kind of interesting to follow along in some of the animals can be annoying with how quickly they breed since their numbers cna very quickly get out of control peacocks especially are bad about that if youre not careful youll end up with more than your keepers can keep up with having to manage waste power guest happiness employee happiness and animal happiness is a fun challenge and feels like a big step up from the old zoo tycoon games i got this a while ago looking for something similar to zoo tycoon quit for awhile because i got frustrated with the controls but picked it back up again recently and now that im figuring things out and googling everything i cant figure out on my own im having a lot more fun with it if youre going to play id recommend looking up guides and videos to watch andor listen to while you start out

best zoo simulation on steamlots animals with good management systemdetailed habitats and good construction tools to build zoo i like
i hope they add sea animalsso i can make a giant aquarium in my zoo

#####

this game is probably one of my favorite games ever i was afraid the animals would just stand in one spot and do nothing but whine to be fed every once in a while but the animals actually move around and interact with their environment its like watching real life animals my only problem with this game is that i got addicted and bought all the dlcs i hope theres more animals and downloadable content in the future

#####

giraffe

#####

i love this game i played the disc version of zoo tycoon for years when i was younger when i saw this game in developments i became so excited and damn has this game delivered it does feel a bit more complicated compared to the zoo tycoon games but it still captures the feel for me i love doing the scenarios playing in the sandbox and just watching my animals to me this game is beautiful and the sound track and sounds in general are amazing

#####

i actually cant believe that i never wrote a review for planet zoo before when you are reading this you are probably new to planet zoo and wondering if you should get it or not well let me introduce myself to you then

my name is deladysigner and you can find me on youtube for plenty of planet zoo videos sandbox builds and lets plays and also tutorials to get yourself familiar with the game which i highly recommend watching if you are new to the planet games 

ive been playing the game since day one and i cant believe how much the game has improved since then and how many amazing new features are added during that time this game is fun for everyone whether you just like to enjoy the cute beautiful animals and their interactions with each other and managing your zoo but are not such a great builder you can download amazing blueprints from the steam workshop to still build the zoo of your dreams without too much effort 

but clearly when you do like to build a zoo completely from scratch all by yourself you can really eat your heart out in the beginning you may really need some tutorials to figure out all the amazing possibilities you have in planet zoo but once you get a hang of it you are absolutely going to love the freedom and endless possibilities in this game not to mention the fact how often you will just stand still and enjoy the incredible beautiful animals roaming or swimming around playing and interacting with each other in the beautiful habitats you create for them

do i sound like a walking ad here yeah pretty cringy maybe but honestly its all just so true and it really comes from the bottom of my heart i have never stopped playing the game since i got it in 2019 and i cant believe how addicted i still am to this incredible game until this day 

i mostly played sandbox mode the past few years but a few months ago i picked up franchise mode again which made me even more addicted and in love with the game than ever before something i really did not think would happen after playing this game for such a long time already 

i am pretty sure old or young creative or not you will love this game for sure

#####

you cant throw protesters into the lion habitat disappointed

#####

you can own capybaras for 9

#####

this game is exactly what ive wanted since i was a kid its one of the few games i dont regret buying even for a second 469 hours in and i still cant get enough

the perfect game for you if you
 are creative
 like management
 love designing buildings  landscape architecture
 love details
 appreciate freedom with what you can design
 appreciate animals  nature

cons
you need a bit of a monster pc later on when your zoo has grown colossal but other than that theres no limit whatsoever to what you can designbuild

#####

a game like this has always been my dream i grew up playing the first two zoo tycoon games and after the somewhat disappointing 2013 soft reboot i wondered if wed ever get a game that would beat out zoo tycoon 1  2 if you liked or grew up on the zoo tycoon games or even the wildlife park games this game is a nearperfect successor while it doesnt feature the same exotic creatures that the former two franchises had such as dinosaurs or massive whales it makes up for it with its expansive creative features that allow you to create practically anything you can imagine planet zoo improves on the expansive creativity abilities that its spiritual predecessors founded using the numerous building materials you can create anything you imagine the only main gripe is the same one i have for planet zoo which is the path controls paths are incredibly hard to get used to at least for me and i much prefer path options like those in roller coaster tycoon or zoo tycoon 1  2

#####

i very much recommend it was fun to fun the play in multiple franchises and raise animals it was also fun the decorate the habitats and the zoo

anyone growing up playing zoo tycoon or wanting a video game all about running a menagerie of animals that focuses on niche areas in the animal care zoo keeping industry this is an absolute must have  its a game that oozes with passion towards simulating a zoo management experience without removing any fun at all everything is extremely customisable from the buildings the climbing enrichment and signage 

the developers are excellent and really take into consideration all the requests for new species and implementing them in a way with a lot of research into intraspecific behaviour and creating a diverse behavioural repertoire for each species i also say that the dlcs for the game are fairly priced and do add a lot of new features and content to the game 

some things that i feel fair to critique is mostly with animal locomotion in the game as it can be quite glitchy sometimes you might see an animal especially climbing animals doing a michael jackson moonwalking on the climbing frames or climbing in mid air hopefully one day they may fix this i am not a programmer so i cannot say too much on how they can improve this 
on some systems especially like my own which is over eight years old the game has quite a struggle to run on which with my system especially i notice a lot that the textures on the animals really degrade over time i really hope frontier fixes this specific issue one day and as an overall i hope that they have some time to focus on optimising the game on all systems as this game is frankly a revolutionary title in the tycoon genre of video games 

thank you so much frontier for making such an amazing game that i can see myself playing for the rest of my life

god im so autistic

#####

march 2 2020 update some issues are fixed  however there are issues i did not address in this review ill change this to positive once all issues are addressed

i am on my 122nd hour of playing this game ive watched around 50 hours of tutorials and game play on youtube
im extremely sad to report that i do not recommend this game at this time i think with a lot of work and balancing this could be the best zoo game that has ever been produced however i have encountered so many problems and frustrations that i just cannot justify a good review
ill start with the positives the graphics are gorgeous any other review will have told you that by now if you have a higher end computer you will really enjoy the look of this game the customization is amazing if it worked right i cant think of a more fun concept than running a zoo and if this game worked as intended it would be a magical time sink that you would never regret

what has stopped me from enjoying this game 

1 the path laying system is ridiculous i have had many path laying encounters that were so frustrating that i had to sit back sigh and try to collect myself imagine you are laying a path straight for many yards you do not re situate your mouse the path suddenly turns right you try to make the path go back to straight as there is nothing around it that should be affecting it or making it turn it will not return to straight you struggle for five minutes before finally restarting the game the path now goes straight this is every path laying experience you will have in this game 
2 balancing the financial aspect of this game is mind numbing ever want to be an accountant good you are one now get ready to pour all your time into balancing finances so you dont go bankrupt your finances are extremely touchy and finicky ive found myself pouring an extreme amount of time into trying not to go bankrupt instead of enjoying building habitats or enjoying animals at the end of a few hours of playing i have felt like a very stressed out accountant many times 
3 keepers do not do their jobs i have done many many experiments where i have fully trained keepers assigned to specific habitats their keeper huts and staff rooms are right next to their assigned habitat the habitat is perfectly set up for the keeper to assist the animals yet i constantly get notifications that the animals are hungry thirsty in peril or starving to death i have been a slave to these notifications and tended them like a hawk my animals have still starved to death for no apparent reason on several occasions this summons protesters protesters make guests unhappy ticket sales drop bam youre bankrupt
4 you constantly face an avalanche of notifications this is worse if you grow weary of the slow regular pace of the game and speed the game up to 2x are your animals hungry thirsty starving are their walls deteriorating did you think you hired someone to take care of all those things sorry nobody does their jobs and you have to manually summon someone to each and every problem that arises so often that you will have an incredibly difficult time carrying out any other tasks other than babysitting notifications if your game is not paused 
5 caretakers do not pick up garbage ive tried everything the garbage just does not stop and effects your guests happiness so much that it can take your zoo under ive tried hiring many caretakers or just a few ive tried training them up or leaving them untrained ive tried assigning them to work zones or leaving them to roam free and caretake as they see fit the caretakers have appropriately placed facilities ive placed trash cans every five feet my zoo is still full of garbage all the time which in turn makes my guests unhappy which drives ticket sales down which you guessed it is just another contributing factor to bankruptcy 
6 guests are unhappy for no reason look i get that in life youre going to have unhappy customers no matter how magical your establishment is whether it be a restaurant or a zoo youre always going to have someone complaining about something arbitrary but the level in which you have to rise to in order to make your guests happy in this game is completely over the top first off you have to place bathrooms garbage cans food and drink literally every five feet or their happiness rating drops from being hungry or thirsty these facilities are hard to maintain given the extremely wack and out of order finances system trying to make them happy is a great way to go bankrupt ive had years in this game where i managed to keep things somewhat under control had a five star rating had all the guests happiness levels stay in the green for the majority of the year and still had thirty thousand dollars of ticket refunds on my books with no other explanation other than unhappy with visit they are also never satisfied with the view of the animals in the habitats just spent a good hour and a half building a beautiful wolf habitat with views from every angle a bridge and everything under the sun your guests could possibly want great prepare for crushing heartbreak as you click on all your guests that are standing literally two feet from an animal complaining that the view of the animal is not so great repeat with every habitat you make even pulling out every tutorial and trick in the book pulling your hair out by now meh take a break go watch youtubers pull their hair out trying to play this game or find the select few that have studied this game like neuroscience in order to get things right and those people still have trouble as well
7 vendors do what they want meet the true gangsters of planet zoo vendors they dont care you can have a fully trained up staff assign them to the shop you want them to tend and you will inevitably find them tending another shop so you scratch that and decide to make the cluster of shops into a work zone and assign the vendors to that work zone this almost works but they will leave one of the shops unattended for so long that you get yet another awesome notification that you cant fix because your staff is idk drunk btw while dealing with this one of your flamingos starved to death you monster 
8 animals eat you out of house and home i once had a 137 year old zoo we were profitable i was putting in an asian wing and decided a giant panda was the first addition to that wing that panda literally ate so much bamboo that i had to close that zoo and start over that was literally the only change i made between flourishing and being bankrupt one panda animals often eat thousands of dollars worth of food which you are not warned about prior to purchasing them there is no upkeep quote no rhyme or reason to how much their food costs its just an unwelcome surprise in fact this is one of the things i have had the most trouble with one year my books show my food cost is 90000 the next year my food cost is 1300000 how much bamboo do you need man 
9 building custom areas facilities or decorations is a nightmare thats right another struggle rather than try to explain this i suggest you try it yourself or look up videos about how to use this games building features theres really not a lot to say other than nothing does exactly what you want it to what you think it should do or what it was meant to trying to get two pieces to snap together that were made to snap together no way trying to move one object no sorry its in a group of objects that have to move together even though you did not specify that its a headache and if it was a person i would duel it to the death

final thoughts do i have more to say yes do i have room no i studied this game harder than some of my surgical tech classes i bought leopard print sheets as hype for this game unbreak my heart make it right

okay heres the thing this game is a jewel in the rough

b its absolutely astonishing how beautiful and thoughtful this game is the models the things you can do the challenges the diversity its fantastic b
 i really get a feel of joy and accomplishment every time i see one of my enclosures doing well when my animals are happy or when things work as theyre supposed to 
 the game shines at its management options and as a biology teacher myself the focus on education and conservation strategies are well thought of 
 the game also offers a good amount of challenges as you progress  i liked that to achieve gold you really need to plan ahead of time 
 the things you are able to do in the animal subject are incredible you can improve their lives by researching their habits and biology including disease prevention and treatment unlocking new possibilities to play with
 contrary to planet coaster a game i absolutely hated this game has a nice tutorial the user interface isnt a complete mess and guess what the game is actually fun to play and to explore the possibilites also there are a lot of game modes to try it out if the campaign isnt your goal
 i loved the inspector its a minichallenge inside the game itself that i absolutely enjoyed

b but not everything is as good as it looks b
 awfully optimized the game stutters quite a bit and ive experienced a few crashes myself
 the game controls are utter garbage completely broken the game simply cant decide when its time to drag and drop or if to place something itll use grid placement or not if to select an enclosure itll be click or double click or nothing if the objects are being placed following terrain or not objects can levitate as it seems the camera is fast or slow as the game decides itll be
 the path placement in this game is truly horrendous suddenly general controls you learned until now dont apply to path placement at all  i must also mention the fact that the game simply hides certain settings to you so theres no clue what to do
 time ingame passes ridiculously fast you build one or two enclosures and bang its the middle of year two you accomplished almost nothing you dont even have time to enjoy certain aspects of gameplay as time goes by so fast
 it looks like everything goes wrong because the game wants to go wrong you build an awesome enclosure the animals are mega happy and then outta nowhere you start receiving notifications every second that the same animals are unhappy because of social issues when absolutely nothing changed from minutes ago the game doesnt even explain whats wrong you have to guess
 the dlcs are overpriced for what they offer sure its awesome to have new 5 species that could be a lot more significant at your zoo and some bricks and things to add and theres that 
 sometimes staff employees do whatever they want whenever they want deal with it

to be fair i completely understand if the negative points turn you off but as for me the game still manages to be fun and engaging even with these broken mechanics i recommend doing things while the game is paused so you can enjoy building and managing without being spammed constantly about nonsensical issues or feeling overwhelmed as time ingame passes stupidly quick

#####

even though my review is positive i would rather give it a meh or unsure ranking but since steams review system is binary ill go with positive

this game is the antizoo tycoon it succeeds at being the polar opposite to the microsoft franchise in all the good and bad aspects this game gives the player the power to truly shape and create the zoo of their dreams at least regarding layout and architecture the creation tools are diverse and powerful letting you use every single object at your disposal like a box of legos and go crazy with it the attention to detail is impressive and the models used for the animals are jaw dropping the gameplay goes more indepth in regards of giving your animals welfare inside their exhibits with mechanics such as temperature fence size food quality and social structure youre also encouraged to breed endangered animals to get special credits to get even rarer species for your zoo

that said all the game has for building and species realism it lacks in diversity and accessibility the controls are clunky and learning to build your own stuff has a steep learning curve unlike zoo tycoon theres no drag and drop wall and path building which means even making your own fences and roads is a clunky experience theres no real tutorial on how to customize buildings meaning the players have to read the ingame documentation to get started on some of the simplest stuff or watch youtube tutorials for it the base game also has very few animals and the set pieces are quite similar to each other meaning unless youre a building pro most of your zoos will end up looking similar the expansion packs are very focused on giving the players new building pieces for their zoo but each only gives 5 extra animals meaning that we have an underwhelming ammount of fauna when compared to even zoo tycoon 3 and the small exhibit animals are pretty much just tiny idle models that just stand there and are hard to be seen inside their enclosures

the level of interactivity with your animals and the park itself is also minimal whereas zoo tycoon lets you see your own zoo through the eyes of a guest or a zookeeper letting you clean and interact with your animals and exhibits here youre limited to be an allseeing eye watching uninteresting visitors and employees doing the same routines over and over having to use the clunky camera controls to get a better view of what youve created

all in all this is certainly a fun game that ive enjoyed but it ironically made me take another look at zoo tycoon 2 and 3 if youre into customizing buildings and exhibits to the smallest detail and making truly amazing zoos give this game a try if you would like to raise a big variety of animals and have a stressfree evening with a user friendly product this aint the game for you give parkasaurus a try or maybe even zoo tycoon 3 which despite the negative reviews on steam is quite actually a good game

#####

i love zoo simulator games with the original zoo tycoon games being my favourite games so i was hoping that i would really enjoy this game too and at times i do however i cant recommend this game

things i liked
the animals look and behave like their real life counterparts the almost limitless customisation lets you design pretty much anything and everything in your zoos franchise mode is such a simple but brilliant concept allowing you to have multiple zoos that are all connected together

now onto the problems

career mode
the missions in career mode all feel the same you either start a new zoo from scratch or are given a preexisting zoo to complete or improve all of the objectives are the same add more animals and improve the zoo rating rinse and repeat
the story in the campaign also makes little sense after your boss bernie is presumed dead on an expedition his franchise is purchased by another man myers who everyone claims does not care about the animals even though he buys terrible zoos and gets you to improve the conditions for the animals then he fires you because hes a bad guy remember and bernies daughter hires you to help her start her own zoo franchise my issue is why do we need the meyers character if bernies daughter is in a position to start her own zoo franchise why didnt she inherit her fathers we could have just skipped meyers out and we would have ended up in the same place

franchise mode animal market
in franchise mode you can buy animals from other players zoos and sell yours to them this is a nice concept but it results in a very slow and unresponsive animal market full of animals with poor genetic stats you will find yourself clicking on the icons in the market up to ten or even twenty times before it selects what you have been clicking meaning that browsing selecting buying and placing an animal in your zoo is infuriatingly time consuming
also why cant i selected multiple habit animals from the animal storage when i can do it in the campaign

conservation credits
firstly most of the species in the game can only be purchased with credits i might understand if it was exclusive for some of the rarer and more critically endangered species but it doesnt in fact the games only domesticated species the bactrian camel can only be purchased with conservation credits or at least i have only ever seen them for sale with credits
secondly you will need loads of conservation credits to buy many of these animals whilst some only require maybe one or two hundred credits many of the species will require several thousand credits this is especially problematic when trying to purchase a social species such as the western lowland gorilla or the indian elephant you therefore are forced to sit for ages waiting to build up enough credits which leads to my final issue
thirdly it takes forever to earn enough credits to purchase many of the species in the game you will earn most of your credits by releasing animals into the wild but most of the animals which you will have early on in your zoos dont provide many credits additionally the number of credits you earn for each animal doesnt seem to be consistent across the species the game indicates that the main factors that influence the credits you earn through releases are remaining lifespan remaining fertility fertility gene and conservation status yet when i released an aardvark and an african wild dog with similar remaining lifespan fertility and fertility gene stats i earned more credits from releasing the aardvark than the wild dog even though the african wild dog is an endangered species and the aardvark is not also why can i not release exhibit animals into the wild in franchise mode when i can do it in the campaign they dont produce many conservation credits anyway so why restrict the players in this way again

micromanagement
it makes sense in a business simulator to have micromanagement however when your micromanagement takes over the rest of the game to such an extent that you spend more time scrolling through different menus than you do in the actual zoo i begin to have an issue with it i want to enjoy watching my animals and work on my zoo but im forced to go through the different menus so frequently that i dont actually get to enjoy my zoo

other issues
why can i not turn off the daynight cycle in franchise mode it is not in sync with the passage of time in the game and at night it is too dark to see anything even with your light switched on so youre just sitting around waiting for it to turn to day again why is there no minimap to jump from one part of your zoo to the other why is the path placement so awkward its impossible to design little food courts or eateries because of the finicky path placement but it doesnt matter as the guests almost never sit down anyway why can i release animals directly from the animal menu but i cant do the same if i want to trade them i have to send them to the trade centre first and then trade them a step that is unnecessary and time consuming why are there only seven challenges in franchisechallenge mode why cant more than one keeper visit a habitat at a time why do animals that require climbing space sometimes not register that there are climbable items in their habitat why does the server disconnect every twenty minutes even though my internet connection is fine and why can i not actually walk around my zoo and interact with my animals and environment it is so infuriating how this game is so inferior to games that came out over ten years ago

the developers
since the game was released frontier has released multiple updates that patch many of the games issues some people think that this is great as frontier is listening to the players feedback which is true but it is also worrying that they are having to patch this game so much and so frequently just like with jurassic world evolution the big patch updates show how unfinished this game is and how frontier has the attitude of selling a game first and finishing later not to mention it has taken them months to getting round to fixing some of the gamebreaking issues yet they had their first dlc pack ready less than a month after release that suggests that they cut content out of the game to sell to players later the fact that frontier has continued with this attitude since jurassic world evolution has discouraged me from wanting to buy any more of frontiers games

conclusion
whilst i can find enjoyment playing this game there are too many factors that are working against it a dull and repetitive campaign bland challenges a broken marketplace overreliance on micromanagement missing or unfinished game mechanics that were perfected in games over a decade ago a currency that restricts what you can put in your zoos and frontier continuing their trend of completing the game after youve bought it and selling the rest of the game bit by bit
if you really want to get this game id say wait a year or two they might have finished it by then

#####

you can tell how much passion the developers put into this game they listen to their community with every update this game gets even better

ive put almost 500 hours into this game and im not even close to finishing it

#####

summary of my first hour of gameplay
 start new zoo
 build enclosure
 adopt lions
 put lions in enclosure
 lions attract tons of people
 lions dont like the enclosure
 lions break out and eat like half of the guests
 start new zoo

#####

excellent successor to my childhood favorite game zoo tycoon hoping for more aquatic animals soon i am slightly sad that i can no longer pick up individual guests and allow my animals to hunt them for sport but i understand that not being allowed thank you frontier for bringing my beloved zoo tycoon into the modern age

#####

planet zoo has some issues  its a resource hog dlc packs are too expensive for what you get there are lots of problems with path placement and the ui is a bit clunky in places it can also be intimidating because of the freedom it allows  you really can build just about anything you can think of and that can be paralyzing sometimes

but if your pc will run it and you like animal and zoo management you simply cant do any better than this when it works its truly astounding check youtube for about 10000000 gameplay videos if youre looking for ideas or want to see some of the amazing creations that can be constructed in the game

#####

planet zoo is a great game i love just playing it in the background whilst chatting with friends i also really appreciate the effort the devs have put into listening to the community and continually adding new features requested by players i really recommend

#####

very good purchase at least if on sale most of the dlcs also highly recommended graphics and the zoo building and decorating aspects are amazing management and learning about animals are very okay too but once you get your cash flow running it will continue to grow and so the gameplay might get a bit dull 
still with all one of my favourite games suitable for many different purposes of gaming

#####

i would like this much more if escaped animals actually attacked the guests

#####

good game but i have absolutely have no idea what im doing im not kidding please help

#####

i like the game overall but finding out that the devs are pushing 10 dlcs on a 60 game thats been out for less than 6 weeks is frustrating definitely shouldnt be paying 60 if dlcs are gonna be so expensive and start happening so quickly after launch

update still never bought the dlcs and having as much fun revisiting this game as when i first bought the replay value remains this game is fantastic if youre looking for park management games and the ability to create your hearts desire youre given a blank slate to terraform and create the zoo you always wanted theres so many rabbit holes to explore within the game giving research and the ability to breed healthier genetics over time youre able to live track your zoos animals and potentially breed better offspring if you match the parents and the exhibit correctly

game is still fun to revisit since last review

#####

it has monke very good 5 stars

#####

how to have fun in this game 

step 1 install

step 2 tutorial

step 3 start a franchise

step 4 make a monke habitat

step 5 put monke in the monke habitat

step 6 profit

#####

this game has what i call sims 4 syndrome in that i forget it exists for a while remember it one day play it nonstop for 19 hours and then forget about it for the next few months

good game tho

#####

best place to relive my zoo tycoon childhood cant wait for the dinosaur expansion

#####

i like deleting the exits and setting the lions loose 

#####

its a relaxing game if you ever want to switch off your head then with this game

#####

half the animals are dlcs

#####

love this game worked my way through the career mode messed around a little and created my first sandbox zoo about 300 hours play time 

pros 
1 endless creativity 
2 animals act as they would in real life and are super cute
3  kinda game you get lost in for hours really is enjoyable 
4 graphics are great even on lower settings  i play on medium 

con
1 over heats laptops when park is large guest numbers high or lots of items where used this isnt too much of an issue for me but deffo will effect low end laptops

afterthought the game is fun and easy to get the hang of however playing it makes you feel like you are being milked it feels like everything cool is locked behind a dlc if you are willing to spend the enormous amount of money required to get all of the dlcs im sure you will have fun


#####

planet zoo is a well designed and detailed zoo tycoon game let me summarise my personal opinions

pros
game play is really nice and smooth the number of animals and the detail of the game play very good 
controls and camera are okay 
career mode is quite nice with lots of challenges and objectives 
huge open space for creativity 
art design is very cosy and somewhat realistic 

cons
it requires a well spec computer especially for zoos with 56k guests
the number of guest visiting your zoo relative to the zoos reputation is not realistic at all also a major problem for fps
it is not a game for competitive players after setting your initial layout up the finance wont be a problem at all 
it is not a cheap game price tag
only four attributes for habitat animals which making the progress quite linear no staff attributes 
operational disruptions eg animal illnesses facility breakdowns can be easily avoided thereby not providing any challenge  
creating paths can sometimes be annoying 
some bugs and crashes 

in summary i recommend this game for casual players it is still worth to buy with full price tag

#####

predatory dlc policies make me  thumbs down i used to purchase every dlc just to support the amazing studio that brought us planet coaster but now they choose to disreward their originalloyal customer base my not allowing bundle purchases when new dlc comes out why can only a newbie take advantage of the pack why am i not allowed to get the bundle discount just because ive supported you from the beginning and for a long time no more

#####

good game but id like an aquarium dlc

#####

this game is a work of art do you like building thats great add some animals into the habitat do you love your animals thats also great until of course their eventual death from several diseases and the extremely large quantities of excrement all over the place as a result of your keepers incompetence enjoy spending hours placing rocks in marginally different directions for aesthetic looks thats cool just dont place them too close to the animals or you will end up with a herd of antelope frantically dashing over the fence into a crowd of guests whom upon realisation that there is a herd of antelope jumping over the fence run towards the exit claiming that i tried to kill them back to the building you might want to create a lovely path surround your habitat to allow your guests the most comfortable experience possible yeah thats not happening pal what will actually happen is you will attempt to create a smooth curved path around the barrier at which point the path will severely divert off course into another habitat and will not connect at all regardless of how much you change length or curvage or connection requirements or the align to surface box because the pathing system in this game is utter poo anyway yeah its a great game 1010 very addictive

#####

im very on the fence with this game i wanted to play a zoo tycoon game but after several hours ive done very little zoo management and more meticulously arranging tiny pieces to create buildings the building in the game is extremely detail oriented which is both a blessing and a curse its cool to be able to create your own shops and habitats but at some point i just get tired of building and a i want to play a game unfortunately outside of building game play is a lot of waiting waiting for research to finish or money to build up the controls lack intuition many of the functional building lack in game descriptions example how many zookeepers a small vs large zookeeper hut can hold and game features are not fully explained i had to watch several tutorials on youtube just to figure out how to get some things to work properly i cant emphasize enough that creating paths is an absolute nightmare and after all that hard work its very likely that if you put too many animals in your zoo it will slow to a crawl and become unplayable i like building games but i like managing resources much more than i do creating virtual dioramas if youre into that sort of thing and i know people are because i have seen beautiful things created in this game please download on a positive note i will say the game is gorgeous and just watching some of the animals in their habitats can be delightful i just wish it was a little more user friendly

#####

at over 1000 hours ive spent a good portion of my time doing little but obsessing over the littlest of details both inside and outside the game though the learning curve can be a steep one overcoming it is the most satisfying feeling in the world

#####

game is absolutely stunning ask anyone the animals are cute as heck the building and terrain tools let you make endless possibilities and everything looks visually great 

i highly recommend this game if you are unsure if you will like it go watch some videos on it and come back its a well rounded game so even if you arent fussed on animals how could you then you can still get some enjoyment out of the management building and challenge aspects of the game

#####

its got animals in it

#####

sit down to build a zoo and suddenly the whole day is gone wtf happened

#####

im not going to lie it was an expensive purchase and i had to think really hard if i really wanted it in the end i decided to get it because because i really enjoyed zoo tycoon 2 as a kid and i wanted something a little more with the modern touch to it after having invested 10 hours into it i am not at all disappointed 

so what makes planet zoo standout from everything else in the same genre out there  there are two answers to this question the first one is animations the animation are just beautiful in planet zoo ive spent good chunk of time just watching the flamingos and peafowls moving around and being all playful every animal has its own routine has its own bunch of stats every animal is dynamic to an extent that it feels as if they are really there in front of you on your screen i think this is something which is really hard to accomplish but theyve done it here and i couldnt be more happy 

the other factor which makes it stand out is the construction aspect you can literally build anything from scratch it does take time but it is there and if you are someone who is creative then i think this is as good as it gets there are already a bunch of blueprints in the workshop waiting for you to download 

another thing which this game does well micromanagement there is lots to do and at times you will be torn apart between all the different things to do and might even not like it but in the long run i feel like this gives you more control over your zoo you can research different animals diseases objects items facilities and such 

to anyone who is on the fence if they should purchase it or not im here to say that you wont be disappointed if you decide to go with it it is expensive i bought it off from fanatical as it was relatively cheaper and i do have an extra 5 off coupon if anyone is interested in that

#####

this game is really great there is almost everything you want to do and make in a zoo but the only things that would make the game even better is a visiting function to visit other peoples zoo and a first person mode to walk through your own zoo or other peoples zoos like a visitor sadly that feature isnt in the game but it is still great game

#####

i care more about my virtual beavers than i do myself

#####

the gameplay is great although there are still things that need fixing if you like management games especially if you like building you will like this if youre a planet coaster player you will love this

however i cant recommend this game right now since the alwaysonline mode franchise server goes down way too often its not my internet its their servers its really annoying that you cant play what to its core is a single player game because frontiers server has problems as soon as they get this fixed i will update the review and recommend the game but right now its not good enough 
if game companies insist on alwaysonline sp games then they darn well gotta make it work first

update there is still a problem with the franchise servers ive played about half an hour and its gone down twice when the server goes down the game pauses and you cant play this is unacceptable for an sp game i love the gameplay but i cant recommend until this is fixed

#####

as an old school zoo tycoon player i loved this  its everything i wanted from the old game and more and sandbox options means you can adjust the play style however you want on top of the difficulty settings

edit i cant express how happy it makes me that the dev team continue to develop the game and provide new content especially content the community asks for

#####


when i first purchased planet coaster i was a teenager addicted to any sort of tycoon game i could get my hands on planet coaster was a fun getaway but i always felt that it was missing something as once you built a section of the map it felt like there was no reason to ever interact with it again planet zoo was one of the best choices they could have made to improve everything planet coaster had been lacking 

ill be frank the game has its moments where it is inevitably frustrating the building components are taxing and can take hours to do even the smallest of buildings if youre detail oriented enough the animals can be unreasonably picky and respond to terrain in bizarre ways guests are understatedly irritable and always have something to complain about even if the zoo is by your standards perfect my biggest pet peeve is when they complain about the view its not my fault the bear is sleeping in its den right now 

but there is so many more positives here that make it way more worthwhile than those small complaints there is a lot more to keep track of however  i feel like this is a major plusside to the games mechanics and causes you to never run out of things to do and explore tracking zookeepers workflow maintaining animal health purchasing enrichment toys and food for the exhibits building up security even making sure the guests dont get too hot there is so much to oversee once you grasp the games components and have a good understanding of how it functions this game is without a doubt absolutely splendid its calming relaxing and so enjoyable to just marvel in the animals behaviors managing a living and breathing zoo at your own pace and your own challenge level has got to be one of the most fun things youll do in a while especially if you already have a deep love for simulation games

there are plenty of things i could nitpick just for the sake of wishing to see improvements but the main message is this this game is beautiful and very fun please if youve been thinking about it get it 

i will put one warning the developers unfortunately dislike mods considering they make income selling their dlcs and so should you ever decide to put in modded animals please make sure to choose mods that are frequently updated and keep on top of updating the files as outofdate files after each ingame update will cause it to crash and fail to load 

beyond that i love it seriously and would recommend it to all my good friends and family and so i recommend it to you

#####

just talked to a guy today who says the game does not become an issue for conservation pointswhat you need to get the good animals becomes easy at around the 1000 played hrs mark so that is the type of grind required that i mention below in the rest of my review

this game is too grindy and now that most of the community is gone the economy is all messed up you cant just get in and start making a zoo with the animals you want some animals you cant even get because they are not sold by anyone for a new person starting out it is a royal pain in the ass since the games community has faded they really should patch out the conservation system or patch it so that you dont require other players to help you out the games breeding system is such that you have to have at least one good parent and if you can  find a player selling one it will cost you a small fortune in conservation points now for established players this is not so bad because they already have rare breeds they are raising and if anything they can just release them to the wild for points but for new peeps you are relegated to animals no one cares about raising endless babies and releasing them to the wild for a pittance rinse and repeat for days and you might have enough to buy one player bred animal that you want sadly it will probably be dead before you get another one to breed with it

#####

ive owned this for a little less than 9 days and ive already played for 63 hours so i think its fair to say that im addicted i got this as a gift so i didnt pay for it myself just to be clear but i do think it would be worth the money 

the graphics are great and i really enjoy the freedom youre given in sandbox mode and how you can build whatever you like however i feel a little bit limited in the other game modes because you first have to research stuff and wait until you can use them i wish there was some way to play with the money limitation but not having to research everything 

i also found the game to be a little bit buggy sometimes especially in franchise mode suddenly the only animal available to buy was aardvarks and we had to refresh over and over and over again until all the other animals were available as usual then i had this issue with my crocodile babies just walking straight through the brick walls

considering how much this game costs i think you could expect these bugs to be fixed already but other than that i dont have anything negative to say about this game i can just play for hours and hours and lose track of time until i realise how much my eyes hurt from staring at a screen its a recommendation from me

#####

pros  
a crap ton of animals to work with all who behave differently and the animals are adorable

the insane amount of creativity you can use while building basically you can make anything as advanced as you want or do it very simply you can spend hours on a simple hut

challenging game modes franshise mode and challenge mode but fun i was afraid the game would be extremely easy but it can be a challenge especially as you start grasping how the game works

animal progression is a bit of a grind but in good and rewarding way you earn conservation credits by selling animals you breed andor release to the wild  these credits are then used to buy other animals some being very expensive but once you manage to get a pack of animals you want its really rewarding and you can then proceed to breed those to continue earning more credits

there is an offline version for people who dont want to play online this is something they added very late in developement which shows that the devs do listen to their player base and fans

steam workshop support is a big deal for a game like this people can upload amazing creations and you can use them in your own parks so if youre someone who isnt creative or dont want to spend time on it you can download some amazing creations to use

after 16 hours i still feel like i learn new things constantlyso if youre someone who likes games that require you to learn over a longer period of time this is for you

cons
the building is very very difficult to understand when you start out especially if you havent played planet coaster like myself it  took me hours to understand how it all worked i would recommend watching some guides on youtube on how to build to grasp it much faster as the tutorial doesnt do a well enough job

performance is quite poor especially as the parks get a lot of guests and it grows during the tutorial this is very apparent i was averaging around 4355 fps on high default this is obviously playable but with an rtx 2070 and a ryzen 5 2600x which is more than above the recommended requirements i would expect a solid 60 fps constantly and its due to optimization as the cpu and gpu rarely go above 50 usage this is mostly apparent at random areas in the parks where the game will drop from 60 down to 25 fps out of no where and its constantly repeated at a certain location in my first park this is something i hope the devs work on

even though the game had a month of beta the game does have some bugs its not bad enough where it breaks the game but some annoyance at times for example when viewing my shops i had a bug where i couldnt view or adjust the prices on the merch and fooddrinks being sold but that was resolved by just reloading the zoo

another common bug is with animations of animals who climb and jump its not terrible but youll notice it if you spend time observing them but im sure the devs are working on that

 another quite annoying thing for me is that the ui scaling that you can do manually which is great for people like me with bad vision isnt really adjusted well you cant really upscale the ui without it blocking things you need to click on and to open tabs

conclusion

if you enjoyed playing a former zoo game that shall remain nameless yes that one you will love this one planet zoo gives you everything you want in a zoo game and more  the level of detail and freedom they give the player is tremendous i can only see the game get better from here i would give this an 8510 it would be a 9 if it wasnt due to the minor bugs and path placement building being so hard to learn

apologize in advance for any spelling errors

to fronteir
thank you for the work you put in it to this and filling a need a lot of us had forgotten we needed the game is really good and i hope you work on these things
1 pathing is way too complex and not responsive enough same goes for placing objects like trash bins
2 climbing animations are quite wonky and can ruin the immersion
3 give us the abillity to move more than one animal from storage at a time by shift clicking on them for some reason this was something you could do in the tutorial but not in franchise mode feels odd to remove it
4 put a limit on how much people can ask for an animal asking multiple thousand for a warthog when you can buy one for 40 credits thats just as good feels strange maybe do something where depending on the stats of the specific animal genetics impact how high of a number you can ask for for example a warthog whos got perfect genetics can only be set at 300 where as an average one can only be 100

i like th4e giraf

dear planet zoo devloper is it possible in a future update to add a feature where you can play or control as any animal in the game and controle your staff  play as them i would really enjoy such feature in a future update 

ps this game is amazing

#####

pretty awesome sim game managing a zoo or franchise can be very addicting the graphics look great and i love how nicely done the animals are they roam around doing lots of interesting things and will utilize things you place in their habitats

the mechanics seem pretty deep though some are a bit vague on exactly what the problem is there is a good bit of trial and error to the learning process but its easy to generate a profit once you get the hang of it

the games biggest weakness is its building system there are tons of options and being able to assemble your own blueprints is awesome but between the bugs and path issues it can be a real pain to deal with some times

#####

fun buildazoo game with good looking animals and a lot of customization

pros

 lots of animal variety 
 good looking animal variety
 tons of customization to build the zoo you want
 focus on education and helping wild populations with your zoo
 steam workshop for those who dont like to build for themselves

cons

 humans look weird
 no aquariums aviaries
 lots of repeat animals in dlcs instead of new unique species that could be used


#####

i am a little hesitant to give this game a thumbs up not because it is bad its a very good and addicting game there are though some bugs and slow downs and some other problems within the game that need to be ironed out 

h1the badh1
franchise mode is one of the best modes in the game but the servers have slow down issues and accuracy issues this means that it can be difficult to trade animals with other players and keep track of the value of those animals

at the moment theres no way to list your animals by their review ratings this would be a helpful feature

theres also no way to automate releasing animals to the wild or selling them the reason this is a problem is that some species reproduce like crazy and result in a constant micromanagement of keeping their populations at healthy levels

the game has some bad launching issues often times it freezes on my first attempt to launch the game for others it is a worse problem from what i have seen in the discussion section usually restarting the game fixes it for me but it would be nice to just launch and play instead of having to launch close launch

h1the goodh1
holy crap you can customize every little thing if you enjoyed planet coaster its very similar and just as enjoyable though i would argue it is made more so by the fact that you are caring for the animals

the animals look amazing and their animations are awesome its a lot of fun just watching them sometimes

franchise mode is so cool building multiple zoos sharing animals between them and interacting in a semi non direct way with the community at large the community goals can be fun and the game mode is super addicting

h1conclusionh1
the game has a couple edges that are a bit torn and rough and need some work but overall its a very enjoyable experience i am very happy with the money i spent on the game i have a ton of fun trying to improve the look and feel of my habitats and trying to improve the lives of my animals i love making my zoo look realistic and trying to think of new ways to improve it

i am honestly looking forward to expansions already and i havent even scratched the surface of the base game

had a delicious burger at chief beef although the wife seems to think it isnt real meat luckily the children loved seeing the pandas so the day was saved too many lemurs in the lemur enclosure though surely it cant be good for them all in all a great day at the zoo even if the reptile house stinks and the ceiling was leaking 1010 would zoo again

#####

bought it and cant stop thinking of terraforming

played 42 hours within 10 days that has only happened to me 3 times in the last 15 years on steam

im honestly doing it for my wife who hates games but loves animals and this game and our baby sheep gets us closer together

1010

ps luv u hun

you make a zoo

#####

has a bit of a learning curve more difficult than say zoo tycoon but in place of that it has complexity and enjoyable indepth gameplay theres a lot of room to make a custom zoo just the way you like with lots of options and also special requirements for certain species the graphics for the animals are great and things are welldesigned
1010 for me as an original zoo tycoon fan

amazing game the creative freedom is amazing i find myself starting a new zoo just to try different things the game has had its issues but frontier have done a cracking job listening to the community an update 11 is a prime example of this fact buy this game ive clocked 300 plus hours an ive not even used half the base game animals i highly rate this game

#####

a couple things about this game that i have experienced so far first the concept of the game is super fun espicially if you  enjoy playing other simulation like zoo tycoon or roller coaster tycoon you can take on the challenge of franchise mode where you need to keep in mind your finances welfare of animals staff as well as researching so you can unlock more items to build and more toys for your animals etc if you do not want the extra challenge of all that you can play the less stressful sandbox mode where you can build your dream zoo how you aspire the game is super in depth the habitats you can build in this game are pretty crazy and is only limited to your ability in using the editor with that being said the editor has several problems in itself that i will get to later the financing in this game is very detailed and you can lose money very fast if youre not paying much attention but after a couple failed zoos you will quickly learn the functions of the game and begin to make some very profitable zoos overall the concept of the game is super fun and i have had a great time playing so far 

now lets talk about some of the problems and annoyances i find with this game first off lets start with the pathing system the pathing system in this game makes me want to quit path do not follow a grid and will auto connect to other paths when they too close this seems like a great function but when you are trying to get super detailed with your habitats and buildings the pathing can screw with you so much the paths will auto connect when you dont want them to paths wont place where you want them to and overall they can make your zoo look like crap and they will get you frustrated frequently its extremely frustrating after you spend a good couple hours making a viewing area for your habitat and then the pathing just says nope and you really cant do much about it 
second annoyance with this game is the construction system its hard to explain until you have used it and understand how it works in short nothing lines up correctly you will spend hours on this game just lining up walls to the best of your ability with your mouse your walls will start to clip into each other displaying weird texture glitches but its the only way to design cool buildings that look like they fit in your zoo now i know about the grid feature that is implemented but the grid feature doesnt work at all with the path system so if you are placing multiple walls they will start to stray away or collide with your path its faster to ignore the grid feature and place each wall and roof individually and line them up perfectly it takes a ton of time to do small construction projects in your zoo 
third annoyance maintenance the bigger your zoo gets the more of a problem this becomes you have to keep up with maintaining your zoo are your animal welfare and guest happiness will plummet like i mentioned this is not that big of a deal at first but once you expand and have a couple of habitats and exhibits throughout your zoo youll notice what i am talking about exhibit animals will give mass birth and its hard to keep up youll start a new project and next thing you know you are getting an alert that there are 15 eastern brown snakes in your exhibit and there welfare is now at 0 next thing you know you have 50 protesters coming through the entrance of your zoo protesting animal welfare this is just one of the many many many maintenance problems that will occur throughout you zoo others being enrichment toys getting old habitat barriers breaking even though staff is assigned to that habitat too much litter on the ground animals getting stressed out protesters and more it gets to a point that at times you find yourself not being able to expand because your so caught up in maintaining what you already have
last annoyance i have found with this game the amount of money you start out with seems too small and hers why when you start a new zoo you get 40000 which isnt that small of an amount but heres the problem with it you are forced to build a small zoo to start off staff buildings a drink and food stand bathroom information center and maybe one habitat or a couple of small exhibits with staff members to run it all  you cant build much and most of it is required facilities once you get this small zoo up and profitable you can expand more and after a lot of hours into this zoo youll come to notice that the entrance to your zoo doesnt match everything else you were forced to build small habitats due to money and you had no research done so the theme doesnt match the rest of your zoo it makes the zoo look awfully weird and for me it made me lose motivation to play the game you put a lot of hours into this one zoo and then you zoom out and it just looks so weird and not like how you imagined it in your head
overall though the game has a super fun concept and i am sure ill continue to play for a little longer for people deciding if they should purchase the game just know this 1 its super tedious and it will take a long time to learn the controls and mechanics 2 you need to be patient with the game you will fail a couple of zoos before making a successful one it takes time 3 you will get frustrated at times as mentioned above there are flaws with the game its not perfect 4 its super in depth compared to other simulation sandbox type games and you should do the tutorial and read the help  tips when one pops up if you decide to buy the game i hope you have fun d overall i enjoyed the game and yes i recommend it but only to certain people

#####

if you loved zoo tycoon when you were younger this is even better

#####

its got animals its got plants its got rocks its got my attention

#####

i absolutely adore this game and can absolutely recommend it yes ive had a few issues and the game can be quite challenging but nothing has been gamebreaking for me and im thoroughly enjoying the different aspects of it

the graphics the animals and their movement and sounds the freedom and flexibility and the creativity you can use to map out a new zoo from scratch are fantastic once you thoroughly understand what animals and guests need great tutorials its not so tough anymore to make a profitable and wellbalanced zoo ive made 2 now in franchise mode and both are running smoothly with plenty of cash and animals including some critically endangered 

start up small and modest and build up your zoo slowly and gradually focus on animal and guest needs and happiness i havent had to take out a loan and have plenty of cash although i did have a rough period for a while due to an issue described below some of the process can be challenging and there certainly is some micromanagement involved but its very rewarding and satisfying to not only see your animals thrive but also see guests appreciating all the hard work you put in it doesnt get boring you unlock new building styles transportation etc to keep your zoo looking fresh and stunning

some of the issues and regularly brought up complaints i would like to address here for me they have not impacted my overall love of this game but i do want to put my 2 cents in in my opinion yes  some of the issues are bugs that frontier has fixed already or is working on but other issues are due to people including me not fully understanding some of the game mechanics my experience with frontier after submitting 2 bug reports is very positive  they reacted very quickly and resolved any issues ive had  great customer service

1 i had a bug where my game would crash every time i clicked on the inspector icon i submitted a bug report and when the next patch came out 1 day later this was fixed also it didnt ruin my game anyway cause i could continue playing as long as i didnt click that icon so annoying yes but its not like i lost any game data or save files or heaven forbid animals and it was fixed very quickly

2 the issue with keepers not filling up food bowls so animals get hungry or even starve i experienced this in the beta and in the final game this is no longer a real issue for me get a clear understanding of how the process works there are plenty of threads on that by now and you should be ok however i do still get the odd animal not eating when there is food in front of its adorable yet ignorant face or keepers not filling up the food bowls fast enough for whatever reason i run 2 big zoos after all  but  as soon as you see that warning come up you can put the animal in a quarantine or trade center with 1 click there the animal will not age or die and when after a while i get the update that the quarantine has passed and i release the still hungry animal to its habitat there will be plenty of food again and the animal will eat so it can be a bit tricky and you have to watch out for the warnings and you will get protesters while the animal is in danger but i have not lost any animals to this is this a bug or intended to be a challenging mechanic i dont know but it doesnt matter as i can work around it
its not perfect ive had animals stuck and as soon as you move them theyre fine again ive had 2 keepers and 2 mechanics running in the same spot while all animals in 1 habitat were hungry until i deleted the path they were on and put a new path down and everything worked fine again

3 ive had a warning that a vet couldnt find a staff room with space when in fact there were 3 unused staff rooms i decided to fire her cause if she cant find an available spot shes too ignorant to work in my zoo but a bit later i noticed in the staff overview that her status was cannot leave the zoo or something some guests were also trapped reload your game and it works fine

4 i cannot find the animals i want to buy or theyre soooo expensive on the market  yes lots of animals are ridiculously overpriced by other greedy players dont buy and you will not be able to get every type of animal you want right away but there is no lack of new animals being put into the market including critically endangered that you can buy for normal cash or conservation credits  you will not be able to release animals bought with cash into the wild later but theyre great to get started no shortage at all hit the refresh button in the animal market check every now and then and if you see something you like reel it in and keep it in storage until you find a mate or enough peers to put them in a habitat plenty of choice no need to go for perfect stat animals ive experienced that with advanced research and also improving animal nutrition and general wellness you can breed really nice great animals with huge appeal ive bred a few albino star animals including a very cute albino ringtailed lemur 

5 guest happiness is crucial my zoo was making lots of money but all of a sudden i was losing more than i was making i went from over 350k cash to 140k in a few months my guests seemed happy my animals were in great shape and i hadnt changed the way i was running things so i couldnt understand what was going on or how to save my zoo in the finance tab i saw that this was down to refunds that had increased to insane levels  i lost more money on this than i was investing in animal food in total there was nothing on this in the help section and very little on any forum so i submitted an issue report while i stopped playing this particular zoo to prevent bankruptcy frontier reacted very quickly same day and we sent some save files for them to check within a few hours frontier explained that this was down to guests being very unhappy and demanding refunds and the reason the guests were so unhappy was overlapping educational speakers these speakers help educate people about animals and have a certain influence radius and fulfill guests educational needs if 2 speakers overlap however the guests get so angry they leave the zoo and demand refunds really all i did then was remove 4 or 5 speakers and my zoo got profitable again immediately yes its ridiculous that this could be such an issue without any real info on it in the game itself but my main point here is that frontier acted immediately and gave us feedback on this issue right away check the happiness of your guests with the heat map filter and once you understand the mechanics you know what to focus on

ive spent too much time on these issues just to be clear i love this game it looks feels and sounds fantastic and i have confidence that should any bugs or problems occur frontier will deal with these quickly

update 1 year later and im still loving the game its fantastic yes there is a learning curve and you will need time to fully understand what youre doing but once you really get going its guaranteed hours of fun expansion packs are nice and add new content to keep things looking fresh still recommend it

all i can say is dont buy the game yet because the servers are just not ready
its been 8 hours on and off mostly off it is impossible to play the franchise mode which is the real deal 
what i dont get is the game could just let you play the franchise mode while you are offline but not let you use the trading option as soon as youre back online again it could simply let you use the trading again i just dont get that they couldnt think of this or any other solution instead they just let us down

2019 unacceptable

update 
 they tried numerous patches but the animal trading market still needs around 1000 clicks to do basically anything 
 the game still crashes non stop in fact now it seems to happen more often
 im running the game with rtx2080 ti and 9900k 6k visitors didnt even use 30 of the map huge lags i basically need to restart the game every 10 mins now

update 21st november 2019
 well i am still playing the game just because i love the architectural aspect of it and the freedom to build different habitats
 yet it feels like i am losing interest at this point as the game keeps crashing every 10 minutes i keep sending crash reports but im pretty sure nobody gives a s
 my wife has different issues she gets disconnected every 5 minutes from the franchise servers 
 my staff especially keepers get teleported into the middle of nowhere looking for staff rooms the notification pops up for a glimpse of a second you gotta be really fast to click it and save the staff from dying of thirst in the middle of the desert

solid game takes me away from the blood boiling rage i experience on tarkov i think this game might actually lower my blood pressure

#####

animal game i love animal

its so sad the best animals are behind dlc the foxes are the best

#####

its a fun game that ive spent tons of hours playing  i love being able to build the environments throughout the zoo as well as managing the animals  my only problem is that for all the money i put into the game i cant even get all of the missing dlcs in a complete package with the added 15 discount  essentially i paid for the game in full with a few of the dlcs and instead of rewarding me for completing my purchase of the newer dlcs im penalized because i didnt wait until all the dlcs came out before purchasing them all  kinda crappy if you think about it  most people playing have at least the base game and they cant even benefit from a package like that

very fun time wasting game

do you love animals this is the perfect game for you

why i think ive already spent enough hours playing this game to be able to relate to it i am ready 

starting from the very beginning  frontier have created a real miracle and once again proved after the great planet coaster that they know how to create colorful cheerful and charming simulators like no one else from the very first seconds after launching our first virtual zoo we are attacked with vivid colors and cheerful music that you simply cannot dislike

the graphic design itself is at a really high level in most cases simulators of this type in which we have thousands of moving objects such as guests animals employees etc you forgive much more in terms of graphics in this case however the creators did something amazing graphically planet zoo looks just amazing all sorts of details that we are able to see by watching the animals cheerfully moving guests around our zoo and thousands of individual animations for each species  nothing but sit comfortably on the couch and watch our little zebras run happily on their enclosure pushing each other around and having fun with an inflated ball

moving on to what is most important of course  animals the game is constantly evolving offering us more and more new species more or less willing to live in our zoo and why more or less each creature has its own individual character traits that depend not only on the species itself and its preferences but also on the parents preferences so for example assuming that both parents are albinos or had albino specimens in their family there is a greater chance that our new tiny cuddly will also be born albino if both parents have the longevity gene there is a good chance that their offspring will also have one amazing and very interesting in addition of course there is an adaptation of individual species to the conditions in the zoo polar bears will not feel best in the african climate unless we take care to adjust the climate and temperature to their loved ones in addition some species of animals are much less resistant to stress so in this case we should take care of carefully securing their enclosure and providing them with many shelters where if necessary they can hide from the eyes of visitors

the game has as befits a simulator a really large number of indicators to control starting from the basic ones such as hunger general wellbeing or satisfaction with our pupils to more advanced ones such as the quality of the food served appropriate vegetation for a given species the need to associate with other species from their native sites or the appropriate population and sexual division most species do not tolerate when there is more than one male in a herd

due to the fact that it is an advanced simulator of running your own zoo it had to be equipped with a large number of different species of animals from around the world only in the basic version of the game we are talking about as many as 50 different genres which is a really impressive number considering the degree of mapping behavior or individual features for each genre that have been directly implemented into the game each animal has its own personality traits and a different degree of for example fertility which for obvious reasons affects the ease  difficulty of reproducing in addition the basic version of the game also includes 23 species of exhibit animals every with different terrarium air humidity temperature and decor needs

in the game we can use readymade decor variants such as themed buildings or enclosure designs but we also have the opportunity to create our own style from scratch thanks to the advanced editor the only thing that limits us is our own imagination and as if that was not enough  after creating a beautiful enclosure for our hippos we have the opportunity to share it in the steam workshop thanks to other players will be able to use our work and we can draw inspiration from there

an additional advantage is the biweekly events that involve the release of a certain number of animals into the wild adopted or sold them by the entire planet zoo community and if we manage to achieve it within a certain time we will receive unique rewards

to conclude  planet zoo is a complete simulator and the enormity of options available directly in the game means that we will never be bored and we always have our hands full from the very beginning when our zoo has only a few species of animals i definitely recommend it to all fans of simulators and not only because due to the enormous amount of work and constant updates the game is simply excellent and will provide a lot of fun for hundreds of hours

#####

i hate to be so negative about developers whose work ive loved since my childhood but unfortunately i cant name a single mechanic in this game that is thoroughly enjoyable

the basis for many of my complaints can be traced back to the way the games noncommittal use of grid systems paths can be placed on grids buildings can be built on grids ride stations fit into grids but despite being the same size grid every time there is no way to make any of these constructions share a grid paths and rides can never connect to buildings and buildings can never connect to paths or rides habitat walls can also be built to snap to angles meaning you can build a habitat in a grid in some sense but there is no way to make this grid line up to any other plus if you want the ride to enter a habitat you must build the habitat and gates first itheni build the ride to pass through them you cannot build the ride first and then build the habitat around it

the inability to build things carefully together suggests that youre meant to build larger and more natural zoos but so many other aspects of the game suggest otherwise every single career level shows you zoos that are built tightly compact with multiple levels explicitly challenging you to build tightly and many even having buildings with paths built through them and aside from that larger zoos are bad for many gameplay reasons more walking for both guests and staff which makes both of them unhappy and also necessitates building more facilities lest your guests urinate themselves or your animals starve waiting for a meal to travel miles

the game is also needlessly dense with mechanics im specifically referring to the ones that seem to be chasing realism such as the mechanic where animals get bored of toys in their enclosure after some time and the game suggests you remove them for a time and then place them back in that level of micromanagement is to be blunt extraordinarily tedious even if you have literally one animal as soon as you have multiple especially ones with different habitat items its utterly ludicrous that this would be a mechanic another feature in the halfbaked realm is researching to unlock new themes there are a tiny handful of cosmetic construction tilesets which to emphasize are completely cosmetic there is no gameplay reason to research them they dont provide any bonuses that your default tileset doesnt have and yet the game asks you to choose between researching them or researching many of the actually important things like ecofriendly power sources or new guest facilities even worse each of these options has four research levels with each level after the first one just providing blueprints  they literally only save the player the convenience of designing their own building and if you find that helpful youre still going to research the climbing frames instead because theres actually a gameplay reason to to compare to rct3 again that game had far more scenery themes to choose from and they werent locked behind such a mechanic and while it doesnt deserve a whole paragraph its a strange decision to not allow the player to have multiple interface windows open especially for how often youll want to crossreference zoopedia information to set up your habitats and exhibits correctly its a curious decision indeed to not allow you to have for example the exhibit settings and the zoopedia open simultaneously once again rct3 let you have pretty much as many interface windows open as you needed

all of these complaints about mechanics are only exacerbated by the games tutorial which is truly impressive in how little it actually teaches you while it does teach you some of the absolute basic mechanics theres still a huge amount that it doesnt much of which becomes important in later levels for example it doesnt introduce you to the childishlooking education items that are actually surprisingly useful nor does it ever suggest that the security items you can place are anything more than cosmetic theres an entire security overlay that nothing in the game will ever prompt you to open some of the mechanics the tutorial leaves out are still seemingly obtuse to the playerbase the game has a system that rates animals out of 5 stars and theres a lot of conflicting information about how to actually achieve that on a separate note it would be really helpful to sort the zoopedia by well anything at all  for example sorting by which animals need the least space to figure out what fits in the corner of your zoo or filtering to animals where your guests can enter the habitat or sorting by temperature so you know what animals are suited to your zoos environment

and for all my complaining so far i have yet to comment on things that are actually just broken transport rides top the list which is shocking considering that the developers previous game was planet coaster for whatever reason riders will not disembark a ride until they reach the front of the station no matter how big the station is this creates a problem if there arent more people entering the ride because then empty cars will block your riders from disembarking theres an option for your station to prioritize incoming riders and so empty cars will be sent out to make space but this then overrides anyone who actually is queueing for the ride this issue can spiral into causing a wave of guests to leave your zoo and demand refunds bankrupting you in the span of seconds and convincing you to never bother with transport rides again the terrain tools are the next major source of frustration and its a hundred small things that add up paths have a tunneling option which will let them carve tunnels but for whatever reason this doesnt work if youre trying to build up or down which is the main thing this would actually be useful for you also cant edit terrain under a barrier or a path which i could kind of understand except you icani edit terrain under a ride and it will simply generate support pillars as if it was elevated to begin with  why not treat paths the same way

switching gears even years after release the game struggles with glitches and optimization i had no fewer than 10 crashes in my time playing and a fair number of bugs one example is a bug where my staff simply refused to feed my starving animals which people online confidently assert was only a prerelease thing and was fixed by the games release which i can confirm isnt the case ive also had multiple animals clip through walls as well not climb over not break down but literally just phase through

all that text and i havent said a word about the story its serviceable the writing is pretty generic the voice acting is pretty forced and every plot twist is disappointingly anticlimactic but its fine i understand that people generally dont play zoo management games for the story but its still nice to have story beats to contextualize the levels and the story beats are there

the more i tried to engage with this game the more i was put off whenever i tried to engage it more as a sandbox i was frustrated by all the building mechanics whenever i tried to engage it as a game with a campaign i was frustrated by the various unexplained overdone and broken systems i started my review talking about grids and i want to leave off my review by saying why not follow the cities skylines solution have the exact same pathbuilding mechanics but have paths generate grids alongside them for habitats buildings and more id love to be able to construct a building place paths and facilities neatly inside it maybe even a ride station possibly even a habitat  but the game seems actively designed to never allow you to do something like that and i dont think the game is better for it

#####

id recommend waiting for patchesupdatesreworks id refund this game at this point if i could its like a bad case of teenage love  youre enchanted for first 5 hours then youre just getting frustrated

to start with the absolute worst  animal market the idea of online trading with other players might be interesting but to make it the only way of acquiring new animals is just a design flaw poor technical execution only makes it worse i dread buying animals in a zoo simulation game 

the ui  looks nice but is tough to operate it lacks some aggregative options which contribute to annoying micromanagment in the later phases the animations are also clunky which takes away from the slick design 

the building system  its either tough to learn or straight up annoying prepare yourself to memorize some hotkeys as again ui isnt your friend here i have 10 hours at the point of writing this review and i just couldnt be bothered to create my own food stalls because of how frustrating designing them is

difficulty franchise mode  once i discovered the donation bins i never worried about money again it was just a matter of waiting not really long at that before creating more and more enclosures then its just a snowball effect maybe this should be nerfed donations are constantly the biggest part of my income 60

small animals exhibitions  just meh to be honest

powerwater utilities  adds some depth but you could go without it comes out as a flaw when added to all the other micromanagment

other than that the game has some buggy behaviour here and there but thats nothing that cannot be fixed in a span of a few weeks

as for the good things  the game has a soul and some great potential when it doesnt kick me in the balls with all the issues i listed before  i really enjoy playing it the animal choice is decent and theyre all really well done graphics are alright soundtrack is really cool

it gives you a lot of satisfaction when you stop for a minute and enjoy what you created so far but then you get 10 notifications that some animal is stressed research has been completed a tortoise is suddenly starving and its really far away from a feeder relatively speeking so before it reaches it you get a flock of protesters then some warthogs are fighting because of a bad sex ratio because your pack of 10 small hogs have just grown up oh and an atm 17 and atm 18 have just broken down  better click on that call mechanic button now

got me a crocodile named steve and a bear named frank 

its as simple as that bois

i desperately want to love this game  i have invested nearly 200 hours in trying to love it  in trying to find satisfactory ways to overcome the most glaring faults  the graphics are beautiful and i am a long time fan of tycoon games so i should really love this but i hate it   

there is so much here for tycoon game fans to love  but  the game is so frustrating  now i admit i am a bit overly tidy and critical of my layouts whether in city building railway or any other style of tycoon game  but i have to ask myself have the developers actually tried to play this game 

paths can eventually be made to link together but particularly if you want to extend paths it can be incredibly difficult or even impossible without major destruction and rebuilding

building habitats is a nightmare  this could be fixed with an optional grid and a snap to grid function 

an optional grid and snap to function would be useful for many other items  some items have a snap to function others do not and only paths snap to grid which you have to turn on each time you wish to add to paths  but beware it is not always possible to add to your grid paths in the way you require you cannot snap fences to this grid why not

some items can be grouped into a blueprint but not all  my most useful blueprint in parkitect is a small rest area containing benches a litter bin a light and some decorative items  i place this at regular intervals  a fiddly problem solved  here you cannot put lights seats and bins in a blue print why not

now try to sell an animal from an exhibit  a couple of clicks should do it  select and confirm  nothing so straight forward here    it is a marathon of selection and confirmation clicks and different menus six clicks and two menus is the minimum

unfortunately one of your exhibit animals dies and there is no replacement on offer  you have an empty exhibit but it is occupied  go figure  actually you can override this by placing a different  incompatible  animal in the exhibit  but this is not obvious and is quite annoying

i could go on for a very long time with listing the faults  some are  just annoying some are very serious  the upshot is this game is not fun  it is an exercise in infinite patience and handling frustration  it is very pretty but it is not fun

#####

love this game surprisingly versatile it can be either incredibly relaxing or a strenuous challenge depending on how you play  i have two franchise zoos now one is slowpaced and relaxing when i want that kind of gameplay and one is big and a definite challenge to stay on top of everything  its two completely different gameplay experiences and i like having that variety the animals are wonderful some of their social interactions are a bit simplistic but its still fun to watch them interact with each other like watching a baby lemur sneak up on its parent and pounce on them or watching two baby elephants play together some of the social structure requirements are very unrealistic such as requiring one single alpha male for matriarchal species such as lemurs bonobos elephants and lions  as well as requiring one alpha male for species that dont have that social structure in the wild such as chimps antelope bison etc but i understand that its a video game and i dont expect 100 accuracy the building system takes some getting used to but once you get the hang of it its very enjoyable and definitely allows for incredible creativity  definitely worth the price in my opinion i absolutely recommend this game

#####

it goes to show that making a good zoo tycoon game is 100 doable i absolutely love plant zoo i sat on it for awhile honestly scared of the price point and waited for it to go on sale and i do regret doing that its such a well done game with many options to choose from you can do career mode franchises mode or sandbox mode and theyre all just as fun i used to play wild life park and honestly been waiting for an updated good zoo tycoon to eventually come out i would 100 recommend buying this if youre on the fence about it as well as the dlcs as the animals are so worth it theres many options to choose from for building shops habitats pathways ponds etc etc its a bit overwhelming and not knowing where to start but once you get going its hard to stop

i do hope to see more animals eventually added with possibly more birds such as parrots for aviaries and fish for ponds so they can be more than just a decor item in the zoos but ill happily wait for whatever else they decide to release

the only thing id say is that the animal market in franchise mode is kind of insane sometimes with some animals being worth a ton of leaf points but genetics being garbage and some you cant even sell without lowering the leaf point cost of them as no one will buy them so theyre in your inventory for a long time as well as the actual animal market freezing for me and not able to buy some stuff and having to close the market to reopen it again being an annoying thing that happens on my end but i can easily look over it once you get your animals going and breeding and being able to sell them for leaf points it does get easier

the other thing is the micromanaging of your employees at the zoo maybe its just me who hasnt gotten the hang of it yet but its a lot of sending keepers here sending clean up there because they only reach certain areas i know you can set up zones but as your zoo expands it gets hard to keep track of it all and ive found for me its easier to just keep all the zones clear and send them to specific areas

if you want to worry less sandbox mode would be useful for that one with unlimited money and you can sit in pause until you feel like youre ready to go but it does get boring after awhile with no challenge so i find myself sticking to franchise more often than not regardless of the annoying employees who slack off more often than not

like i said its a super in depth game to ticket prices employee wages and training to animal husbandry and power sources its a lot to deal with at first glance and even im still learning stuff i didnt know before

#####

there is an undeniable learning curve when it comes to some of the quite frankly unnecessary features of this game
theres a lot of research youll probably have to do onthefly when first starting out youll spend a lot of time looking up youtube vids or reddit threads to try and figure out what youre supposed to be doing or what it is youre doing wrong

as a longtime fan of ye olden zoo tycoon series since its beginning is this worth the buy the short answer iiiiis yes yes it is
if youre willing to put a little extra time in to try and understand some of the mechanics and limp along without the help of some muchneeded tutorials when youre first getting going after that its gud and fun

ok so building necessary facilities and things like water treatmentpower sources is a bit of an annoyance for me especially in the harder difficulties of franchise mode where it takes longer to more varied better power options
who wants to mess with generators when youre building a zoo yes you are given a starting area in a typical zoo where your front entrance area is powered  but is it that big not really you quickly outgrow the size of the bubble
i just feel like the power and water cleanliness aspect of this game was something that could be handled by a simple budgeting menu and not city builderesque areas of effect

thats not to mention the fact that the grid mode can be downright stupid and frustrating and the different terrain elevations get under my skin
i had one zoo where because two parallel paths oh god the pathing in this game reeks to be honest were at very slightly different elevations  and the difference was so minuscule i couldnt even see it  the paths just would just not hook up to each other no matter how much i deletedreplaced them tried to flatten everything around and redo it etc just stupid
and thats not even the only stupid aspect of the pathing its very finicky in general
pathing has more of a freeform style to it like most everything in this game which is a pretty nice thing for the most part tbh but with pathing specifically i would kill for some gridding options that dont utterly suck

fences also get more timeconsuming to build the more curvy a path gets and instead of having any nice clickanddrag options for fences youre expected to pretty much come up with custom layouts every time even if your habitat would be better as a simple square
also im not going to go on a rant about work zones but they are just kind of tedious and without proper titling they will just mess you up and confuse you more than anything sigh

that said this game is pretty terrific even in its current state of sorely lacking tutorials having weird pathing and utilities work zones being weird etc i still find this game to be incredibly fun and it really gets my creative juices going
if you feel like youre a more extrinsically motivated person when it comes to games and cant really do a more sandbox type of playstyle youll be pretty happy with career mode i have lots of fun in franchise too  probably the most fun of any of the other modes
the character customization leaves a lot to be desired but thats not what this game is about is it this game is really about

the animals
the animals absolutely rock they have so many unique animations and move so realistically and look so realistic in general
theres a very good variety for the base game imo a lot of very solid choices to pick from with a good helping of fauna representation from lots of areas of the world as well as different biomes
they have very reasonable wants and needs and its a lot of fun designing their habitats and then getting to watch them run around and have fun the baby animals are adorable you wont have a dull moment when youre watching these guys
i think theyre so great that i dont even have much more to say

the designing  is another highlight of the game for me base game has a kind of lackluster variety when it comes to buildings and such but oh my goshthe foliage is almost enough on its own to make up for that this game really puts the aesthetic of your zoo and the animals in it first and foremost which is pretty admirable
designing these super unique livedin gorgeous habitats for a nice variety of animals is so satisfying and its awesome to see the animals utilizing some of the foliage and habitat decor and playitems youve set up you can make enrichment objects especially the scratching tree type ones blend in pretty nicely with environments

in one of the previous paragraphs i mentioned difficulty connecting two parallel paths that by all accounts shouldve been able to link up to each other lickitysplit
well for that middle section that was just left to be grass i actually decided to make it a median strip full to the brim with trees plants rocks etc and wow did it look nice i kind of commend the game in that respect for getting me to think of alternative options when my vision isnt able to be carried out in the way i wanted it to be
now is this intentional on the devs part most certainly not lol im just making the best out of a frustrating situation and im sure you can do this too in your copy if you run into a construction wall like me

overall a lot of ups and downs here  and lots of stuff i didnt talk about  but coming from a lifelong zoo tycoon fan this game is good
i would absolutely recommend it for just the animals and design aspects alone the graphics are beyondmarvelous the strategic elements are also pretty good and franchise mode especially w managing your conservation points carefully is lots of fun and a great challenge

theres lots of wrinkles to be ironed and you should definitely try to catch this on sale if you can but i really like this game a lot  and its still being updated which is nice
planet zoo feels like a huge step in the right direction in the attempt to modernize the old zoobuilder games of the past
nice job devs

#####

the game is amazing and is so detailed i used to be a zookeeper and this game is like reliving it

#####

fun but i suck

#####

my dream from when i was 3 or 4 years old was to have my very own zoo as i grew up i realized that was silly not any more

#####

i miss when games launched with all content included

#####

i go buy an aadvark and he is happy this is the best game

#####

hello i am an avid player of zoo building simulators like zoo tycoon megaquarium and planet zoo
i have felt increasing levels of frustration as i have watched the development of planet zoo at the lack of addition of more diverse aquatic creatures and tank building mechanics i simply dont see why fish sharks groupers etc cant be added to a game that already features aquatic animals with dynamic speciesappropriate swimming patterns and depths such as the grey seal and beaver adding tanks would make the game more interesting right now we have three enclosure types  regular habitats the small and preset terrarium habitats and the flight cages which werent working well at all as of the last time i played having tanks and water systems as a fourth kind of habitat would offer players exciting variety and more creative freedom achieving tanklike aesthetics is possible in the current game but it requires a lot of knowledge and time spent placing each part of a structure or terrain to make sure it works not all players know how to build these sorts of things and its hard for a lot of the player base to rely solely on mods or blueprints to build the zoos they are imagining on top of this fanmade tank structures dont compensate for the lack of items or settings to reduce water murkiness in underwater display areas or the lack of any large fish or cetaceans in the game please add this feature coding may be an issue and i understand that it takes time and money to produce but theres no possible way that its just too hard if a zoo tycoon 2 modder can add new fish to that game with programmed swimming routes in their free time im sure planet zoo has the resources to implement this feature

#####

this is the best zoo simulation game i have ever played 


#####

i liked this game on release the general gameplay and execution is good my problem is the content itself this game can get boring quickly and the developers have resorted to making small dlc additions that cost much more money than they are worth

#####

would highly recommend the game if you enjoy losing yourself to hours of minute details that have to be just right  in all seriousness though this is one of the better buildingsim games out there

#####

yesterday i watched an african wild dog roll its little pup over while playing in the enclosure and i realised there was passion involved in making this game a game about animals in a zoo and its probably as good as it can be for this era of computer systems and im serious here just watching the interactions the modelling and the animations is a pretty special thing

but you know there are some horrible glitchy issues and it reminds me yet again as seems to happen so often in games with high quality visuals  that more attention is being applied to scenery modelling and animations than the gameplay programming and this title is no exception

sure whilst its awesome to sit and watch animals frolic under your carefully placed scenery all the stuff that allows you to buy breed feed and manage those animals had better bloody work too frequent crashing on low and high end systems high server latency and annoying ai bugs leave you quietly raging at why this is becoming so common in every damn title these days  

guys ffs just tell the publisher youre not ready for once be brave think of the gamers who strikeendurestrike buy your product

but certainly worth a buy theres sandbox challenge and franchise modes so you can build the biggest your cpu will allow or be a pedantic trader and try to fill the market with 100 level gold animals to make the most conservation credits possible

7510  will go 95 if they iron out the issues properly

#####

ok this is another of those cases in which a neutral review would be ideal

the thing is that the game is ok you have a lot of animals a nice breeding system a franchise survival mode which is usually the goto mode for me different habitats biomes a lot of personalization shops a happiness system for your clientsvisitors and staff etc

the big problem is the optimization i tried playing on franchise mode building a zoo big enough to put all the animals available in the base version of the game around 7k visitors and the game just couldnt make it i mean 5 fps heavy lag stuttering etc i know these games are heavy cpuintensive but my cpu never surpassed 30 of usage

after reading in the forums was pretty obvious that im not the only one even people recommended to not play franchise mode and instead to play sandbox which ill not because that mode is for pussies  jk to limit the amount of visitor which is a big factor in the calculations the game does others even said things like i just build zoos until they begin to lag then i start another which is pretty sad imo so i couldnt enjoy the game like i was expecting to i know i have more than 100 hours of playtime but most of these where playing the career mode which consists in a series of challenges with little zoos

well because of that and the fact i cant make a neutral review this will be a dont recommend sorry

#####

if you enjoy creating stuff this game is for you it has all the positives from old zoo tycoon games with the ability to heavily detail environments for your animals you can play this game in a variety of ways that can make it a challenge or you can have fun in a sandbox mode while i do recommend the game i have a very beefy pc and still experience issues with how much cpu this game requires  my specs include a evga geforce rtx 2060amd ryzen 9 3900x gskill tridentz rgb 32gb the game will occasionally crash and i never have an issue running other games with high graphics i believe this is an oversight on the developers end since ive found others having the same issues online the dlc is fairly priced for what they include overall i would rate the game 8510

#####

wait to buy when dlc is on sale makes big diff

#####

you can trap human beings in cages and make animal fight to the death

#####

disclaimer  this isnt actually really a zoo management simulator  its actually a construction engine masquerading as a zoo management simulator  that being said it excels at both  some of the building mechanics have a relatively steep learning curve but once mastered this game provides for far more customization and creativity than other titles in the genre  the devs after releasing a number of contentliteintermsofanimals dlcs have finally realized that the majority of the people who play this game arent youtubers who need 1209486098600 construction pieces and are casual gamers who want more animals and recently put out a dlc that adds 8 animals an additional 20 increase from the base game so user feedback is a thing theyre paying attention to  as far as animals go its come a good way from launch when the animals had no personality and just sort of wandered around forgetting to eat  the graphics are gorgeous and the animators put time in to making the animals really pop  the ai isnt perhaps the most intuitive ever but it really doesnt matter too much  really the only frustrating thing is when the path system and construction system refuse to play nicely and when guests hate your zoo despite your pristine and beautiful presentation because the lines at the drink stands are slightly too long  overall 910 game far exceeds prior titles in the zoo sim genre due to both the presentation and the vast number of creative tools at your disposal

#####

well kinda its very addictive once youve gotten the hang of and possibly personalized the controls highly recommended to start out with a cheat sheet dont be discouraged if it takes some time to learn all of the ways you can build its incredibly powerful and thus might take a lot of time to master 

but yeah over 1000 hours is a lot  
if youre ok with the prospect of potentially being stuck in a tycoon game its very rewarding to admire your creations when youve finally managed to build something youve been working on for a while

remember to go back and look at your progress 
dont compare yourself to youtubers or others in general but take inspiration from everyone
try recreate your favourite zoopark and add all of the things youre missing from the real world one
utilize community heatmaps

also played a bit on the steamdeck surprisingly smooth both performance and controls

#####

the game teaches you to manage three things animals money and your cpu temperature

#####

i am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is 14 now my son got this game for christmas in 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game picked my character and world and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories

h1well worth the base price but fck me the dlcs are expensiveh1
pros #1 lots of animals though you have to pay for some of them
#2 the game is beautiful and the quality of basically everything in the game is amazing
#3 the game runs smooth and thats surprising considering how amazing the graphics are
#4 theres well over 30hours of content in the game excluding sandbox
#5 the follow cam on animals is really cool and i can and have spend hours just following a little meerkat around

cons #1 infected with denuvo malware
#2 the dlcs are very expensive and they actually contain some really cool animals so youre missing out on the full zoo experience if you dont purchase the dlcs ofcourse creamapi is your friend on the high seas
#3 theres several bugs in the game still even 2years after release such as the keepers not filling up certain types of feeders which can lead to your animals simply not eating and then dying
#4 the negative aura around some buildings like power generators go through walls which make no sense you can literally build a 20foot high concrete wall around the generator and it doesnt stop the negative aura at all

conclusion its a beautiful game with a lot of things that can be improved by the developers if they wanted to but despite those issues its still a game worth buying and playing but the dlcs are simply criminal

once youve gotten the hang of it you can do anything i usually play games really intensely for a short period of time but planet zoo is just something i keep coming back to

#####

very good i love moneky

#####

if you like building and management games this is the game for you it allows you to build your zoo however you like unless of course the paths dont fit should it be the case that like me you lack the motivation to come up with your own handcrafted designs you must not fear for you will spend a lot of time on the workshop page which is filled to the brim with awesome creations to help out newcomers and expert zoo designers alike the base game offers enough objects and animals to feel fleshed out and enjoyable but if you like the game you will not want to miss out on things like the aquatic pack and to all the zoo tycoon 12 players this is just what you need to fill that zt3shaped hole in your heart

#####

overall i would definitely recommend the base game frontier seem to always have a free update alongside dlc releases so you still get something new without spending money the career is pretty chill and helps you learn the game the online can be great and horrible greedy people selling animals for insane amounts of cc making casualnew players unable to buy anything but peafowl the challenge mode is great for those who dont like the online aspects the sandbox is amazing for those who like to stretch those creative muscles

the dlcs are hit and miss with some people i much prefer the packs that have building pieces as it gives a bit more bulk to the pack and breathe new life into the game with more options for customising builds many think the packs need to have more animals in them which i agree with if it is an animal only pack with no building pieces

after some hiccups in the first few months of the game frontier have become really good at listening to the community and giving detailed patch notes i would recommend you join the forums to keep up with everything

#####

the best zoo manager game ever made the variety of animals scenarios or free play and scenery make for a game that fits both the management challenges that are enjoyable in the genre and also the fun of sitting back and watching the animals play its a joy the fact the devs are working on it 35 years later and continuing to add features is another huge plus

#####

this game gives you unprecedented creative freedom theres no denying that but theres one aspect that makes it unplayable remember how the trailer promised you meaningful management i think what they meant is annoying micromanagement

in similiar games like rct3 or zoo tycoon i just loved letting the game play out all by itself watching the park live blablabla this is impossible in planet zoo that is if your zoo is big enough you unpause the game and in 30 seconds an avalanche of notifications just burries you with stuff like
 male zebra has matured its now fighting for the alpha status  and you have to pause everything inspect your zebras and send some poor guy away 
 this animals been held in a container for way too long and again you pause the game find the animal and release it all along wondering just how the hell it ended up in a container in the first place 
 orm y favorite by far the animal is starving thats right planet zoo is really pricey and yet its ai is so stupid it sometimes freaking stops feeding animals setting up work zones and dedicated keepers doesnt help this also begs a question why the hell is there no cook some food and feed the animals button you can only summon a keeper whos probably just going to step into a habitat and leave right away
i currently have 250 animals in my zoo and i simply avoid unpausing the game effectively turning planet zoo into a fancy 3d landscape desing editor that costs freaking 50 bucks like i finished building a new section of my zoo more than an hour ago  and none of the guests has reached it yet because i constantly have to stop and deal with breeding lions save giraffes from starvation or whatever

as if this is not enough you also have to deal with electricity and water treatment  this is beyond stupid it adds nothing of value to the game and only serves as a source of annoyance

and to make matters worse there are simply tons of minor uiux issues that make management even less bearable

#####

i like this game i do im an ecologist so these kinda games are my jam but its a pretty shell on an empty centre

its lacking a lot of functionality and gameplay features that would make it more enjoyable and appeal to a wider audience there is far too much finicky micromanagement weird placement mechanics and im not a huge fan of the stylised animals but the latter is what mods are for i supposeso maybe let people mod freely

my biggest gripe besides the drip fed dlc222 to get half the game content if its not on sale thanks frontier you crooks is the lack of a safari mode a mode where animals can graze terrain interact and essentially live like wild animals free of all the keepers micromanagement and annoying repetitive processes you have to go through to get anything interesting looking unfortunately there are no realistic ecological interactions between speciespredators cant eat their kills etc itd be amazing if grasses and trees etc could grow spread and be eaten and controlled by herbivores and if predators werent mindless killing machines but would hunt appropriate prey species when they were hungry im hoping the whiz kid modders will be able to use jwe2 code to eventually do some of this more realistic predatorprey interactions and even grazable terrainat least invisible auto feeder stations or something

i feel that for a game centred around conservation they missed an opportunity to teach kids and adults alike about ecological interactions in a more meaningful and realistic way than the simplified this plant bad for this animal coz it from different place

710 

buy it on sale buy dlc on sale use the mods it could be a lot better but we need to be drip fed expensive dlc animal reskins so frontier can make a killing whilst doing nothing to improve gameplay

#####

i madea monkey enclosure

#####

absolutely love this game as someone who really enjoys management and organisation games and grew up playing zoo tycoon this truly hit the mark for everything i love ive learnt a bunch of interesting facts about animals to annoy those around me with really its just an extremely fun game base game is more than enough to have a really fun experience and 100 worth the buy

i would love to have some more career modes though as they are the best part of the game for me it gives you goals to work towards with a fun story line and doesnt get old like playing just the franchise mode can because as good as the game is in franchise mode you reach a point where you make so much profit theres no challenge anymore you can buy and research everything you need and that leaves not much to do besides expand your zoo until your computer cant handle it it would be cool if they added events at random or the option for events to happen like taking on emergency animals or something to do with the guests to keep things interesting but outside of that its an amazing game and i would recommend it to anyone

#####

this game has so much potential i want to give the frontier team a few props because they have done amazing things the graphics and the ai for animals staff and guests is great the game play actually taking care of zoo is really fun as well there is a feeling of joy when you see the guests happy animals are playing around and the zoo making money while knowing that you did all that although the game is a lot of fun i might have to stop playing because of how upset it makes me 

now here is what i hate like really hate about the game building

what really caught my attention was the building aspect of the game one of the biggest games out there right now is minecraft because you can build things easily and share with people not only can you build but it is extremely easy to make changes in the game it takes time to build but anyone can build anything again it is easy to build the easier it is the more people will use it easy

now this game planet zoo 
you need to take online courses to know how to build in this game so many tips and tricks knowing commands and at the end of the day you still might not be able to create your masterpiece the most common complain is the path system trying to build a simple plaza was one of the worst experience but once you know how you need to start it and what path settings you need it can be done but if you make one change just one you will most likely need to build it from scratch again next up is structure placement it is difficult sometime impossible to align building or items to be perpendicular  or parallel to a path or another structure finally barriers also has major pit falls same as with structures aligning barrier to be perpendicular or parallel with the path is difficult after a habitat barrier is created it is difficult to expand or shrink the size and keep the correct angles sometime you just need to start from scratch  

i really do have a love and hate relationship with the game hard to say if i would recommend this game or not because i can see two different types of people playing 

i would recommend  
to people who want to focus on the franchise and expanding the zoo quickly people who are not big into design are not nitpicking about symmetry or making things looking perfect people who want to enjoy the actual game play as much as possible 

i would not recommend  
people who enjoy building items from scratch are nitpicking or want things to look perfect if you really want to focus on the creativity aspect of this game i would not recommend

to frontier 
planet zoo has features to share custom structures with the community but if they can simplify the building aspect the game will have so much more custom items much more publicity youtube reddit instragram and all leading to more players please focus on the current issues that the gaming community has been  spoken up about it will help a lot

m o n k e 

#####

addictive wish dlc was cheaper

#####

game is pretty good the best zoo simulator out there and you can tell from my hours in game that i like it so why the negative vote

whilst its enough for me i cannot recommend to most others due to a wide range of issues a few of those

 maps there are very few if you start a new map it will be blank so if you want interesting terrain to work with you have about 12 levels and a lot of those are tiny and than about 1 new map per dlc if your lucky

 dlc there are lots they are fairly expensive for what you get generally 34 animals 1 map and a few building pieces that said they often come with some small addition to the game for free which should be pointed out as a positive a lot of companies do not do this as they nickle and dime you but still the dlc is very important otherwise the game feels quite lacking especially in animals

 performance there are a lot of performance issues that have been present since launch lag memory drain etc over all if you have a good pc these are not to bad but they are much worse on lower pc but overall id say performancewise it does quite well at least compared to the industry standard

 bugs here is where it fails a fair bit a lot of them have a significant impact on your game as well things like 
 animals walking through walls 
 traversable areas not loading correctly making animals get stuck think they have nothing to climbswim etc 
 staff not feeding animals or cleaning habitats or boxing animals and just leaving them there
 pathing issues 
 guests looking through walls 
 many of the mission maps are broken in some way and often locks the the tools or abilities to fix it such as editing terrain or specific buildings
 plants outside a habitat reducing the plants rating for a habitat if they are above below or a tree slightly over the fence
 animals being flagged as escaped if they enter a cave within their habitat that is under a barrier fence
 water crashing if you add or remove it seemingly at random since the aquatic update

 than there are a few issues that really should have been addressed however they are not bugs so much as quality of life improvements 
 pathsfencingterrain and water are all a bit of a pain when you try to do anything remotely complex 
 guests viewing animals from odd spots in addition to looking through solid walls they will often ignore the points that are the best to view animals from and will simply choose the closest place and than complain about the view being bad
 transport rides are pretty broken and will often be completely empty
 exhibits need to have some way to auto sell off excess animals often they will be basically overflowing with more animals than you want which causes you to need to micromanage them
 there is no minimap can at times make it quite hard to find where you are
 the animal info panel can be quite tedious to deal with when you are setting up a habitat and trying to balance animals needs since you will be forced out of it anytime you click on an object
 item rotation could be more precise if you are making something detailed can be a bit of a fight working with the controls if you care about it being precise
 the inability to do anything with children cannot sell cannot trade away this can lead to over populated habitats you cannot easily fix
 habitats only being allowed one entrance no matter how large the habitat is the keeper will always need to enter from the same spot
 having no real feedback on store prices and if guests are happy with it or not how much they are willing to pay what the effects of extras on items are etc
 the tiniest amount of water being too much for a keeper to walk through
 guests being able to detect facility buildings which make them mad for some reason even if the the buildings are underground or not visable
 some objects being able to be rotated on only the x axis instead of like most objects the y and z axis as well
 educators being a pain to deal with need to have space to throw food be close enough to land to throw food need to schedule the educator always get complaints that they walk to far dont have enough to do and they cost too much for what they do they should work like all other employees and when a podium is empty they move there with after having given a talk the podium being deactivated for a little month or two simple
 animals should have a minimum need for plants but not a maximum limits creativity makes some habitats look quite bad by comparison
 being unable to remove and than readd water to the same height without removing most path and shops before hand that touched that water if they are close enough and legal to place there prior to removing the water
 setting filters should be a lot easier and managed from the animal info panel at the moment swapping it in an out not to mention turning it off if you want to add rocks and back is quite a pain

#####

this is a game for people who like to design not for people who like to manage the management part and ui are very tedious

#####

mmmm monke

#####

if you love to build you are creative and patient this game is differently for you
if you like animals love to breed and go for the best this game is for you 
i like this game have 500h of playtime and still playing

excellent game the spiritual successor to zoo tycoon it could have more varieties of animals but i appreciate the quality of those we do have and understand that they must be very difficult to program the devs seem to be responsive to player feedback 

i bought it at full price and dont regret it at all i also bought the deluxe edition and the arctic animal dlc both of which i think were worth the price

#####

game is great with a steep learning curve that feels very rewarding once you manage to explore the endless possibilities that it offers you however it ends up punishing you for running a successful zoo if you happen to have 5000 guests you are very likely to experience severe fps drops to the point where it gets unplayabe unfortunately this problem will happen regardless of your rig

the game itself is super fun but the controls are a disaster

#####

zoo good yes

#####

if you like park management games and have any interest in animals then this is a must have

so much better than i was expecting you can customise just about anything in terms of item placement and colour i made my own animal shelter so they can hide when tired by laying a metal structure then i placed the stone cladding out myself and decorated it with plants and flowers you have full 3d rotational control over items theres even hanging vines 

if youre being put off buying this because of experience with jurassic world evolution then please dont be although i enjoyed jw evo planet zoo makes that game like puddle deep shallow 

yes i have had 2 crashes whilst playing but ive played for just under 5 hours in that time im sure stability patches will happen

h1another  i really tried to like this game buth1

not a true spiritual successor to the original zoo tycoon 

this also speaks true for planet coaster it becomes clearer when you look at the fan base of these two planetgamesbplanet zoo and planet coaster are architecture gamesb
you simply cannot escape or ignore its one true focus because otherwise theres little to nothing else for you


the core of the game is making elaborate and realistic buildingsarchitecture by utilizing 480 million of the tiny building pieces the game gives you 

sure you can still plop down prebuilts from the game and from other peoples creation from the steam workshopbut the charm of easily creating something your own by plopping down things and still managing to be unique and creative despite limited set pieces etc yeah thats not here in these games

sure the devs patched in a lot of the management aspects into the game in response to peoples complaint but you can tell they are still secondary to the architectural design aspect thus not feeling quite right on paper it looks like they added mechanics that are gamey enough upon playing it feels like they just added a ton of unfun micromanagement  mechanics that somehow also feels like they dont add anything to the game 

everything in these games feels unnecessarily complicated remember complication  depth even the ui iteslf is extremely cluttered requiring several button presses every time to view some extremely basic stats or to do an extremely basic action 

this game is a very pretty game that lets you build anything you want and by building anything you want you are limited to non functional makebelieve set pieces thus from a gameplay perspective there is little to nothing to offer oh you spent 10 hours building a realistic playground complete with slides and everything for your park well all its going to do is just sit there looking pretty in the end its still a set piece with no guestinteractable function 


in summary planet games are pretty setpiecedesigning games for architectureoriented people who are inspired and enjoy expressing those architectural designrelated inspirations by spending 15 hrs building a single very elaborate and realistic building from the ground up using 480 million 173593 trillion if you count the dlcs teeny tiny set pieces and doing that over and over again until they fill the whole park and inevitably destroy their frame rate which is another issue the game has of course theres nothing wrong with that if thats whats fun to you but if you go into these games with a purpose other than that youll be quickly disappointed  


so beware if youre about to buy the game thinking its like the tycoon games from the olden days also you cannot kill guests by unleashing all your bears and lions in fact there is no such interaction at all besides guests running away as soon as a fence is deleted the devs have stated the game is developed with realism and conservation in mind meaning no video gamey fun allowed which is also why polar bears dlc animal require an exhibit the size of a whole continent and dlcs similar to marine mania and dinosaur digs will certainly never come to fruition 

#####

finally something that matches or even beats the zoo tycoon franchise  lots to do lots to manage  great animal animations  ive been playing for awhile and im still finding new things

#####

best zoo game out there lots of management options lots of animals plenty of modding available

only complaint is performance if you want a big zoo youre going to need an animal of a pc get it 910

#####

can all you turbocapitalist devs please announce at the time of release when you plan on selling the game piece by piece 10 each for a total of 1000 then people like me wouldnt fall for it and look for something else or would that kind of honesty conflict with your business model

you dont even let owners complete what they already have at the bundle price like most others do thats unfair towards early buyers and you know damn well that nobody likes to play an incomplete game thats what your whole strategy is based on so youre slowly bleeding your core player base dry while new buyers get lured in with exclusive bundle prices that you deny to your existing players


edit please no more comments that 1000 is exaggerated im well aware that we havent passed the 1000 mark yet as everyone can see right here on the store page its an unmistakable hyperbole and not a fiendish attempt to spread misinformation

#####

i cant make the supercreative zoos i see on youtube but i absolutely love my grid zoos and my arachnidonlsd spiderweb pathways that result when i try to be creative very cool game

#####

as someone who isnt particularly creative this game can certainly be overwhelming at first especially with all the customization options at your disposal but once you find your way it gets extremely fun and addicting

#####

original review been waiting for this game to pop up since the beta i was really excited in the beta process and noticed the bugs that many others did but chalked it up to the fact that its a beta the gameplay was great there was a unique concept in here that made it so much more than a simple tycoon game its follows along with planet coasters style has a deep level of management and design that really drew me in 

however now that its launched im fairly disappointed the game play is still there the fun is still there but many of the bugs that i saw reported that plagued the beta that a lot of people complained about were still there it feels like the devs didnt release a beta to work out some bugs they just released a teaser to buy a little extra time of development they may have taken out some of the bugs but nothing so far that affected me was addressed buttons that require clicking in a very specific spot animals being moved and saying theyre not in the park anymore but just in a different habitat etc its very frustrating that the deluxe edition i paid for to get the beta and everything feels like it was a waste now and it feels like they released an early access version at this point 

dont get me wrong i like the game but its not what i was expecting for such hype on the forums their reddit and the launch videos 

for now i am giving this game a no but i will revise as updates come in and things do actually get fixed im sad to give it this cause i like the games this company puts out but this game dropped the ball on its release

update ive not taken the time to play this game for over a week now lost interest due to some of the bugs and such that were mentioned by myself and others pretty disappointed in something i was super excited about however i have heard that there is an update coming with stated features ie animal life cycle adjusters that may change things i will update this once that is released and am able to play with the new features



revised review 
i have put some more time into this game over the quarantine and such i have to say that with the new dlc has good and bad parts to it and the updates that have come through while i still have some issues with it the overall game is now a recommendation for sure i will update with more details later but i felt this deserved getting switched right away

#####

planet zoo is a remarkable sandbox game my personal favourite so far if you love animals and enjoyed playing the tycoon games this would be a great buy i recommend 

#####

digital animals soothe me

#####

built beautiful zoo
had nice amazing looking animals
lots of money and guests
monkeys escaped
critic not pleased
bear escaped
i now have no money

all in all 1010

#####

i love planet zoo im addicted to it  but the only disappointment is that when you make a pond you cant add fish or ducks and i would love to have a fish pond for my guest i want to see more wild animals like foxs  and a moose  and all sorts of other wild animals

#####

update apr 10 20 im contemplating turning this into a positive review but ill need to play more in order to be sure there are still some very important things to keep in mind 1 this game will never be nor replace zoo tycoon it is too complicated in ways zt was not and this makes it a poor vessel to tell the kinds of stories one could in zoo tycoon it is a management simulator first and foremost even in sandbox mode 2 the franchise mode is significantly better than at launch and still totally optional but has some problems still however for now the essence of my initial review remains the same 3 if you are like me and were in it for the animals buy the zt download on amazon for 20 theres no fast forward button but its still darn good if you like games like planet coaster and sim city give this one a shot its a beautiful interesting management game where the roller coasters are replaced by excellently rendered animals

update nov 16 19 given that the multiplayer aspect of this game has taken a sharp turn from cooperative into unfriendly competition my opinion of the game is at an all time low i continue to not recommend

to preface this i hope to revise my review in the future and change my recommendation coming from a supreme love of zoo tycoon i was super excited about this but so far cannot recommend as it stands it is an overcomplicated management game just with animals instead of roller coasters it focuses on people and their needs rather than telling stories with animals  

so what are the failings of pz in comparison to zt 
1 overemphasis on management and maintenance just like jurassic world evo the fact that you have to not only place power stations but deal with them breaking down while pseudorealistic just adds a nagging that i am not interested in while playing 
2 unintuitivecomplex controls i know you can do a lot with planet tools but as a nonplanetcoaster player i am unfamilar with the controls though terrain tools are pretty cool most of the tools are overly complex placing and deleting fence can be frustrating once i figured them out even they take a very long time to use if you want to create beautifuldecent things if i felt i could play the game with just blueprints it would be okay but there arent quite enough blueprints and i am a somewhat unartistic person
3 too fast sure you can pause but the base speed of the game is still quite fast resulting in several negative effects from my perspective an individual animal matters less once you make a decently profitable zoo youll make so much money you cant spend it all especially in franchise mode money is completely inconsequential and the only thing that matters is an alternative currency known as conservation credits
4 you are supposed to build a zoo for humans though you can theoretically do more with pz the central awesomeness of zt radiated from maybe not creating a zoo but instead a wildlife preserve or crazy arena there actually were hunting animations in zt which i hope they add to pz this plays into the very first point i made this is just planet coaster but the rides are animals i dunno about the other people who play this game but i dont really care about the people most of the time i want to see the animals be interesting

all said i do love how beautiful the animal textures are but i find myself too busy with the rest of the management that im uninterested in to watch them do cool things i also really miss the simple thing in zt that when you clicked on an animal there was a little text description of what they were doing following mother drinking from water dish it meant i could be interested in an individual creature instead of treating them like a commodity 

if you liked planet coaster i bet youll like this game ill keep playing as bugs get fixed and new patches come out and i hope to soon join you in loving this game

#####

very interesting game 
 












#####

as someone who grew up on the zoo tycoon games and loved planet coaster frontier have released yet another amazing game planet zoo is not only super addictive to play but the game is visually stunning and comes with a beautiful soundtrack at first all of the zoo management will seem hella confusing so the devs were smart to add tutorials to the first few levels of the career mode which id recommend that everyone plays first 

theres still a few bugs here and there but im sure theyll be fixed soon unlike everyones hearts that wouldve exploded due to a cuteness overload from all the baby animals love this game 3

update 02042022 path system seems to be much improved

the path system in this game is so bad that it brings this game down from a 910 to a 510
i get so frustrated when playing that i have to quit and leave the game for weeks at a time
i want to love this game but i have to come to terms with the fact that i dont

id give them 50 bucks just to buildimplement a new path system from scratch

terrain to uneven for path error haunts me

some people may say  after a few hours of gameplay you will start to learn how it works and how to manipulate it to get it how you want or as close as possible
no you wont it makes no sense in fact the more you understand it the more problems you will find with it and the less sense it makes

it may be fine for you for a long time but then 20 hours into a zoo you will find that the whole thing collapses in on itself like a supernova and it will ruin your experience

#####

i isolated a gorilla in a 952 x 947 square foot concrete enclosure

#####

pros great detail to animals and overall graphics
cons somewhat complicated building

i loved the zoo tycoon series growing up and now i dont have a disk port to support it the closest to that was wildlife park but it just wasnt the same feel for me then this game got announced best graphics out there for sure lots of detail on not only the animals but the design of the zoo itself 

overall this game is wonderful to me 
however i do have some cons against it to put simply i think there should be simpler options building is really hard and sometimes things dont go together well and i have no idea how to fix it in this case i really liked the grid style of building from zoo tycoon it doesnt help that i am also a terrible architect so building the custom shops is very hard what i would like to see going forward is just some free buildings we can toss in and be ready its just a design it wont be bad to implement i think 
i liked the simplicity of zoo tycoon but i love all the attention to detail in planet zoo more

ive played this game since the year it came out and even now i enjoy it just as much if not even more so than i did then with over 300 hours into the game you would think that by now id have done everything but no i still feel like theres so much to do ive always loved animals my whole life and i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys creatingsandbox type games andor animals i grew up playing zoo tycoon 2 and would go out of my way to download tons of mods to make it as expansive as i could and this game brought those dreams of my younger self to life this game is excellent in a lot of different areas so let me go over what i enjoy

what i likeenjoyed
 the animals they are extremely well made with realistic appearances texture and are for the most part correct anatomically wise matching their real life versions there is a good variety in the base game as well as expansions some of which are better than others the animals are fun to watch with some of them having rare color variants you can get as well as a genetics system that adds a whole other dimension to them
 building although it can be a bit tedious when youre going for detail it is relatively easy to build things and the game gives you a lot of tools to create basically whatever you want because of this you can make your zoo as realistic or unrealistic as you want which i think is highly appealing and makes it super entertaining to a wide range of audiences on top of that the game has a steam workshop where there are all sorts of amazing builds and fences and building pieces made by the community that can be utilized
  zoo management although i have some critiques for the most part i like the management system in the zoos you need to be a little wise about what animals you start with in games where funds are involved as well as consistently checking whats going on within your zoo while you continue to expand you may need to go back to an exhibit and apply some contraceptives to prevent overcrowded animals its a little intimidating at first upon starting as well as occasionally later in the game if multiple issues arise but once you get past the learning curve i find it to be a somewhat enjoyable aspect although i know some may disagree
 regular updates at the time of this review the game is still changing and growing and i can say without a doubt that the updates have kept me interested i also really like the dlcs although there is definitely a range of opinions regarding them i enjoy creating exhibits for new animals ive never used before quite a bit and theyre arent a bad purchase when on sale over time in my opinion especially the well loved ones such as the aquatic pack

i have very few qualms with the game but i feel like they are worth mentioning

what i dislikedid not enjoy
 the game begins to slow down when you have too many guests and objects which really sucks if you want to build a massive zoo once my zoo reaches around 4000 guests everything begins to slow down because of this it is difficult to build massive zoos in franchise mode due to the lagginess although you can limit the number of guests it will reduce profit it really sucks because oftentimes i can only build zoos to a certain size before it becomes unbearable the only work around for this is play the zoo in a separate save as a sandbox zoo and closing the zoo so theres no guests which always reduces most of it ive looked this up before and it seems other people also experience it too which is unfortunate
 the franchise market although i love franchise mode the prices people are allowed to charge for certain animals is ridiculous its a freeforall and i remember starting out in franchise mode was really difficult as a new player because of it however i didnt follow any guides which likely wouldve earned me conservation credits quicker than my measly herd of pronghorn antelope did 
 the lack of difficulty i have put practically every zoo ive opened on hard difficulty and the reality is its just not difficult or at least it isnt for me i would always make more money than i spent even if i just had one species of animal ive never really found myself having to take out a loan or struggling financially in franchise mode i just think itd be neat if the hard difficulty was actually hard perhaps a hardcore mode is the challenge i seek

other than that its a great game i highly recommend it to anyone and everyone especially animal lovers or people who just like building things if youre on the fence about getting it buy it when its on sale its an easy game to dump hours and hours of time and dedication into with it only feeling like minutes and thats what makes it so great i will keep playing it for years to come and no game has inspired me to create quite like this one

#####

h1 seriously fun game to play thats also filled with bugs and other issues h1

h1i the fun parts of the game ih1

 customization i mean seriously you dont even need to be creative to play this game just let your imaginations run wild i usually do not bother with way too much customization options in games but this game changed my perspectives its just way too fun to design the zoo in your own ways theres ton of assets available for creative ideas
 workshop if you are lazy there are ton of items uploaded by creative players that will blow your mind and you can simply download these to use in your zoo
 simple gameplay very easy to learn and manage now it comes with difficulty settings so theres that
 animal variety
 animations are done really well
 huge map different biome settings to play with
 a lot of replay value
 graphics look very pretty

h1i the eh whatever ih1

 not really a huge fan of the franchise mode it requires you to have online connection for buying and trading animals from others and the pricing can sometimes be ridiculous but the game comes with a sandbox mode as well so you can play this mode instead if you are not into the whole market thing also the currency that is required to buy animals from the market isnt really hard to obtain once you establish your zoo you even get a few every time you go into your franchise in the main menu section
 the sandbox mode doesnt have much options

h1i the bad ih1

 buggy random bugs will occur ie staffs getting stuck the frequency of these bugs appearing however have gone down a lot due to updates but sometimes these would still show up in game
 mandatory crash moment after the intro will happen most of the time this was an issue since launch funny thing is during the beta testing the game never crashed when launching dont know what happened this never got fixed
 apparently the devs are releasing dlc when issues in game are nowhere near fixed in fact patches have known to cause more issues that many people are frustrated about to be honest the beta testing went way smoother for me than what we got after the launch of this game
 oh btw the game itself will randomly crash when playing sometime it doesnt happen sometime it does way too often i do have a decent pc that should be able to handle it

my personal rating 710

i wouldve given it a 10 but the issues mentioned in the game have ruined my experience so many times that i started losing my patience to play this however the gameplay is quite fun and i did enjoy playing it when it came out wait for a sale

#####

getting baked and watching gorillas climb around and poop all the time is the greatest joy in my life

#####

it is a complex and indepth zoo management game there is nothing not lo love about it

well except maybe some or  a lot of bugs crashes  and preformance issues which will make you pull your hair sometimes but if you have enough hair to endure it you certainly will love the game and i am sure the fixes will come

#####

its like zoo tycoon but on crack in the best way

#####

i started playing planet zoo back in january 21 and i had spent about 6 hours on it career mode before giving up i thought it was going to be an taxing and frustrating learning curve much like cityskylines 

i picked the game back up in november 21 and i havent been able to put it down especially with the sandbox mode its so much fun the animals are so enjoyable to watch and build for and you feel yourself actually making bonds with them caring for them and seeing how personable they are even though theyre just virtual animals

i love the options to make decorations and scenery for your park it does get easier with every update fix too  ive sobbed in happiness a fair few times at this game for many a reason i love the zoopedia and how it makes you realise that these fantastic creatures are at risk from being wiped out due to myriads of ecological reasons and of course capitalism the soundtrack is really hard to get bored of and is lovely you know what screw it im gonna say it

this is my game of the year i love it so so much 

if you love sim games love wildlife even love learning about flora and fauna relative to parts of our world get it 

i havent been disappointed yet x

#####

edit tried playing the game again after a month hiatus still seems to crash and i lose a lot of progress which is discouraging this time i tried to go from the construction tab to the habitat tab sorry aardvarks but i guess you will just have to live in an empty enclosure lol sending in the crash reports seems to do nothing

i love this game it brings back many memories of playing sim park and zoo tycoon 1 and 2 etc but there are so many bugs especially for the price of the game they are even releasing more paid dlc soon my game has crashed 7 times in under two hours now it is driving me mad i edit a group of objects and the game crashes i place some paths the game crashes i use the esc key instead of clicking the x in the menu window and the game crashes my pc doesnt have any problems with other games it even runs ark on ultra with a lot of mods with no problem planet zoo however is the first game that has ever given me this many crashes for no reason i can discern i still love this game but i really want the developers to fix the bugs and stuff before releasing a ton of paid dlc i do hope in the future i can change this to a positive review

#####

well ive now played over 600 hours so i think its time i finally write my review 

as many have previously said this game is the spiritual successor to zoo tycoon 2 if you like sim games and animals then youll love planet zoo opening with honesty i wouldnt really recommend this for casual gamers  there are premade buildings and habitats along with an engaging and wellwritten campaign but to really get your moneys worth you need to take advantage of the huge building potential of the game 

the base game provides endless opportunity to build whatever you can imagine the building tools are intuitive enabling you to be extremely accurate when you build along with the sets and textures looking wonderful foliage in this game is beautiful and really brings your habitats and zoos to life as well as a variety of which ill admit could be larger of rock pieces that look incredibly realistic pathing is a big issue with a lot of players of this game it can be incredibly frustrating at times when you have a vision in your head that you know is achievable but you just cant get right for the majority of the time though putting the time in and learning about the pathing system does help a lot

 now lets talk about the animals first of all they look fantastic and theyre all accompanied with sound designs and animations that make them feel and act real in terms of selection there is a massive choice especially when you factor in dlc some choices surprised me in a good way where we ended up with arguably lesserknown animals that i was pleased to see in the game i love crocodilians the dlcs include very popular choices that may be essential to your desired animal criteria but i believe most are worth the money 

all in all i still continue to have hours of fun on this game and i will continue to throw all my money at it until the very last dlc

#####

no otters still fun

jk has otters best game

even more otters better game

#####

this game is pretty good in so many ways the but the biggest issue is they could have done a lot more to the animals after you set up your zoo the way you want and guests happiness isnt an issue it just leaves you to endlessly breed your animals to continue being able to buy other ones so your habitat doesnt end up empty btw you can speed up time but its already moving so quickly for example each second is a day so your animals die pretty quickly 

all animals of their own species act the same no uniqueness about them other than their genetics like size of the animal immunity fertility longevity and some of them have slightly different color and you could have albinos which sounds really fun but after you have an endless superior genetic line you start to notice the dullness of the animals behavior like repeating the same animations over and over again for each thing they do like play socialize eat breed sleep etc

out of the 90 different types of animals in this game including the dlcs there are

 19 hoofed animals  dont get me wrong i love all animals its just hoofed animals in this game are a bit boring to watch in captivity if you go to a zoo in real life you bet your sweet potato fries youre gonna check out something like great apes or tigers or bears but the giraffes are an exception

 24 exhibit animals  which are in these small habitats they literally dont do anything no animations other than breathing and looking around literally dont even have a eating breeding and birth animation when they die they just disappear

so that leaves you with probably only 47 animals you might want to look through sounds like a lot and all but after about a month of playing the game can easily become dull and boring because youre constantly repeating the same things while your animals are repeating their same small amount of animations

i hope in the future they give them an ai behavioral update and allow them to look and act as fantastic as you would have hoped they do watching their beautiful planet zoo trailers

#####

the number one zoo builder out there

really nice graphics fun designs and lots of species to work with

lots of possibilities for enclosure designs n stuff

not a fan that 50 of this game has to be bought thru a dlc

710  chill fun but a little slow

#####

i suck at tycoon games like completely suck but i absolutely love them with a passion i played zt2 as a kid and when this came out i was instantly smitten a great way to kill time

#####

as of december this game is broken  you cannot connect to their servers and it will kick you every 5 minutes they are aware of it and have no solution as yet i am referring to the email they sent to me

#####

had a gorilla called harambe trapped a ton of guests in the gorilla cage out of all the customers and the 4 gorillas only harambe died great turnout at his funeral

#####

i love putting penguins with lions

#####

if youre like me and grown up with zoo tycoon 2001 and zoo tycoon 2 2004 youll most likely love planet zoo

pros based on my preferences only playing in sandbox mode
lot of varying species of animals even in the base game
beautiful graphics even if some animals are too stylized for my personal liking
huge creative freedom especially in sandbox mode
big steam workshop library where you can find new builds to use in your zoos
being able to share zoos easily with friends thus being able to work on the same zoo in intervals
updates periodically with feedback from players we didnt have flexicolor water at launch for example

cons based on my dislikes only playing in sandbox mode
high learning curve when it comes to building
path making is terrible and will at times work against you sadly
big animal hitboxes which can make your pretty builds be unusable despite looking like animals can fit
keeper ai is dumb thats honestly all keeper ai in every zoo game ive played

when we have quick personal pros and cons out of the way let me talk more about the game this game is honestly feels like a zoo tycoon that have matured and aged like i have it has advanced far from zt1 and zt2s simple make a habitat place animals place enrichment done the game is fun and as a creative building game it really shines and delivers big time cant sadly say much about the simulationmanagement aspect as i only play on sandbox it is a treat to build something even if its difficult at times as all buildings and such are made piece by piece but prefab and workshop blueprints really help with this and then see how the animals traverse and look in your habitat the way animals interact with items are adorable too for example do small ungulates picking up toys with their mouth and run around with them melt my heart and work on a level ive personally not seen animals do before in a game cutesy animals and creative freedom aside this game is just simply relaxing to tinker around with

the game can however be infuriating to work with and building and be difficult to learn at first even if you play the tutorials which i highly recommend or youll be completely lost and read all the help notes due to the way animal traversing works the game can get slow if you have big habitats or a lot of animals especially if you dont have a super beefy pc but the biggest enemy of all planet zoo players are the pathing system you will sadly find it infurating and annoying even when you think youve learned its quirks its ok to scream at the paths because the paths laugh at you while they make the obstructed pop up appear

rating  55

ive always dreamt of being a zookeeper nurturing majestic creatures and creating habitats that mimic their natural environments planet zoo without a doubt is the realization of that dream in digital form from the moment i embarked on my journey as a zoo manager ive been absolutely captivated by the breathtaking beauty and incredible depth of this game

planet zoo is a masterpiece in simulation gaming offering a rich and immersive experience that has kept me enthralled for countless hours the attention to detail in every aspect of the game is nothing short of astonishing the graphics are stunning with animals that move and behave with such realism that i often find myself just watching them go about their daily lives in awe

one of my favorite aspects of the game is the vast array of animals to choose from from majestic lions and graceful giraffes to quirky meerkats and playful red pandas the variety is astounding each species comes with its own unique needs and challenges which keeps gameplay fresh and engaging its not just about making money its about creating a haven for these creatures to thrive

building habitats is where planet zoo truly shines the construction tools are intuitive and flexible allowing for the creation of intricate realistic enclosures the game emphasizes the importance of conservation and animal welfare so designing habitats that cater to the animals natural behaviors is not just a goal but a necessity watching a group of elephants frolic in their spacious savannah habitat complete with mud baths and watering holes is immensely satisfying

but its not just about the animals managing staff researching new technologies and maintaining guest satisfaction are all integral parts of the game the sense of achievement when i see a wellrounded zoo where both animals and visitors are happy is incredibly rewarding

the community aspect of planet zoo adds another layer of enjoyment you can share your zoos online download other players creations and participate in challenges its a testament to the games replayability as theres always something new to explore or a fresh challenge to conquer

my own experiences with planet zoo have been nothing short of fantastic ive lost count of the hours ive spent perfecting my zoo learning about the animals and immersing myself in the world of conservation whether im meticulously adjusting a tigers climbing frame or marveling at the adorable antics of my penguins theres always something to keep me engaged and entertained

in conclusion planet zoo is a triumph in the world of simulation games its a lovingly crafted educational and visually stunning experience that offers endless hours of entertainment if youve ever dreamed of building your own wildlife sanctuary i wholeheartedly recommend giving planet zoo a try its a virtual safari that will leave you with a newfound appreciation for the wonders of the animal kingdom

this game is actually making me relive my zoo tycoon days where bengali tigers and springboks meet in the same enclosure

planet zoo offers you a massive variety of options to build and customize zoos across all continents and biomes it has a great variety of animals and its your job to make sure their habitats are adequate and that they have everything they need to be happy of course youll also need to take care of the needs of the guests of your zoo by making sure there are food and drink shops bathrooms and the like staff facilities are also important you should always take into account how far away they are from the animal habitats and shops to maximize the efficienty of your staff this makes for really fun strategic thinking as you have to take all these factors into consideration when planning out your zoo and it feels really rewarding once you build everything and see it all in motion

the presentation of the game is also fantastic the game looks beautiful and the animals in particular look great their animations are amazing and really faithful to their real life counterparts its a joy to watch them go with their lives eating and playing with the toys you place in their habitats this coupled with the games absolutely wonderful soundtrack makes for a really relaxing experience

its not only a game about taking good care of your animals but also about making your very own thing by landscaping and customizing buildings to the most minute details even if building entire structures may seem overwhelming at first the building tools are very good and you will get the hang of making a zoo that you can really call your own and in case you dont particularly care about making your own buildings the game comes with premade blueprints you can use and theres also fantastic steam workshop integration which lets you easily download and use blueprints uploaded by other players

an element of the game that was quite surprising for me was its career mode i was expecting a succession of outofcontext missions and objectives but theres an actual plot and characters and even voice acting great voice acting at that youll be playing missions in premade zoos as well as in zoos youll start from scratch trying to complete the objectives set by the characters of course the story isnt the main reason to play planet zoo but it serves its purpose to contextualize what you do in the career mode making it feel more engaging than it would be if the missions had no context to them whatsoever the interesting characters will keep you actively wanting to progress through the game and see whatll be next

this game is such an enjoyable experience for me that i can barely think of many negative aspects but a couple that come to my mind are
the pathing system can be very finnicky at times it can be hard to make paths exactly the way you want them to be especially when there are elevations and dont even get me started on the pain that is to make paths on slopes
franchise mode a mode where you trade animals online with other players has a very glitchy trade menu its slow and youll often have to click several times for a command to work heres a workaround tip if clicking doesnt work at first press enter instead of clicking a second time or play challenge mode which is pretty much franchise mode but offline without online trading and youll be fine
there is a glitch where animals will sometimes walk straight through habitat walls and the game will think theyve escaped and you need to capture them it doesnt happen often enough for it to be a big issue though
there is a glitch with the somewhat recent new type of staff that was added the educator and their item the talk point where the game will constantly give you a notification saying theyre walking too much and that the talk point is inacessible even though it is accessible hopefully this will be fixed with a patch soon

however the problems are very minor compared to all the pros of the game all in all planet zoo is a fantastic experience the game allows for a level of customization that ive honestly never seen in any other game of this kind the management aspects are fun watching the animals is relaxing the music is topnotch and the career mode is a ton of fun with its memorable characters

planet zoo is a zoo simulator with a strong emphasis on building this exact zoo and its micromanagement the game looks great and animals are super cute the ingame music is wonderful you start campaign mode in a premade zoo so you could learn some basics the interface is friendly and easy to use  i should mention great localization 

first 3 tutorial scenarios are fun to play and give you an idea of how to act in a given situation after that you have to rebuild your own zoo from scratch  its not that easy but doable and its a moment when the actual gameplay starts two hours passed quickly when i started making my first zoo it was more interesting than i expected but also uncovered a few flaws i worried about

the game is not flawless and some minor bugs are present for some reason the game freezes completely every time after launching for me seems like this happens because of the failed attempt to connect to the server no idea why though so i have to kill process and relaunch it some micromanagement details work weird for example ticket prices it seems like those could be bugged as another person mentioned 
the game is more complicated than it should be in some aspects ie duties of workers zones etc while too simplifiednot developed enough in more entertaining ones
planet zoo is also very resourse demanding so if your pc is worse than recommended one  think twice before playing it as your cpu might not be happy about that

planet zoo is an excellent zoo simulator that perfectly combines a huge amount of small details and ease of use its certainly better than jurassic world evolution was at launch and can catch your attention for dozens of hours as you will create your own zoo piece by piece a worthy pickup for fans of the genre and an interesting timekilling option for everyone else 810

sht everywhere

#####

this game is an absolute gem in the world of simulation and strategy from crafting intricate habitats to overseeing every aspect of your zoo its a journey that truly touches the heart planet zoo is an amazing simulation and strategy game where you create a world for wildlife its a masterpiece brought to you by the same brilliant minds behind planet coaster and zoo tycoon

recently they released a new dlc called the oceania pack it dropped in september and im obsessed with those adorable kiwis and tasmanian devils the attention to detail is mindblowing every time they release a new dlc they nail every cultural nuance

on a personal note i had the privilege of interviewing the amazing tamara tirják on open world videocast where i learned even more about the game the amount of love and care put into this game is unbelievable

planet zoo is a masterpiece i cant recommend it enough

#####

infinite creativity options when you play this game

#####

if you want to make a zoo this game is for you

#####

its good

#####

as a former zookeeper i love this game i appreciate all of the little tiny behaviors from all the animals even the small things like the giraffe ear flicks this game is very pretty and the most accurate zoo management game ive ever played

it is fairly indepth but i like that because there is always something to do this solves the issue with the old zoo tycoon games where you would sit around bored waiting for your money to regenerate there is a lot of stuff you need to manage that isnt money related genetics and breeding are great examples of this i am however nervous about the online animal market and how that will behave as the game becomes available for longer

#####

so ive had this game for a while 200 hours a while i obtained this game on release and occasionally do still play it if i want to kill time

i cannot in good conscience recommend this game many people familiar with frontier have already offered warnings for this game but after learning that some from the now defunct blue fang studiosthe ones who developed zoo tycoon2 i threw my hat into the ring to try it when i first started playing i was so excited and eager to play and make zoos based off of the ones ive visited for a while i had fun but as time went on the less and less interesting it became

i realized that there was a pattern and that the trailers are misleading make no mistake this isnt a game where you build a zoo and watch numerous animals interacting with their environment and each other this is a game where you build a park and you have to constantly and consistently wait on your guests hand and foot in vague hopes of them being happy and content if you dont place trash cans every 20m they throw trash on the ground or into your exhibits if the walls are low enough theyre never happy with any kind of food and drink service if it rains and they didnt bring an umbrella from home or buy one from an info shop  they get angry and start trashing the place no matter how many security guards or routes you have for this theyre terrible at doing their job caretakers are just as bad about keeping things clean work zones do not help this the only ones who work well with work zones are keepers

throughout most of the game i was having to manage guest happiness more than the care and wellbeing of my animals money was something i constantly had to pay attention to but i had to make nice with the guests who were complaining about being hungry when there were three open food stalls marked efficient right next to them at the food court or whining about how theres no trash cans when theres one within viewing distance of them i have friends who have worked in zoos and this is not how its like working there at all somehow guests can manage with less than five food courts irl why not here in zoo tycoon 2 the guests could handle having few food courts how has the ai somehow degraded to this point

the animals themselves have very limited interactions even though each animal has different ecology needs and desires they dont reflect this in the game all big cats move and act the same the only real difference between canine behavior is between awds and the timber wolvesits just the head motions they have the same play animations and everything and the majority of ungulates all behave the same for example bengal tigers are known for loving water but they rarely seek it out in game and for some reason would rather climb trees  when bengals rarely do this compared with other big cats why are lions so prone to climbing up structures when lions in the wild almost never climb trees thats the entire reason why leopards evolved to climb to get away from lions and to keep their food safe

and speaking of animals the very clear cash grab that was done with the dlc is ridiculous for 10 you can five animalsone of which is just an exhibit species and recolored scenery and then that continent is never touched again  completely ignoring the various wildlife and ecology of that region and primarily going for generic animals that they dont have to create new skeletons for the australia is the first pack theyve added any new variety but they still opted for yet another canis lupus species to be included as opposed to the many other australian creatures that are much less represented why not the platypus the quokka wombat

this game should be called planet build as the focus on animals is next to nonexistent and they expect you to pay 30 on dlc for 15 animals compare that to the games base price  and you see an issue arising why is this game so overpriced when the dlc all together comes that close to base game price but with fewer animals total with so little focus on the animals lack of animal interactions and absolutely garbage conservation protocol for a game that claims that its educational  why are pangolins so easy to obtain we dont even know how to breed them in captivity irl theres a grand total of one pangolin on display last i checked and a population of 40 in captivity worldwide but weve got a stable global population of reticulated giraffes bulls so they statistically shouldnt be harder to get than the critically endangered and poorly understood chinese pangolin makes for a game that i could not steer people away from faster the majority of my friends that bought this game with me have moved on to other games like jurassic world evolution or just stopped all together

the community itself is toxic if you try to criticize pz they get up in arms and yell about how youre entitled any dissenting opinion even if its just quietly requesting for more animals per dlcseriously if each pack was 30 and had 30 animals people would not complain you have people jumping down your throat for daring to criticize a company thats known for making cash grab games and preying on people in niche markets the subreddit is much more open to criticism and discussion but the steam community shuts down anything thats the opposite of what they like

save yourself the time and money get a different game or just play zoo tycoon 2 again

#####

this game makes me feel like i have a really big brain and it has cute animals

#####

i love this game let me start this off with that i love this game but i also hate it and its ruining my life allow me to explain

first the positives
this game is absolutely gorgeous the level of detail in everything from the animals to the plants to the environments of each biome you can build in combined with the sound design and the music it makes watching your animals frolicking around the habitats you built so damn relaxing
the gameplay in franchise mode is addicting and engaging it is mostly a numbers game but there is a motivation to create deh best zoo evar if nothing else for ocd purposes 

but now the things that make me want to start crying blood
the fucking construction system including the pathing system the fact that staff and guests need a path to move forward grinds my gears enough but very often the actual placing down of paths is as finicky as my cat as in it does not care what you want it will refuse unless its feels like you appreciate it enough
the actual building of well buildings i still have not wrapped my head around some of the amazing things people have created in this game because im still trying to figure out how to roof a goddamn taco stand at least i figured out that you can press z to automatically rotate an object without having to fiddle around the advanced move menu
power distribution in franchise mode i dont even care anymore devs just please let me check the power everything box in franchise mode it wouldnt even be so bad if the guests werent so offended seeing transformers placed every 100 yards but they are and because of that i suffer

and now my biggest gripe that above all else keeps me from being able to recommend this game until it is fixed 
this game advertises that is has authentic animals that think feel and explore the world you create around them when in actuality they have robotic cyborg animals controlled by a slightly advanced ai that throws a fit if theres a circle of long grass in a habitat for an animal from the desert all the while there is no sense of the animals having any form of personality other than having their own unique names and genetics they rarely have any unique behaviors that are only found in certain animals 

for example herd animals like zebra and elephants should actually try to stay together as a herd mothers and babies have no relationship whatsoever the baby pops into existence already practically a fully developed adult in some cases and is instantly like lol bye bye mom the parents dont seem to try at all to stay close to their babies they dont even go to a secluded place to give birth its just whoop im having a baby right now animals that have tight social bonds irl have 0 in this game and this might not bother some people and it might not be a problem at first but after a while seeing the same behaviors over and over and expecting nothing new having no attachment to your animals whatsoever because theyre just so robotic is what makes me bored of this game eventually 

i want to see elephants mourning when one of their own passes away i want to see animals and keepers develop bonds over time i want to see mother animals trying to protect their babies i want to see animals that have personality traits animals that might act spunkier than others making them play with toys more more aggressive which might cause guests to become afraid of them more shy causing them to look for places to hide more often i want to see actual baby animals grow and develop and not just be juveniles until its time for them to megaevolve 

until that is in the game i simply cant say that its 100 worth the money that is all great game but theres a lot of room for improvement

#####

the spiritual successor to zoo tycoon and zoo tycoon 2 if you loved those games you will love this one build intricate enclosures with all the design options all the while juggling the needs of your animals staff and guests most of which can even be turned off in sandbox if you want full creative freedom

#####

buildingdecor ideas are endless ive spent 40 hours and have no damn animals yet love this game however

#####

ive played planet coaster and jurassic park for so many hours there are some disappointments in planet coaster because of limitations and flaws and eventually i dropped it never played again but this planet zoo is a great come back worth every  ive spent including the dlcs are perfect for all ages all things i had frustrations with the planet coaster were fixed and improved in this game so much color activities and endless useful wikis about zoology subjects jammed packed with irresistible animations

planet zoo is not just for pure entertainment but also great for educational games storytelling family game activities with kids and live streaming for schools and higher education 

go and buy it and see it for yourself you will never regret playing this one i promise you that

#####

they have himalayan brown bear

#####

its a fantastic game but the keepers not feeding animals is a game breaking bug and really stopping any kind of immersion into the game this needs to change

#####

as the amount of hours ive played this game suggests i tremendously enjoy it i love the building aspect of it and the animal care aspect it is obvious frontier development has put a lot of love and effort in this project and continues to do so by updating the game regularly with new functions and new animals some of them even for free

#####

this game is really beautiful and if you like this type of game it wont disappoint at all  the animals look awesome and it is a really good modern take on the zoo tycoon formula

however i cant recommend this game in its current state for 2 reasons

1 time moves way too fast  i think an hour per year would be reasonable but we are currently looking at less than 20 min per yer  ive seen a lot of people asking for this to be changed but i dont believe the devs have said whether or not it will be

2 there are bugs right now that severely effect my ability to enjoy the game  i and many others are having issues getting the zookeepers to feed the animals which in turn seems to be resulting in them starving since there is no option to manually feed the dishes as there was in zt2 which was a wonderful feature that i wish pz had  im sure this will be fixed and its not too big of a deal to have some bugs on release



if the devs address these problems i would be happy to change this to a positive review because if not for this issues it really would be exactly the type of game people have been wanting to play since zoo tycoon 2

#####

i realy love this game not also because it enhances que real objective of a zoo conservationbut  has a fun atmosphere to it i studied biology and veterinary in the university thats way this game catched my eye so much i spend my days playing this game with a fulfilled gaming nerd that i am but knowing so much of this area it gives me some frustration  i know its a game but i hope you like some ideas i would love to give some sugestions and help to the developers

 investigation for the doctors parasites can be by biome or species cancer and other deseases because of old age or even genetic inbreeding deseases that ar not infecious females that reject theyre cubs a room to put them in this case a difficult birth and for that a observation room

 habitat  smell of ferohormones go see the oncelote cat they like perfumes that mimic the smell of females social enrichment some zoos use dogs in some cases like cheetas or for 
herbivores some farm animal

 animals embassadors  some captive animals are used to be embassadors of theyre species dificult captive species like the honeybadger and of course the wolverine  they are very dificult to have in captivity becuase of theyre adaptive nature and resiliance to stay there p  farm animals

 zoos  they also trade information about theyre breeding program some zoos are better at a unique species they do reports to share with other zoos  if asked or not theyre cubs will be more appealing to other zoos tour trips with clients medical waste

im sorry for bad english and i know you cant please eveyrone but its only a few ideas i never posted anyting about a game on steam but this particular game made me do it thank you so much for making this game is awsome and addictive

best regards for the rest of the comunity

#####

if you like animals and planet coaster this game is perfect for you

#####

monke 

#####

i love this game and i just bought two new packs got penguins

#####

i havent felt truly addicted to a game in years this game brought back that feeling can recommend 

#####

i grew up playing zoo tycoon and this game is like that and soo much more i have been obsessed with this game since its announcement of coming out i would totally recommend this game to anyone

#####
















#####

i cant believe how many hours ive put into this but the truth is that planet zoo is very fun creative and above all very relaxing very strong recommend if you like management andor building games  animals obviously

1010 im sure we can all agree that baby elephants and wolf cubs are cute as heck

#####

honestly at first this game is not what i expected and i wanted to refund it because i felt though having an array of animals to have in your zoo it just wasnt zoo tycoon i miss the aquatics 

but im just assuming they will release those things later on 

as ive spent more and more time on the game i am absolutely loving it i cant get enough especially with the ups and downs in franchise i dont have the creative abilities like most do when it comes to imagining however im getting there and expanding 

so if you want a game to pass the time and look at cute animals and have a fun time building enclosures this is definitely that game

#####

zoo tycoon turned up to 11 so many features and so much attention to detail great game that will consume so much of my life

#####

i had to install 32 heaters in my tundra zoo just to keep my 27 lemurs from dying in the cold 

also the game needs janitors because no one has any respect for my zoo 
theres literally 100 trash cans but my guests seem to prefer littering 
 
1010

#####

so steam is asking me  would you recommend this game to your friends  and i say  yes but

lets have a look at it 
i dont know how about you guys but games from frontier developments have been in my life quite awhile zoo tycoon lostwinds and of course rollercoaster tycoon so the moment i heard about planet zoo i was very excited 

at the begining you can choose where you want to start or you can be rebel and just jump into franchise mode and figure out most of the stuff needed to know to properly run hecking zoo but if youre someone who likes to take it slow and challenge yourself a bit  i recommend to finish career mode first or you can just play sandbox mode without money and resources restrictions and build whatever you want  like one day i got bored and played pit of death yeah its really what it is 10 animals only one winner no i dont feel any shame at all  but i believe normal people would build some spectacular zoo for sure  

so planet zoo yeah
you are responsible for building and maintaining a functioning zoo and ensuring not only that its animals are well looked after but also that the business turns a profit
theres nothing stopping you from creating incredible zoo 
every little detail affects you your customers and of course animals to make sure they have the right ammount of food animals i mean but when i think about it customers can be hangry too hah you have to give them just right ammount of what they need is the best way to put it then watch them beeing happy and money coming in and let me tell you when theres baby panda or baby wolf running around and you just spectate them being all happy and fluffy yea thats when im greatful for this game 

and here comes  but 
everyone who remembers playing rollercoaster knows what pain in the ass was pushing through growing park the ammount of lag and game crashing and thats where i feel planet zoo fails as well its alright till you have around 3k visitors but the more youre adding building upgrading habitats and have more animals the more of lag you get fair enough not many people push through bigger zoo plans but i can see why 
for me the issue begins whenever i start the game it crashes most of the times on different occasions its like russian roulette 

and another minus is certain building tools you can have these huge and briliant ideas but you cant really make them work due to what youre given paths were the biggest pain for me to make them work i swore to odin i will just alt  f4 also power and water placement is very important and very unfortunate for the happiness of your customers and when these engines are too close to where they see them theyre unhappy but if the water cleaning station isnt in radius of water for your animals then the water is dirty  animals sick  customers unhappy etc you see its challenge sometimes i admit that and i like challenges hence i would really welcome more varieties of power generators etc 

speaking of more variety 
id be really surprised if frontier wouldnt give us any dlc id be super excited about anything but what i am missing is marine animals or even random picks from tropical fish jellyfish etc to spice up the dark corners of my zoo 
also more options of shared habitat not only for zebras and giraffes because there is much more animals species living together for example crocodiles and plovers tarantula and frog bears and wolves usually in nature bears simply ignore wolves they evolved together well yeah tried that in my zoo didnt go well rip alejandro 

50 hours in and this game keeps me enterteined and happy i am sure developers will keep updating and fixing problems 
i also admire how much work and detail was put into animal animations thats one huge plus 
so there you have it if youre still thinking whether you should or should not buy this game id say you wont regret you know i just remember what my friend told me about this game its like having a hamster
heck youre so happy to have it you keep looking after it cherrish it it keeps you awake at night and youre loosing your god damn mind when its not well but you couldnt give it up for the world d

final rating
810

#####

solid game that keeps getting better but the building can be finnicky and annoying at times

#####

i am providing this review for those casual players that think you will be able to pick it up and build the zoo that you visualise in your minds eye this is not that game 

i have downloaded many other peoples structures and zoos and they are quite lovely the problem starts when i try and build my own the game mechanics are not intuitive and if like me you enjoy a beer or two while playing it gets even more complicated read confusing really quickly 

this game is complex and extremely deep in detail meaning you need to spend an extraordinary amount of time learning just the basics

sadly i dont have the time to learn how to play it fully and therefore it will be added to my list of games that i will never play again

the reason for this review is more to warn any casual players to really consider the purchase of this game more so than a negative review as that would be unfair given the quality of the game 

if you have the time and the will to learn then i am sure you will enjoy endless hours building many wonderful creations 

if you have the attention span of a gnat like me or real life time restraints this is probably not the game for you 


#####

i think the game has a bunch of potential to be super fun and i love the creativity of building without many limits however the fact that the rare updates are always new packs that make you have to spend more money for very little add on is sadly a huge disappointment for me for some of us we cant just throw money out every time a few new animals are released and i think its a bummer that unless you can you dont get to play with the new creatures just turned me off from the game as it seems its only out for more and more money

#####

its a good game worth the price if you had some dlcs
theres tons of animals to explore with but theres problems with every game

the continents for every park is all the same size but some feel smaller due to the terrain
for example the oceania park has water surronding it and some small hills which make it slightly harder to make buildings on them

the worst problem is the size of the habitats you have to make it very large if its not large enough then protesters are gonna come to your zoo protesters lower your star rating with animals and they make it hard for people to come to the 
zoo why not just ignore the large size of the habitats you have to make it takes a large amount of space i can only fit like 57 animals in my zoo if its that size you wont be able to put more shops and merchandise

overall the games good but just know some things
lastly i want to tell you about the animals the elephants all hate glass replace the glass barriers  in there cage with eletrical fences or they will escape the habitat making all your customers leave
be mindful of how much of one gender you put in a habitat 2 boys and 2 girls or even 2 boys and 1 girl make them fight over the girls which make injurys 
read this before you buy save your park before you leave the game or go to the main menu it will get rid of all your changes you have made todayhow long you have played it today dont be fooled on the customers happy faces dont make it a all snow park they will complain that it is cold ex tundra biome taiga  the best biomes you can choose for your zoo is temperate and grassland just be mindful if you want to make a snow habitat ex snow leopard polar bear etc add coolers in the cage first then add snow if you just spread the snow its gonna dissapear because its not classified as cold yet add bins if you dont obviously people are gonna litter all over your park same with benches there gonna get tired of working

staff problem dont add like 20 zookeepers or mechanics of any job unless your prepared you will need a lot of staff rooms or theres just gonna be a bunch of problems
any other problems you want to know just ask somebody that plays planet zoo or search it up on google

does this save my bank detailslocation no it does not once you buy the gameany dlc it will ask for your credit card info but then once you have made the purchase it gets rid of the info


#####

i am trying really hard to like and enjoy this game because it is a very nice game but every time i boot it up and attempt to play the building controls especially the path ones drive me crazy they are not easy to use and i find them very restricting on more than one occasion ive quit the game after only a brief time playing because man i just want to build a zoo not fight with building a damn path 

update 73 tried to play again after a loooong time not even touching the game watched some youtube tutorials could not build a straight barrier for my habitat to follow a path this games buildingpathing controlsmechanics are terrible and not user friendly i should not have to play the game for 200 hours before finally getting to understand the controls why is there no option in the barrier section to build a straight barrier why must i fight with the game to get a barrier that goes in a straight line not at an angle incredibly disappointed i really really want to love this game but it seems that the game is designed to fight against anything you want to do

#####

i killed them all

#####

this annoying game lets you forget time extremely addictive at least worth a shot

#####

avoid franchise mode or youll pull your hair out from the frequently broken marketplace 

#####

you learn alot about the animals and its relaxing

#####

free cat petting one like for one time
免费摸猫猫一个赞摸一次













#####

a really nice way to relax while also learning about animals and their habitatscare
i used to play zoo tycoon as a kid and this game although way more involved and intense gave me that same comfort and enjoyment back it can be hard to learn and understand at first i recommend spending some time just playing in the sandbox mode until youre more comfortable
the improvementscommunication and updates make the game enjoyable i wish the paths were a bit easier to handle
