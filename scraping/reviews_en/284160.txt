choose map  choose car  go fast  crash  repeat

#####

i saved my car from sliding off the expressway irl because of this game

#####

the safe way to drink and drive

#####

this game has everything from roleplaying to destroying cars and making havoc this game is a banger  
for every like this review gets i will give a copy of this game for free

#####

i have committed war crimes using a 2001 honda civic

#####

this game really makes me wanna crash my car in real life and see if the physics match up

#####

ive had it since it released on steam day 1 and have accumulated 3700 hours to date i think i can safely recommend it 

it scratches my senseless destruction itch in so many ways

edit 2022 i have probably another 2000hrs on top of that total now but since i launch beamng through the beammp launcher to play online and race others it doesnt accumulate playtime sadly

all this to say get the beammp multiplayer addon

#####

no matter how far i drive i cant out drive my loneliness

#####

recreating my car crash in beamng to relive the experience 1010

#####

life is the best beamngdrive simulator

i am currently a traffic crash investigator for a sheriffs department in the us not only is this game fun it has the potential to be a great tool in the field of traffic crash reconstruction the physics engine hands down is very close to the real thing part of my job consists of taking real world crash data reconstructing and mathematically remodeling crash and vehicle dynamics that said not only is this game simulator really extremely fun it has the potential down the road to aid law enforcement in the reconstruction of fatal crashes similar programs that take raw physics data and convert them to 3d renderings such as this one can go for upwards of 50000 although beamngdrive is not to the level of forensic software it could be with some tweaking and insight

i highly recommend this title and i cant wait to see what future updates hold there are some bugs but this isnt the full game and is to be expected

to the developers  consider speaking with a consulting firm in crash reconstruction to get the correct formulas equations etc and you could possibly license a professional version which could spell big money some type of mode to enter real world vehicles manipulate vehicle weights be able to place them on a road at certain angles and certain speeds etc would be awesome i can tell you already that the game in its current state will yield crash results in the same ballpark very close to the real world


#####

i practice wrapping my car around a telephone pole in this game so that when i do it irl on my drive in to work i make sure to do it right

#####

spawn car spawn traffic get drunk text and drive rear end someone learn how to fly for 5 seconds die
 game of the year 

#####

i fix cars and trucks during the day and crash them in beamng drive at night would recommend

#####

ive been driving for well over 20 years now and ive never gotten myself into an accident
20 years of uneventful driving just cruising along always watching out for other drivers and reacting

so imagine my sheer glee at the amazingly destructive power in beamngdrive ive been playing for a long while now and it still never gets old ive driven myself off cliffs smashed into guardrails and decided to see what happens when you do get into an accident

beamngdrive is basically like my playground that lets me do all the bad things that ive always avoided in the past 20 years of bad driving i get to smash and mob around like an absolute loon chuckle and nod at the destruction and then do it all over again

theres also apparently other modes other than freeroam which ive played a few times and are loads of fun buuuuuuttif youll excuse me i need to see what happens when i take a 3 wheeled unstable vehicle over jump

biggest tips for new players who may be bored quickly explore the menus beamngdrive is more than just crashing cars by exploring every single menu and sub menus inside of those menus on the sidebar you open up a lot of possibilities from changing almost every component in your car to making awesome replays a bit of roleplaying and setting up car chases
tip #2 learn the shortcuts for menus and vehicle controls you can do this via google or even exploring the controls menu
tip #3 watch youtube videos to get some ideas what to do maybe from ybr or mighty car vids and muye
tip #4 with beam mp you can play online multiplayer with other people
tip #5 dont underestimate the scenarios for entertainment
bonus tip not all mods are on the in game mod repository be it theyre not ready for a full release or for copyright reasons they cant be included there are tons of extra mods on beamngdrives official website

congratulations if you got this far either you read the whole thing or just came down here to you know maybe give me an award jk 3

this game is the best driving simulator i know 
why you ask
well first there is the soft body physics which are very similar to a real car that means if youre rallying and you want to cut the corner and hit a rock with the suspension instead of the wheel you will break your suspension oh dont worry you can still finish but youll have to suffer the consequences of your decisions or you can restart the scenario and try again with a fresh car to get a clean run as the youtuber jimmy broadbent said in beamng compared to so many other racing games the car actually feels like an object you have to look after

secondly there is the sheer amount of fun stuff you can do with this game like dirt rally tarmac rally track racing drifting derby off road drag or simply just cruising in a comfy road car at comfy speeds there is a career mode i have tried a little and intend to look into more with nice fun challenges that are not conventional of your typical racing sim there are a lot of scenarios you can choose from like classic dirt rallying i really love dirt rally and its really good in this game police chases cool stunts like in movies deliveries races some light and breezy and some very challenging and sooooo much more i have played 20 hours so far and havent even remotely scratched the surface of this games content 

the maps in this game are very impressive my favorite is italy a highly detailed and very huge map of a countryside in italy with very long serpentine roads that go through the mountains and seaside with three cities to explore and drive in and countless dirt and gravel roads to put your rallying skills to the test there is industrial site where you can practice your drifting rallycrossderby there is east coast usa where you can cruise on the highway and make cool police chase scenarios 

there is a photo mode in which i have made all of my most recent desktop backgrounds

on top of all that there are a lot of mods that can add to your driving experience and the devs are super supportive of them even so that they made most of them accessible on their website and in game you can download maps components for your cars new cars and so much more i recommend getting the nurburgring map mod you can find it in the repository under the name ks_nord its a super realistic free and scanned map of the legendary nurburgring circuit in the nurburg area in germany most of the fanmade mod maps in this game looked really good to me and its fun to see such a loving and passionate comunity in a racing game also look up beammp which is a multiplayer mod for the game it is being constantly looked after and updated by their creators and so far i find it really fun doing some roleplay with people racing and cruising

anyway i could go on about this but id rather play the game instead see ya

#####

i killed a family a five with my lambo

#####

drove into a wall


#####

satisfying until you crash into something then it becomes another kind of satisfying 

#####

definitely something that 6 year old me wouldve enjoyed which means on the inside im still a 6 year old

#####

driving off cliffs is therapeutic

#####

im a simple man i see car go boom and it makes me happy

#####

this really isnt just a hurrr car go crash sort of game on the surface it may look as so but the customization of this game is topnotch no other game comes anywhere close the amount of parts and tuning you can do is astonishing and theres so many varied options across so many different cars

what has me sold is the car handling get a gamepad or a wheel itll elevate the experience substancially the handling is beyond superb and hard to master once you do though no other car or racing game comes close every other game will feel archaic and clunky and honestly just utter garbage this game has spoiled me and left me honestly surprised at how much value and hardwork went into a relatively inexpensive game the developers in my personal opinion have made singlehandedly the most realistic and accurate depiction at how cars genuinely are

also get the multiplayer mod nothing really hits quite different than joining a police chase server and having highspeed chases with real people

#####

if my 6000 and counting hours on this game doesnt already say it read this

this is a simulator not only that an acurate one it requires a good computer to run most of the time but its so worth it if you like driving breaking things or wondering around aimlessly in vast and detailed maps in a car then this game is for you

super fun  after finding out about this i went on a search to find any free games that could do what this thing could do  nothing  then i took off the free filter and still nothing compared this game is a true simulation of physics and it does it extremely well and accurately  the next best thing would be rigs of rods but even that doesnt come anywhere close to the power and freedom you have in beamng  highly recommended

originally i had wrote a 25page essay explaining my review of beamngdrive after 2000 hours i later found out that steam actually has a character limit on reviews so im going to have to summarize it

as of version 021 beamng outclasses every other game ive played including those that arent car games in controller support player control mod support and simulation depth
currently the base game lacks a main objective shader quality and global optimizations but it is still in development and based on its track record it will continue to improve with every update
i really wish i could post my entire review about the game here but i guess the final paragraph will be good enough

so in conclusion beamngdrive is still very much in earlyaccess but it has improved vastly from what it used to be and continues to improve with every update almost every aspect about beamngdrive is much more advanced than anything else on the market even with the odd unfinished game thing here and there because of that and despite all of its flaws id strongly recommend anyone who is into cars and who has a pc powerful enough to run it to give it a try there are small things here that make it so beamngs simulation is not quite perfect but that being said it is still the most indepth automotive simulator that you can buy today

drunk driving simulator

#####

for all the guys that say beamng is empty and without content i have to say your imagination is empty and without content as a child i used to play with my toy cars and i made up huge crashes and everything blew up in my fantasy and beamng is like the virtual playground i always wanted to play in you can choose a stereotypical type of car which you can tune and customize as you wish and make up huuuuuge crashes with the most realistic deformation i have ever seen in a real time simulation i can not suggest this game enough to people that always wantet to know how it looks when a semi truck rear ends a traffic jam or how it looks when you crash your sports sedan with 180 mph into a static object i love this piece of art and its my favourite game here on steam you can always jump in and drive a few hours and i will promise you that you will smile at some point

#####

beamngdrive is a very physicsheavy simulation utilizing torque3d and a very accurate realistic softbody physics engine what does this mean for you however this game provides stunningly realistic vehicle deformations much like rigs of rods which beamngdrive is based off beamngdrive tries to be the most accurate vehicle damaging simulator and it is succeeding while it is still only in alpha i strongly recommend picking this up if youre like me and find pleasure in smashing pickup trucks into small japanese compact cars

if you wish to own this title you can order a steam alpha key at their website httpwwwbeamngcom

i play this game sometimes its great

#####

when i first downloaded this game a few years ago i only had a gamepad and i just didnt get it i didnt take the time to set up the controller and didnt really understand what the game is but i love driving games particularly rally sims  rbr dr20 wrc9 and physics simulations so i spent a few hours on it and figured id revisit later after quarantine started i got a wheel so naturally tried every driving game i own with it beamngdrive was by far the biggest surprise and has quickly become one of my favorite games most of the cars handle as id expect and i was impressed by the force feedback

it took a couple mods to get me addicted pseudo random tour seems like a perfect mod for this game and shows off how much content and potential there really is here but as a rally fan what really got me hooked was the pace notes mod pace notes core and the configuration  suddenly its a rally sim and in my opinion a really solid one finally we have a game where the physics feels right cars handle believably and damage is realistic enough to make every risk a calculation i dont really know how driving on tarmac compares to other games but if youre into dirt rally wrc or rbr id definitely recommend checking it out the offroad experience is exactly what id been wanting

my only fear is that it could be hard to market a game like this and grow an ecosystem around it this is a fantastic physics platform just begging to have a deeper game experience built on top of it and i really really hope they can create that ill be doing time trials in utah until then

edit im using a t300 rs gt with the sparco r383 rim

#####

oh where to start i backed this game in 2014 on kickstarter and when it came to steam i got a key i couldnt tell you how happy i was to finally play the game aaand ive never put it down since i lost internet for awhile so i played it offline a ton because at the time it was the only game i had installed so instead of 1300 hours i probably have more like 3000 its got the best crash physics of any game made suspensions is simulated stupidly realistic there are ton of modifcations you can do to the vehicles within the game that make them handle different or faster and recently  with the tire update this is probably one of the best feeling games you can get on a wheel other than iracing im telling you if you dont own this game please buy it its worth every penny of its price if youre a gearhead like me and enjoy hotrodding and playing with cars

#####

ah beamng probably one of the hardest games to write a review for with the vast amount of stuff this game offers like driving cars this game has cars it also has trucks theres also a van and a piano theres also a functional cannon

 like crashing cars  you can do that whether you chuck it off a cliff slam it into a tree crash it into another car or yeet it  into a destructible brick wall youre almost always to get realistic results each and every time

 like driving you can drive sometimes at over 300 miles per hour you can also drive at many places including but not limited to italy utah the us west coast the us east coast and a flat grid you can also make your own places to drive though its a pretty complex process 

not satisfied with the standard game you can get mods including custom vehicles such as dog reallyreallyreally tall van big tires and a foam block wall there are also mods that add new places to drive to the game such as really long highway ski jump designed for cars and a couple of maps that cant really be described using text

worried the game wont run on your system alright thats actually a reasonable thing to be worried about this is a very hardware intensive game but it can run on rather lowend devices albeit poorly chances are if your setup is from 2014 or later you can probably get 45 fps at most maps

at the end of the day this is a really fun vehicle sandbox game id recommend it to anybody who likes cars or games with really good destruction physics

#####

crash physics in this game are like no other way ahead of the competition if there even is any xd highly recommend

i have over 900 hours on this game and i can say it is for sure worth downloading

#####

ever since purchasing this game a few years ago every time this game gets a update it becomes even better for the price you get many hundred of hours of fun

this game however is highly focused on freeroam which means creating your own fun this may put some people off 

this is one of the few games that will leave you begging for one of the highquality updates

to be honest i couldve typed this review up years ago when i got this but i never knew how to make a review but im here now and im doing this okay here we go
the goodakaeverything
cars go crunch here so you dont have to crash irlthough i know that wont stop all of you
great cars and maps with nice little details
an incredible modding community theres and endless supply of content coming out all the time from hardworking individuals all so we can take your masterpieces and turn them into heaps of scrap
the badakawhat bad
this is on me but it can get a little boring as your mostly just crashing cars there are so challenges to do in game and there are so many things you could do but i guess i dont have the imagination to do that like i said this is bad on me no fault of the game
game is really graphics heavy so a higherend pc is recommended nothing too fancy but ram and gpu are hardest hit maybe processor tooim not that smart with tech but this isnt truly bad as you probably already have good spec if youre looking to play a physicsheavy game
load times they used to be bad but theyve gotten considerably better in recent updates but the more mods you get the more itll have to load a good pc should be able to handle it but just keep this in mindi have 100s of mods and its not too bad
and well thats it sorry this it so long one of my first reviews after all but this game deserves to looked at in detail if you play it once youll come back to it here and there to have more fun so in short i highly recommend this game
if you read this far thank you so much i tried my best here

#####

holy wow i recreated the death of my best friend 1010

#####

when i first saw the game it was nothing more than a softbody tech demo for the cryengine but
i was interested enough to buy the game once it was announced
after all this time i never got tired of the game this is thanks to the continuing development and striving mod community 

if you ever wondered what a small italian twoseater with a 500 hp american v8 would become after it met a wall at 120mph wonder no more and try it out yourself

definitely a recommendation for all racing and sandbox enthusiasts

edit after adding an additional 100 hours this still holds true both the developers and the community keep supporting the game and adding vehicles maps and missions the next big step for the game will be its story mode which is currently playable as a prerelease test

#####

one of my all time favorite games one of the best things about the game is the devs not a single one of there updates has disappointed and it seems like every one is better than the one before it you can really see the effort the devs put into the game another great thing about is the amazing mod support super easy to find and download mods the only thing the games need to be perfect now is muiltiplayer 

#####

its just an amazing game that you rarely get bored of i have 300 hours on this game and i am here to say 
this game is worth the money

#####

great game get to recreate my uncles death with the same realism

1010

#####

honestly this game is my dream game because of whybeare and i certainly never regretted purchasing it since 2017 such a relaxing game to drive yet if you crashed it would be so satisfying oh yeah dont forget to download the beammp mod for multiplayer its the best mod ever ever so yeah dont hesitate to buy its such a brilliant game

#####

step 2 piegon fall piegeon moment

step 3 laugh

#####

having just realized i have 1000 hours of total gameplay on beamngdrive i think its best to write a detailed description as to why this game is so amazing 

first off the physics themselves are outstanding this is pretty much as realistic as it gets regarding vehicle physics and dynamics without using modifications this game only has a limited number of vanilla game maps but endless ways to be creative and have fun drive on different maps install mods that better improve gameplay  just have fun i seriously love this game im on it about 23 times a week usually 

updates are fairly uncommon but when they are released the updates have a lot to offer granted some updates were just downright ridiculous and hated by me and other community members they have most always fixed their game problemsbugs within the following week or so the developers are seriously so dedicated to their role at advancing this game to the next level i will admit some changes are not worth it to me but that it me overall this game is awesome 

one of my favorite parts about this game is that they allow and make it easy for users to create community mods able to be installed even while ingame yes there are some offsite mods for realistic vehicles but we wont go there anyway the fact that they allow users to release their creations makes this game just that much better there are so many modifications that you can install to your liking most of them are great 

in summary this game is great it was and is cool to see the progress that they have made from when they started out to what it is now keep up the great work devs and make sure to keep listening to your community on both positive and negative feedback its what makes a good game not many gave devs listed tocare about their community

theres no way im not autistic

#####

you can download a car

and then turn it into an unrecognizable scrap heap

#####

many a time has car gone vroom and then boom

#####

motion blur is disabled by default 1010

this game is actually 1010 not for that reason alone though lol it is an amazing sandbox physics game as well as an amazing driving game you can either mess around and destroy vehicles or do serious racing with other people online using a mod if you plan on racing in this game though i bhighlyb suggest using a pc steering wheel or at least a controller you can get away with using keyboard controls when youre just messing around with the physics but if you ever want to win a race youll need more than that

i definitely recommend getting beamng whether you want to play around with the physics or do some competitive racing both are excellent in this game

#####

good game to play if pissed off

#####

very nice game its realistic you can free ride go offroading race and even download a multiplayer mod

#####

car go boom

#####

sharp left sharp left samir listen to me samir youre breaking the car

there is no other game that you can spend hours customizing your car just to turn around and obliterate it in every way imaginable

1010 would wreck again

crashed into a pregnant woman

#####

car go vroom and kaboom

#####

i recomend it should have multiplayer


#####

car go fast and crash hard 1010

#####

played it for a few minutes not bad

#####

this game is missing one thing multiplayer

#####

pros crash
cons crash

#####

im only making a review because steam is asking me too but i dont think ive played enough to really review the game yet but its fun

#####

all the youtubers out there say oh the driving sucks 

no the driving is realistic

people buy this game for the crashing and whatnot but this game also works fantastically as a driving game being able to learn a tack or a certain road is extremly rewarding once you learn all the specific turns corners and little bumps 

plus when you eventually mess up it also crashes realistically  making every part of this game very satisfying 

i have put well over 250 hours into this game and im not stopping any time soon

beamngdrive is a successor to rigs of rods the game itself is two steps ahead other games in terms of realistic vehicle simulation and its softbody physics so thanks to this its unique driving cars is easy just press w but controlling them is a whole different story disabling automatic clutch gearbox safety and playing on a manual gearbox using a steering wheel makes the game a lot harder to play but thats the fun here tuning cars especially with mods is really fun and rewarding once you master it ive never seen a game with this much car tuning capabilites so that makes it stand out among others mods make the gameplay 10x better as there are infinite possibilities to play the game for now there are only short scenarios and freeroam that can get boring after some time but a career mode is in the making since the game is in early access the game in its current state is really fun asis and it will continue to expand in the future the devs are updating and hotfixing the game frequently so that is a big plus also i hope beamng will get optimised more and more because rendering and calculating physics is really cpu intensive so playing with more than 12 cars will drop your framerate especially on big maps like west coast usa overall if you like cars you need to play this game its really fun once you get into it

#####

before i played this i had a small penis no girlfriend and no will to live none of these things have changed but the game is pretty good

#####

car go vroom and do fun

#####

300 hours playing this game
it just keeps getting better and better
after upgrading memory and graphics card to 32gb ram and radeon 6700xt this game is now runs as smooth as ever
endless fun endless freedom and endless creativity
this game has everything that ive ever wished for when i was a child

it is a must have period

i remember back in the day that i got to know the potential of this game and i was and still am a big fan of it and ive asked the developers how can i contribute to the game do they have some donation options i want to make sure this game will still be developed and will not be abandoned like so many games today with so much potential
the devs answer we must first keep our promises to the people that bought our game
when was the last time youve heard such honesty and humble from a game developer
this goes to show that these guysgirls are well worth supporting and backing

again if you like racing games with fun racing scenarios and unique and stateoftheart  one of a kind physics engine with endless freedom active community with lots of contributors and mods buy this game now

thanks to the devs for this absolutely gem of a game

#####

very entertaining even after 9000 hours on it

i swore that i would eventually own this game when i first saw it on youtube back in 7th grade 6 yrs later i finally could afford to build a pc and play it it is everything i have ever wanted

ive become a pretty harsh critic of driving games and sims over the last few years  i want everything to be as close to real life as possible in the driving experience if something labels itself as such and beamng drive has taken my breath away and reeled me in probably never to let go

there are still some issues that the devs are constantly working on and improving nitpicking and serious such as simulated tirewear paint simulation and the controller integration isnt exactly the best but judging the game on the basis of what it advertises beamng drive sees no equal  the literal eons you could spend in this sandbox doing whatever you can think of with hunks of metal moving at speed is unthinkable  i wont bore you listing what you can do everyone else can do that for you but ill just say that this game puts a smile on the face of a guy who finds even the most minor faults in driving sims and thats whats important to me

update the scintilla content update has only strengthened my sentiment towards this game  the amount of effort and quality being put out from such a small team for free is absurd  i cannot sing this games praises high enough

#####

car

#####

how to drive properly in beamngdrive

get a car
drive the car
crash the car
reset the car
tune a bit
crash again
then repeat

1010 the best physics engine

#####

great game 
perfect for people who like destruction

#####

probably the greatest car driving and crashing simulator ever made

positives
 large modding community
 multiplayer games
 regular updates even 6 years after release
 easy ingame car modifications  layout
 realistic enough to improve your understanding of cars
 hyperrealistic physics engine
i could go on these are the substantial pros more minor pros include a technical readout for your active vehicle huge controls list and ui guide and good tutorials both ingame and online

negatives
 interface continues to feel annoying and slow
 fairly demanding specs to run well  with ai
 some of the developer included missions feel unfinished and sloppy
 seems to have a much bigger problem with fake mods that are trojansviruses online than with other games but this is avoidable using the ingame repository
 takes a long time to perfect the controls especially with a keyboard

for what it does have this game is fantastic i want to also reiterate that this is the only carracingcar physics based game i actually have it proves to be and always has been a game of the highest echelon

2021 edit was to fix the grammar and make it less unreadable

#####

if you are looking for a very realistic game that involves testing smashing driving and just about anything else that has to do with vehicles youve come to the right place 

the developer of this game has exceeded all expectations and you will not be disappointed the simulator provides unsurpassed physics that will be candy to the eye 

as i right this review after totaling 1000 hours of game time i can say this is my favorite game and will continue to play for many more hours

#####

car fell apart

#####

great game
endless fun even without a gaming wheel
you will have to run the game on minimum graphics settings doesnt look that bad if you have a potato computer like me if it freezes do not xout hit altf4 or it will confuse the game launcher and risk deleting progress

#####

by far the most fun ive ever had in a driving game countless mods 10 times more fun with a wheel and shifter set up

#####

car go vroom vroom

#####

nice game ive put a few hours on it and it still has more to offer i would like to see more rhd cars and maps

#####

a review is nothing if it isnt helpful so lets get down to brass tacks at the moment you should know beamng is not a game  its at best a sandbox title with most of the necessary content missing  its far better to say at the moment that its a game engine looking for a game  but what a game engine 

the content as it stands offers you the chance to drive round a handful of locations  thanks to johnny3600 who points out that this game uses torque3d as an engine not the cryengine as i first thought though the backgrounds are very far cry  think tropical vegetation poorish roads but critically are quite large and varied  so you can expect wellmade tarmacked roads to ring islands with grotty little dirt tracks in the centre often leading to ledges mountains etc  the vehicles are mostly regular cars i believe generic models including pickups and a rig  dont expect forumula 1 cars this is a far more everyday selection of vehicles

so far it all sounds uninspiring  what makes it so good  well the physics engine effectively makes it a crash simulator  every piece of each car is detailed to give it form bendableness weight and mass etc  when assembled they work as a real car would but when you come into contact with something they all crush get displaced and generally smash up most convincingly  on its own its not enough to make a car game but when its combined with a very satisfying feeling of driving you have a potential monster hit

in a word what we have here is the beauty of mathematics cutting edge in all its glory put to use to smash things up  its fantastic rewarding enormous fun to drive and best of all utterly convincing  ive crashed enough in this game to know that you dont want to fishtail and clip the rear of your car if youre going to crash in real life because the loss of control is horrendous as in how a certain english exprincess met her fate  you stand a far better chance of survival just going head on with an object despite the gforces with a seatbelt of course  

trust me the first time you crash a car in this game the sense of emotional trauma in the silence that follows is palpable

so there it is  a few cars some nice locations and nothing to do  all dressed up and nowhere to go  im not even sure that anyone knows exactly how it will all end up when it finally becomes a game  there are experiments with car chases and theres always the prospect of multiplayer but frankly it doesnt lend itself to the usual genres of car games  you just have to buy it on faith at the moment but its still immensely enjoyable

crazikyle points out that there are lots of mods available right now and for many people this is a deal breaker  im no expert on mods so by all means anyone who has some to recommend should add them to the bottom of the review in the comments section  i want to make this review as helpful as possible and if you folks can help do that by contributing suggestions then please go right ahead and do so

one more thought to leave you with ive played some excellent racing games including iracer project cars assetto corsa etc  none of them feel like you are driving an organic realworld machine quite the way that beamng does  the cars in beamng are made of assembled pieces and the pieces shake and rattle and bounce under the torque and forces just like a real car  other developers  pretend their cars are real by suggesting movement and bounce but only beamng has the sense that you have a real honesttogod vehicle glued to your throttle pedal

if that isnt enough to pique your interest may i suggest a nice game of scrabble

the game is 24 dollars  those complaining the game has been out for 6 years if not longer need to understand this game is being made by about 20 people  and for 24 bucks its got alot you can do   and with nearly 1000 hours into this game on steam and probably more then that before it was on steam i can say without a shadow of a doubt this game is worth its weight in gold and then some

mods add an insane value to the game  i have been around for alot of the crazy stuff  from the first working shooting tanks  to cloth physics being a thing  a drone with a mini gun attached to it i miss this mod alot wish it would be updated  airplanes being in the game as mods and flying purely from physics alone with no programming otherwise added to the engine for them to function and helicopters   all of the wild and wacky crashing maps rock crawling maps racing showroom  or even just exploring   

beam mp
you cant talk about beamng without talking about this mod  it lets you play on servers with other people adding functionality previously thought impossible to the game  you can literally do anything you can do alone with all of them  from cop chases  from the start my friends and i thought that multiplayer would be a god send to this game and it is  at this point they go hand in hand and cant really be separated  yes its buggy  and funny  nothing like seeing your buddy rock crawling with half his truck bent under itself and driving along like nothing is wrong

the game can be rough to run at times looking at you jungle rock island and other times barly sips on the system  it all really depends on what your trying to do  i have played this on low end laptops to extreamly high end desktops and even at the low frame rate end the crashes are fun and enjoyable to watch and the game even has a reduced collision mode to make low end gaming more accessible  on the higher end of things you can turn on realtime reflections and have many more cars on screen so you can turn on traffic  as the game gets more and more updates its preformance goes up massively  there was a time that the tseries would barly run on even the top end cpus  i remember when they added the outer ring to the grid map and my fx8350 at the time would tank down under 30 fps if i drove on it because of the bumps on the surface  but that was years ago  the game runs near flawlessly now

i cant gush enough about this game  its been a big part of my life and has kept me sane for some of it yea its that important of a game to me i know im a nerd

all that said things i would love to see is a pairing of this game with snowrunnerspintires  or maybe farming sim  all 3 would be interesting

system specs at time of writing
cpuamd ryzen 7 3800x
ram32gb gskills trident z rgb  3200 mhz
gpuevga rtx 3080 xc3 ultra
motherboardgigabyte b550 aorus master

and yes i know my review was less of a review and more of a beloved fans rambelings on possibly there most cherished game

gud game

#####

game is absolutly amazing

#####

buy beamngdrive 
expect a decent car accident simulator
discover scenarios
attempt to drive at high speed through some desert in utah 
gain respect for rally drivers 
attempt to drive a fast lap around a race track in japan
gain respect for professional race car drivers
attempt to drive in manual transmission mode and actually do something successfully at the same time
gain respect for everyone who drives a manual
attempt to drive a large cement mixer through whats essentially a jungle road in a third world country
gain all of the respect for people who do that for a living 
break your radiator repeatedly 
lose respect for whoever the hell makes those 
you should buy beamngdrive

#####

if physics give you a stiffy get this game in a jiffy

#####

#####

if youre into cars as much as me this game is definitely for you

thanks to the massive modding community you rarely get bored of this great game
i can sit for hours and change things on my car just to make it faster or so i get the grip i need to take a corner at 200kmh i think one of the funniest things you can do in this game is just to build stupid fast sleeper cars i know ive only played 322 hours of this game but ive been around this game forever my friend got it just when it was released and i have watched him play it a lot its so impressive to see what the developers have done in a very short amount of time just a few years ago this game did not have as much stuff and features so great appreciation for the team of beamngdrive 

keep the updates coming devs we love what youre doing

sincerely yours a car addict


#####

bthe good stuffb
this game is much more than a crash simulator this is without a doubt the best vehicle simulator of all time each individual component of the vehicle is simulated at 2000 times per second in real time creating a driving experience like no other this is unlike vehicles in any other game as they are essentially boxes on wheels whereas beamng simulates almost every single component of the car this game also recieves many updates with a new vehicle a small classic italian car a map based on italy and a new and optimised ui expected to arrive in the coming months edit car and map have been released

also the beamng community is great with many high quality mods made for the game and a friendly environment in the game forums on the beamng website the developers are also always in contact with the community helping us resolve issues and answer questions as this game is early access we are essentially helping improve the game for its official release 

recently beamngdrive has partnered up with the car creation game automation in my opinion this is the best game collaboration of all time as it allows you to make whatever you wish in automation and port it over to beamng and drive it around this allows the previously almost impossible task of modding available to almost anyone you can also upload your creations to the beamng repository for anyone to enjoy 

bthe notsogood stuffb
the only major issue with the complexity of the game is it requires a reletively decent computer to run it properly make sure your pc at least meets the minimum requirements before purchasing the game although you want to at least meet the recomended requirements to have a more enjoyable experience you will need a decent cpu gpu and at least 8gb of ram to run this properly despite this the game is constantly being optimised to run on lower end computers 

there is also no multiplayer the developers are well aware of the demand however they are focussing on getting the game prepared for official release and finishing the career mode dont expect multiplayer in the near future 

bthe neutralb
want to make a mod good luck mod creation for beamng due to its complexity is no easy task you will find many of the high quality mods you will use are actually created by adults who have a background with computers there is a steep learning curve although all the necessary information to make a mod is on the beamng wiki on the website and the community will help you resolve issues you may face creating a mod despite this as i outlined above you can easily make youre own vehicle in automation and port it to beamng currently automation cars to not deform as well as real mods and they dont have interiors as of when this review was published but it is a much easier and quicker way to make your dream car in beamng 

bother thingsb
i have read the negative reviews of the game and most of the issues they adress are not actually an issue with the game many complaints are a result of their computer not meeting the minimum requirements a brokenoutdated mod andor having no idea how to work a computer just ignore the negative reviews and if you have an issue visit the forums and the communitydevs will help you find a solution to your problem 

bsummaryb
in summary the positives definately outweigh the negatives beamng will provide you with a driving experience like no other espicially if you use a racing wheel beamng supports almost all racing wheels you will have countless hours of fun  from smashing up your car until it is almost unrecognisable to driving a bus around maps and making all the stops sure there is no multiplayer but  if your computer can handle it its well worth the price you wont regret buying this game

#####

haha car goes vroom hits a wall and kaboom

#####

135 hrs in and im addicted i got this to do offroading and rock crawling it is and can be very realistic you will have to do some setting up to allow the vehicle to do what you want but it will this is completely open you get all cars maps settings many many mods to access you can free play as you want how you want or play the time trials and scenarios you do not have to win to move forward and get the vehicle you want it is yours day one the game is evolving and getting better over the years the vehicle physics move react and crash like real vehicles the crawling is a blast build up your vehicle and slow crawl like a real crawler take a lazy drive through the country race a million dollar car roll play with your friends with the multiplayer mod its up to you this is how gaming should be play your way

#####

yes i would recommend this game because this game allows people who love cars but cant drive to fully experience the joy of driving with an almost perfect representation of what driving would be like

#####

the physics of beamngdrive is so good that it actually helped me got my manual van license

and i learned how to drift with a van

would love to see multiplayer and steam workshop

update weve got nitro now and a huge awesome urban map eurobeat intensifies

#####

my friend gave me this game
excited i drove home super fast
i accidentally crashed into a car totaling it
walked home
installed beamngdrive

1010 will play and recommend again

#####

i am a 55 year old biker and trucker father and probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is 14 now my son got this game for from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game and started playing but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he let me borrow his logitech wheel me and my son then played in turns and i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories thank you beamng

#####

only racing game thats ever held my attention this long highly recommend

#####

95100

absolutely fantastic highly recommend this game if you love anything to do with cars realistic games physics simulation the game is still in a relatively early state and there is masses of things to be added such as fully working ai

 pros 
 in game terrain  level editor
 highly detailed cars
 in depth customisation
 extremely realistic physics
 relatively easy to play  use
 large maps to explore
  lots of different areas for testing vehicles
 modding support
 many new vehicles being introduced mods
 many new levels being introduced mods
 relatively frequent updates
 lots of support and help via the forums
 graphics are very good and to be improved over time

 cons 
 requires a beefy computer to run on full graphics with more than one car
 can be a little bit unstable at times
  a bit glitchy at times
 awkward name really scraping the barrel looking for cons now 
 no multiplayer yet

this is just a quick review of the game summing up all i can think of off the top of my head i really do recommend this game to everyone interested in cars simulators andor exploring and even those who arent and just want to ps about with physics and smash some things 

simply amazing and truely ground breaking realism much more to come

#####

the gold standard for realistic damage very well maintained and growing steadily for years at a reasonable price and no bs monetisation

#####

i have played this game for seven years and god damn its amazing

#####

my insurance bill is 20000 a month due to my attempts to drift in this video game but thankfully i can activate 500kw of nitrous oxide and simply blow up my engine so they cant take my car

#####

great game for people who love cars and realistic physics

#####

poured hundreds of hours into this game outside steam

its the best driving simulator on the market there is absolutely no competition in terms of how accurately everything is simulated in beamngdrive and with the smallest things suchas oil temperature block temperature tire brake coolant temperature the amazing softbody physics actual mechanical failures an evergrowing roster of official cars and levels the best dev team ive ever seen behind any product ever and a constantly expanding modding scene this game is worth more than its price and the developers are more than deserving of every penny everything is physically simulated in realtime no scripted movement or anything of that nature the weakest part of the game are the visuals but even those suffice

10010 absolutely recommend to every car enthusiast

#####

this is the best driving game out there one day it will be the best driving sim game also

#####

i love the cars i watched beamng as i was young at 5 6 or7 im now 11 playing and learning this game i love the etks sooo beautiful

#####

funny car crash compilation part 6389

#####

this game was so influential in my life that when i saw a family sedan with 2 children and their parents in it get hit by a semi truck and get turnt into a pile of metal and some weird raspberry jam i immediately knew it was a beamng reference

1010  would witness a violent death again

#####

at 827 hours of play i can 1000000000000 recommend this game if you are a modaholic like me this has to be the one of the most moddable game which is impressive considering bethesda exists also car go crunch and gives serotonin this was also the first game i bought when i started pc gaming recommended


after over 1000 hours i still agree car go crunch dopamine gets triggered happiness is car crashes

#####

you can keep busy for hours appreciating subtle differences in color shade or gear modes when scrolling through hundreds of the same cars select one randomly and start playing when you encounter your first game crash you find out that no progress has been saved the option to save progress of missions doesnt exist its no problem as there are tons of cool challenges in free mode like finish the race with low damage the game wont tell you what low damage means instead you play a race 20 times until the ai doesnt crash into you at the start after carefully finishing without touching anything you find out that it was not enough in its own way that is the real achievement

the races against the ai will also grow on you because theres no minimap or any way to know where the turns go you start to appreciate the need to learn the track inside out or prepare your own pacenotes so you have a chance to take the turns correctly the absence of guidance becomes exhilarating 

you start to love the convoluted selection of different menus because you can feel like an admin using a developer console figuring out how to reset your car after youve ditched it becomes a satisfying puzzle you will find all these features you dont need like setting your car on fire or spawning a frozen copy of it freezing other ai cars or entering the freecam mode that can not be exited without knowing the specific hotkey to do so or enabling and changing the color of the driver gforces display on the screen during for a specific type of race

eventually you realize respawning your car on the closest road isnt an option but it doesnt matter as you already forgot that you were even looking for that the time to refund the game has passed long ago by then but you dont care anymore it is too late for these thoughts and you can now start rationalizing your purchase

youve spent hours understanding the ui filling notepads with hotkeys you need and now you are able to drive on a straight road in free roam and enjoy the meditative experience you realize the game was never limiting you its only your mind that sets the limits all that is left to do is recording your very own free bird meme video for youtube and make even more people pass their refund timeframe and join this wonderful community

the games been in early access for 8 years there is no reason to be bothered by its flaws in fact i have come to love them i know exactly what folder to delete to reset my settings after i accidentally removed the speedometer from my ui again each quirk and missing feature becomes a testament to the games unique charm a challenge to overcome a story to tell 

you find yourself defending the game passionately convinced that its idiosyncrasies are what make it truly great talking about the most realistic physics of a car crash becomes your chant the game isnt just a game anymore its a journey a lifestyle a testament to perseverance and the joy of discovery ive not only accepted the games madness ive embraced it and in doing so i have found the truest form of sanity

#####

i dont have my drivers license yet but after playing this im warning you  you should really stay off the road im coming 

edit im here watch out

#####

its alright i wish cars could get dirty and scratched

i purchased this game since day 1 and i am very very glad i did i have seen the development of the game grow from the start the developers have been amazing keeping us informed of the status of the game with consistant detailed dev blogs

an amazing game with the best physics engine for vehicles out there 
from crashes weight of the vehicle traction torque  everything is incredibly accurate

there is so much to do with many many hours of fun from using community made mods such as vehicles maps objects and much more cruising around the beautiful maps reenacting crash scenes racing demoilition derby  the list goes on

it may seem as if i have only been on this game for a couple of hours but i can assure you i have played this game well over 100 hours

#####

i smashed a bus going 130 mph into an among us character v fun

#####

car

#####

best game ever just needs multiplayer

#####

do you like flight simulators sandbox concept but want to drive in a vehicle  do you like tweeking and modding your car and testing them to perfection  this game is exactly right for you  beamngdrive happens to be a car physics sandbox game

#####

after 500 and a half hours of pure enjoyment i believe its safe to say this is one of the most robust softbody physics simulation out there to date i highly almost offensivly recommend this game to anyone looking for a indepth vehicle simulation the devs push out an update once a month i should mention some are delayed but its worth the awesome content which is quite rare nowadays i also should mention there is a great fan base with amazing forums also cant forget the spectacular community mods that are out there cheers

edit im here to update my review as i now have clocked 700 hours yes that is correct i managed to find something to do on this game for 700 hours exact my original review still stands one of the few games that fits all my desires involving automobiles amazing simulation an softbody physics i highly recommend this

edit here we are 2020 1500 hours the game is still freaking fantastic it feels like a fine wine that has been perfected over a viking year let these cars bring you to the lands of valhalla ride on brothers highly recommended still

edit well 2023 times were tough but i still managed almost another 500 hours i couldnt recommend this game more than ive tried in the past as a self proclaimed backyard mechanic this game scratches certain niches for all humanoids just need to tap into your imagination i wish everyone well and may the new year be a bit brighter than the last

beamngdrive the physics of destruction

ive always been fascinated by physics so when i first heard about beamngdrive i was immediately intrigued the idea of a game that simulated the physics of destruction in such detail was simply too good to pass up

i was not disappointed beamngdrive is a truly unique experience that allows you to experiment with physics in ways that are simply not possible in real life you can crash cars flip trucks and even build your own vehicles to see how they react to different forces

one of the things i love most about beamngdrive is the sense of realism the physics engine is incredibly detailed and it really feels like youre driving a real car the cars react to damage in a realistic way and its always exciting to see how theyll perform in a crash

another thing i love about beamngdrive is the creativity the game is full of tools that allow you to customize your vehicles and create your own scenarios you can build your own race track create a demolition derby or even make a movie

of course no game is perfect beamngdrive can be a bit demanding on your computer and the graphics can be a bit dated but overall beamngdrive is an amazing game that i highly recommend to anyone who loves physics or destruction

nobody reads this anyways so im just going to say im bitchless

#####

haha car go brrrr

#####

this car sim deserving big letters car sim reminds me of a musician fellow of mine he plays in a clown cover band that is a sort of parody of many other famous bands a project that is amusing but you cant take it seriously as a real band then the actual guy is miles high the most talented guitarist ive ever met personally world class with great ideas but he never took himself seriously enought to become a song writer or start his own band

so beamngdrive has a magnificent physical engine under the hood that becomes a facemelting experience every time i drive it it has the best and most detailed ffb ive ever seen the car tells me every time of exactly what it is happening between the wheels and the actual surface with the softbody physics that is sort of wonderfully ruthless realistic and true beamngdrive would make the most perfect racing sim in the history in my opinion you miss the breaking point the tree shreds your car to pieces race over you cook your engine race over  hit the sidewalk wheel is fractured and suspension is bent race over no bs no sugar exactly like in real life 

but beamngdrive doesnt take itself seriously at least not as a racing sim it became the prime car crashing game it has the talent of beating the siht out of _______ insert your classy sim title here in its own field but it just doesnt seem to bother of course it provides its own distinctive sandbox driving experience thats fun and in a way is beyond a plain racing sim just by the variety of vehicles that you can drive here even fully exploring a single official map would take many days i guess and it does have racing activities but it lacks racing sim features like championship mode race series mode leagues and so on maybe it would make no sense as 98 of people would probably crash each other before the first corner i dont know but beamngdrive would fit time attack type racing like rally or hillclimb so perfectly

httpsyoutubetxy2pcuyrssiqdwu2moip_ifetdo

so for me this car sim is the most honest and talented of all of them that became a crashing sim eventually after all of these years it still says early access so who knows maybe it will include a more detailed racing module until that i just try to beat my times on the twisty road courses to me it feels extremely satisfying to survive a good run in more or less one piece on a section where even rough road patches can kill you or fistsized stones can launch the car into the air like in real life by realism and difficulty it gives the famously difficult and realistic and great let me add richard burns rally a run for its money in my opinion actually beamngdrive became one of my most favourite rally experiences ever drive to survive literally

this game is amazing i effin love it period

#####

ive played this game since like 2014 amazing game mindblowing physics amazing community couldnt recommend it more

#####

this game fills a niche that shouldve been filled years ago oh wait it did fill it years ago and its still being updated as of this review

#####

good but add multiplayer pls

#####

good game well built

#####

vrrrrrooooom brbrbrrrrrr rrrrrrrrrraaa vroomrvrvrororroooo rrrrrrrr

#####

i have to say this is one of the greatest games ever made having over 1000 hours i can easily say that this game never gets boring or old and the developers keep adding more content to keep it interesting i would highly recommend a controller or steering wheel for this game as the keyboard is incredibly difficult and annoying  to play with i will easily put on another 1000 hours on this game the modding community is amazing so even if you get bored from the stock game you can always go to the steam workshop and download more content there is so much to do in this game from editing vehicles to doing head on crashes on the highway there is always something to do overall 1010

#####

this is one amazing game and it is pushing the edges of softbody physics ive been playing this game since almost right after it came out this isnt any arcade car crashing simulator this is a physics engine used as a car game think about this type of technology used to make fully destructible worlds in game games think about playing gta 8 and crashing your car into a building to see it fall over anyways i am getting a bit carried away here are some pros and cons of this game

pros
amazing physics
plenty of mods
very detailed maps
nice graphics
forums
oh wait this game is still in alpha

cons
sort of unpolished
less freetime cause this game is just too awesome

i recommend this game to anyone looking for a realistic car crashing simulator
if youre looking for an arcade car crashing game i would recommend next car game

have fun crashing

beamngdrive is a car simulator with the most realistic softbody physics in any game to date there is already a lot of content created by an active modding community with addons ranging from sports cars all the way to airplanes even though this game is still in its early stages i am very excited to see what is added on to the game in the future

pros 
active community
realistic physics
make your own courses 

cons
still in early stages so lots of bugs

yeah i like crashing cars

#####

i crash car

#####

very detailed motion simulation of the vehicle recommending for sure

#####

if you like to crash cars or just general fooling about then  this game is for you

#####

now im more worried about coolant temperature in real life

#####

crash many times with my car 

#####

cool but requires a beefy pc otherwise its lovely better graphics than most aaa titles
valid game 



#####

cars go wroom pc does b boom b

#####

i love that this can be all racing games in one with real damage

#####

yes

#####

this game is the best way to try your hand at any sort of driving you cannot do in real life
its best enjoyed with a proper steering wheel and pedal setup but can be enjoyed with a controller just fine

ive not yet come across any other game with a driving model that even comes close to beamngdrive let alone the soft body physics

the game is still rough around the edges but if youre just looking for a great driving experience and some spectacular soft body physics when things go wrong or very right depending then this game is for you

#####

this game is one of the best value for money games you can buy for just 1899 you could be in possesion of by far the most realistic and detailed drivingcrashing simulator there is seriously its that good i genuinely cant think of anything wrong with it other than the lack of multiplayer i have been a massive petrol head since i was born and honestly with a good wheel setup this is the closest you can get to actually sitting in the driving seat no other game comes close nothing is animated or scripted everything is ultrarealisticly simulated from the flexing of the car body to the bolts and hinges holding on the body panels to the superb feeling through the wheel of the suspension steering and drive linkages if you are at all a car enthusiast or just like driving you must experience this game

#####

lovely tool to mess around with target audience perhaps those who like tools like garrys mod but want a game with easy menu ui that can be operated with a game pad and a general theme that revolves around cars 

intrigued by my summer car but dont want any of that grind with engines and instead drive yes this is for you interested in different setups for a car model or interested in particular real life car models on how they look like  break apart as a soft physics model in the sim this is for you 

lots of mods in form of tracks car models and different setups and kits for said cars mod scene is weird i see lots of passionate talk about level of quality on mods and how realistic some models look or dont look  if none of this interests you then consider again quality of course varies but there is lot of the stuff 

this game replaces nothing on the existing racing game scene it instead occupies its own niche slot and because of that i recommend getting it pretty openly to many but it requires at least rudimentary interest in messing around with cars and spending time checking out scenarios and mods and just spending time with the product to unlock its potential devs have included some campaigns for achievements and scenarios and there is good support for wheels driving is nice with game pad too but its obvious the first requirement from the player is interest into the various topics presented in the game and spending time to find the fun parts nothing is served on a force fed silver plate you choose what you want to do

all in all a good product get it if you find yourself intrigued and have enough time and interest to explore  do not be scared of the early access tag this product is very far into development at this stage 12024 and i have had no issues whatsoever

#####

tldr get it do it

this is the game ive dreamed about as a destructive child a simple child melting my match box cars with gasoline i grew up playing with crash test dummies ive played every system since atari i have waited decades for a game like this bunout series destruction derby series vigilante 8 series route 66 and next car game nothing compares to this yes i know those games are different genres but nontheless you know what maybe i am overzealous or maybe just maybe this is what ive been waiting on for my whole gaming life all i can say is if this game wasnt touched again by developers if this was the final product id pay 100 for it i may trade my xbox one for it rare replay included  i was uneasy purchasing the early access but beamngdrive called out to me i could not wait and the positive reviews after the update were the final straw i am 31 years old thirty one people i may be too old to get one off when vr porn comes into full futrition but at least i can say i have experienced my gaming destiny beamngdrive developers i love you

#####

good game

#####

 

 is good




buy it


 




#####

its cool i play it a little

#####

i have never seen anything like these softbody physics and compatible with logitech racing wheel

#####

cars go boom boom

#####

good practice for being a drunk driver the crashes are very nice

#####

its a fun game but could use workshop support as an easier way to download content but other than that its a blast

update theyve added workshop support in game not steam workshop and it works really nicely so i really cant not recommend this game at this point definitely a very fun and amazing game

#####

beamng drive is the best free roam driving game i have ever played this game has so many different cars and trucks you can choose from and there are many different mods there are also many different maps to choose from but the best part is the crash physics the physics are 1000 stars for me also the ai is very sophisticated

#####

fun


#####

i like going fast and eating ass

#####

avarage beamng player


























#####

a game made by people that love cars for people that love cars that makes you love cars even more

#####

great game needs online multiplayer

#####

physics porn

#####

beamng is a brilliant driving simulator featuring realistic physics and some of the best deformation and damage simulations ive ever seen there are two features in particular that stand out to me one included in the box and the other a community mod

feature one is the ability to mod every car in the game adding and removing parts to create wildy different configurations want to make a light and fast sedan for the track how about mixing it up and throwing on some bigger tyres and a heftier engine for offroad go for it

feature two is the brilliant multiplayer mod beammp  spin up a server for your friends or join one of the dozens already on offer including official beammp servers words cannot describe how hilarious it gets with friends  and there are a heap of custom maps that support multiplayer gameplay such as flood and various downhill challenges

beamng is an easy 910 and recommended to all car fans racing fans and multiplayer lovers who love a good laugh or a decent challenge

#####

forza 5 i hope i dont fall off this cliff in the next corner
gta 5 ive just fully modded my car better not fall off this cliff

beamng lets drive off this cliff and see what happens

3740910 would crumple my 3 wheeler again

#####

if i drop a sedan from really high up when it hits the ground its actually crushed and in slomo it shows all the parts being bent back and twisted its like saw for vehicles

whereas if you drop a sedan in gta v from over a mile up in the sky it just bounces off the ground with a dent in the front

#####

are you kidding me they have vr support now

#####

1187 hours over the years still going

#####

great game if only it had multiplayer

#####

i thought now currently at the amount of hours i have in this game would be a good time for my review of beamngdrive it is a very good game it has a lot of potential and i am glad something like this game exists in the simulationdriving genre the vehicle physics are realistic and on point as well and its amazing how a game like this is able to be made and improved upon as well overtime there is basically endless options and opportunities to choose from from maps to cars and everything in between involving vehicles you surely wont be bored the modding community keeps coming out with and creating many mods for further enjoyment which is a plus as well there are cars and also planes that i personally didnt think would be possible to add into the game there is an ingame mod manager which is easy to download and look for mods and also through beamngs official website there are also other mod websites out there to get mods for this game but a lot of it is poorly created mods stolen and they dont even work well and there are risks of viruses if you dont know what your getting into all in all i would recommend this game and the community seems to really stand behind it even during its current ea stage

i crash car very yes

#####

its worth it if you have a good pc

#####

this and automation is the best collab ever

#####

this game is amazing it has left me entertained for hours upon hours on end i highly recommend this game for anyone who is into realistic driving and realistic crashes

#####

you get to crash stuff into other stuff with realistic physics what more can you ask for oh you want mods the game has those you want backstory to your crashes try scenarios you want to take over the world the game cant really help with that but it can help you vent your frustration when your world domination plans fail you want a game that will drop your gpa because you play it instead of doing homework then i assure you this game will hamper your education for years to come like it has hampered mine for years i r8 88 m8

#####

ive spent 25 hours ramming various cars into walls at high speeds just to watch the crash im very happy to say it was time well spent

#####

online would be great

#####

wow im truly amazed at how detailed and realistic this game is ever since i joined beamng its been mind blowingly improved and constantly recieving info from the devs and you can do whatever you want racing or stacking semis onto each other

pros 
extremely detailed simulation
very open world nothing you cant do
customization
a huge modding cummunity
racing
being able to do what ever you want

cons
early access means bugs but theyre always quickly fixed
no multiplayer yet

#####

is this the best game i own why yes yes it is and why is that 

this game contrary to most other games is absolutely genius its extremely stable never crashes and there are very few bugs and yet you can crash multiple cars into eachother at once without dropping in frames how is that possible you ask i have no clue it has something to do with the games node and beam system that is very cleverly designed you can read the documentation on their website 

alright that wasnt very informative why should you buy the game then

beamng is really well made there are constant contentupdates the most recent ones being realistic sounds and aitraffic now the ai is pretty goddamn stupid thats a fact but you dont need the ai all they do is get in the way and attempt uturns on the highway screw those pesky ai youre too good for them the devs are working on it though dont worry
you can do whatever you want in beamng being completely physicsbased unlike most other games wanna fly oh you can fly wanna throw stuff around to your hearts content my friend wanna murder innocent bystanders you might need some imagination for that but im sure you can do that too all in all this game is realistic in the way that being able to drive a car in beamng might translate into experiences you could have in the real world you can practice your driving in this game 

so what are you waiting for get it play it mod it  do whatever you want i guarantee youll enjoy it

#####

the best driving simulator period
unmatched softbody physics customization sounds graphics  everything in beamng is close to perfection  and the game is still in early access the only feature it lacks is visual customization liveries stickers bodykits etc but these arent available in many autosims looking at you assetto corsa lots of quality mods which include cars maps and a freaking jato rocket ensure youll have hundreds of hours of fun here touge track drift rally time attack offroad rock crawling drag  and with zero level loading screens just a few seconds to switch your car zero dlcs intuitive interface and builtin gamepad support are also here 1010 worth your time and money

update v024 where negative reviews come from
after the major ui overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted many of those call the game literally unplayable  which is obviously greatly exaggerated unlike the other stated problem lost controller presets that one is actually unpleasant to deal with judging from the reviewers words since i myself didnt experience a single problem with my dualshock4 nor with the game itself but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided as every major update comes after a teaser  which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down just in case the update affects it

to sum up beamngdrive is still a nearly perfectrated game  and a lot of the negative reviews are to put it mildly unjustified

update i love the new covet

#####

satisfying crashes  amazing detail in physics and more  great game but you need a decent potato to run

#####

car

#####

this a great game to let you just casually drive without being forced to race or compete its very relaxing when your brain is too frazzled after work the mod support is good lots of new free interesting cars to configure and experiment with

best time waster of 2017

#####

hella fun to wreck vehicles so many mods endless fun love the endless updates that add so much to an already great game cant believe they reworked tires then added dual stage suspensions and now theyre reworking manual transmissions to allow for accurate throttle shift timing

#####

edit now have 2500hours and still love it 
this game is my favourite game that ive ever played no doubt ive had this game since it was only available on the website for 5 dollars and to be honest this game gets better and better with each update it dont think ive ever found something in this game that caused me to not want to play it this game is limitless every crash is different every bump you go over affects the car in a different way this game is extremely realistic and is by far the best game ive ever played the devs work themselves to the bones to get these updates out and damn are they worth the wait whether its a new map vehicle or both its always amazing over the course of about 5 years of owning this game ive built up about 1600 hours in this game so i think this can say something about this game and whether you wanna go for a calm drive through the country or chuck a semi off a cliff this game can do it this is well worth 25 dollars i would pay 50 for it get it while its on sale trust me you wont regret it tho make sure you check minimum requirements this game is very demanding

#####

great game i love chasing the ai in police cars its also very realistic

#####

beamng drive what a wonderful game 

why should you choose this game over others

because its fun as hell thats why you dont have a goal or objective you can create whatever you want to your hearts content  and express homicidal tendicies  all in one game without doing it in real life

ive found this game to be a good stress reliever for me actually and also comes with the ability to mod it which is also great

1210 would buy all over again

#####

this game is like everyone else has said very demanding on your pc so if you dont at least meet the recommended specs then unfortunately id say just stick to watching crashboompunks videos on youtube and youll get all the satisfying destruction you could want my pc meets the recommended specs and even i have to run the game no higher than medium with some settings on low if i want a consistent frame rate if your pc can run this game and you want a vehicle sim get this game now car tweaking that would please any gear head practically any driving sport you could want can be recreated here drifting hillclimbs rally hajwalah you name it

#####

got mad when my car in real life didnt crash this realistically 

1010

#####

this is the best car game i ever see 
beamng team do more than ea with all their nfs series 

huge updates every week new cars every week new scenarios new maps 

like wtf is this real in 2016 

modding tunning crashes scenarios tricks and this cost less then 20 bucks 

best developers thank you for this game

#####

just make sure you have a good computer

#####

love the game been playing sense 2017

#####

its a perfect game however i would like one thing to have multiplayer my friend and i have been wanting to play beamngdrive together for soo long other that that this is the perfect game for people who want a vehicle simulation keep it up

#####

i will leave the cat here so that everybody who passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards

why am i playing beamngdrive

a question that actually a lot people have asked me with the time after around 200 hours of playing it i think i know now why the realistic crash simulation detailed vehicles detailed cities lets you dive into a world of realism you can simulate different situations like crashes accidents or stunts with the ability of actually moving around everywhere in the maps there are no limits to your creativity and your desire to discover and drive i really like driving cars no matter if in real life or ingame in beamngdrive you can drive everything that you want no money can set you borders
now besides the cars and their phsyic the maps large explorable maps with detailed landscapes and buildings roads it just feels amazing driving through a dead city down a highway or just through the jungle the atmosphere of the maps are just perfectly to let you feel you are realy driving
the community is expanding the variaty of maps cars and their configurations skins and a lot more every day there is new stuff coming out and i have to say that i am always there to keep an eye on good and new stuff 
the partnership with automation was wonderful as well realistic car models real life design of your own favourite vehicle and then driving it in beamng is maybe the best thing that could happen to that game 

all in all i have to say that this game is just incredible fun its hard to describe the effect the game has on me i can hardly recommend it


one more thing to the developer team of the game beamng
keep up the god damn nice work free updates and patches developing and evolutioning the environment engine sounds car designs and configurations bug fixes and a lot more the love that the team is putting into this whole game is just amazing and examplary for the one or other game i realy appreciate you being there listening to the community and making the game perfect as i said keep it up

please excuse my bad english 

#####

best realistic single player driving sim ever made  immensely fun and replayable

#####

the most realistic game i have ever played in my life this is the best game ever

#####

great for tailgating

#####

please make this game online multiplayer


#####

this game is more than a crash simulator

beamng just might be the most realistic vehicle simulator ive ever played the customization is deep you can pretty much add a turbo to anything the physics are close to realistic including assigning a variable clutch and you can grind gears overheat coolant and break pretty much any part of an engine

the updates lately have made the game even better the sounds now sound absolutely amazing i really like the sound of the v6 its so realistic cars can now backfire and the new map which is west coast usa

i definitely recommend this game to any gearheads

#####

ow my balls hurt
