everything about this game is amazing if you like weirdnessprone simulators like dwarf fortress or rimworld  or if you just like xianxia in general this is for you just a few highlights of my first eight hours which i played through in one sitting without even realizing

my entire monastery burnt to the ground after i slew a demon who turned out to have flammable selfigniting blood in the middle of it

one of my monks had a bedroom that bedroom had such bad feng shui that it literally killed him

another monk meditated on feminine energies so deeply that his er monk junk fell off i fully intend to forge it into a powerful artifact 

my most powerful monk has become deeply aspected to the element of fire he has a private room to cultivate himself in thats so stocked with fireaspected items that its hotter than a furnace it doesnt bother him at all of course but theres this recurring problem of regularpeople caretakers that keep going in there to sweep the floors and they pretty much instantly burn down to ash

a giant hole opened in my monastery and theres a dragon living in it that will absolutely murder my entire school if i dont build him the most amazing bedroom imaginable

one of my most powerful monks is tiny old man that does nothing but play go all day and compose bad music unless bandits attack whereupon he immediately hops on his sword and flies over to instantly paste them all in the span of seconds then its back to go

dont buy this rimworld is pixie stix and i upgraded to crack now i have 300 rimworld mods installed and its not even a fifth as complex as this game

im hopelessly addicted 94 hours 6 days do the math ive slept 5 out of 7 days this week i barely played sunday because i couldnt reach my computer a combined total of 1 hour of that maybe was afk time

god save me because i cant save myself

if you play dwarf fortress youll wonder what im yammering about but im hoping old gods cant see what im writing from their decadent thrones

this game was a gift from a friend and i feel like he gave me a necronomicon

ive read literally 500 pages of guides ive been driven to the point of almost writing my own despite the discord existing there are hordes of people with questions that are still unanswered because nobody knows the answers this game is inscrutable how do i farm spirit soul gems i type my fingers shaking my eyes bloodshot i have found them a merchant is selling i buy twentyfive i cannot use them to make my qi more efficient it was a waste of time all along

i cannot use them i never needed them the peasants swarm the gates walking willingly into hell for an opportunity to join that isnt there my sect is at 24 out of 24 and no plans to promote soon the demons ice freezes another twentyfive souls in anguished death more anguish soul gems more talismans more upgrades on the items that upgrade my qi so i can upgrade my upgraded qi fifty times over and break through all reasonable limits i am ready to forge the perfect golden core a screenshot shows that my paltry 30k qi languishes next to the man with 1 million before golden core i cower i wail i gnash my teeth i plead for the mountains of earth to protect me from the harsh sun of the radiance of his might

solo sects with this build the guide says make a tigerman think with the power of his tempered phallus how what why what what am i going

im the moon form my sanctuary riddled with discarded genitals my shendaos are gods in golden realms tethered to the mightest artifacts of all as they ascend they leave them behind remnants of their glory to be used by their dear friends in their mortal lives

a severed dick and a pile of shit their friends weep tears of joy no weapon could ever compare in power 

body cults the discord says snakes make terrible body cults my eyes glaze past words with no meaning assembling a meaning from the nonsense snakes make terrible body cults of course they have no arms you cannot punch with your face

who worships this body cult do they worship my shendao also no the shendaos tearyeyed successor is a housecat whos been praying for 20 days straight floating upside down in her room perhaps she will be spared the agony heaven wishes to inflict upon her the tiger is thinking the tiger is thinking heed its thoughts else it forget and lose all it is a frog awakened i ate it it was better off food than being cursed with the problems of mankind

when you see this review in six months you will understand by my play count 94 hours 94 hours was nothing nothing at all i havent even picked up the razor blade with which i will gently scratch the surface of this game trying to find some hint of what in the hell im doing

i love this game the tears do not stop i am enveloped by the sun

now lets get the obvious out of the way im sure you have seen comments about this game being just a rimworld copy or rip off those are wrong this game is only similar to rw if you brush the surface of this game beyond that the actual combat and character building of this game is extreme deep and complex worth hundreds of hours of experimenting and exploring there is even a proper main story plot panning out surrounding the mysterious destruction of your previous faction 

rw is fundamentally a survival game where resource management is tricky and surviving is difficult this one as you might have guessed from the tittle is not a survival game its about this whole cultivation thing surviving the elements of nature is easy in this game build a good character and turn them into a demigod now that is a challenge this game has the loop of delving into seemly simple mechanics only to discover deep and complex systems and then feeling everything is straight forward and easy again once youve mastered it a sign of good and thoughtful game design in my opinion

apart from the obvious language and culture barrier which i dont really have a solution to the one main struggle you might encounter during playing is the pace of the game it is really slow i will give you an example at the time of writing this ive been playing a new save on hardcore difficulty level in about 40 hours i progressed around 400 days ingame so you can expect to play somewhere around 12 hours for an ingame year granted lower difficulties progresses much much faster but this game has various hints that suggest you can play one save for more than a thousand ingame years traditionally in xianxia genre the process of this cultivation thing is slow and takes thousands of years so depends on how you look at things you can either say the game is too slow or fits the title just right

also i have yet to encounter a decent wiki for this game yet so you gotta do it the hard way discover things by yourself by trial and error there are some helpful comments in the game from other players on certain items but they are mostly in chinese

if you are a fan of the exotic chinese highfantasy world of xianxia i know theres a few out there i highly recommend the game it attempts to depict the part that usually get emitted or simplified in novels and other games for others id recommend the game but also be careful this is not a game for everybody and certainly not for less patient ones language barrier is a tough one to cross i dont know how much of a thing xianxia is among nonchinese speaking people but i suspect there are communities of them so maybe reach out for some help from those people im sure they are nice if they exists somewhere you never know internet is a big place

#####

recent negative review bombing due to a chinese mobile game launch that has microtransactions nothing to do with this pc version
game is complex but fun once you gradually get the hang of things

#####

tldr this application is not a game its like playing inside the unity engine if that is fun for you go for it
you will also learn about chinese culture along the way


you will spend your first few hours inside the game but as the game progresses you will spend more and more time outside of it you will start to read guides then you will ask questions on discord because the guides are mostly wrong misleading and misunderstood then you will ask more questions on discord then you will start to look up data in the game files because its the only reliably way to get on information then you make a friend who knows somebody who reverse engineered the game you start to talk about the game in whats the formula for x  then you scratch your head because even with the data files available and decompiled code you still cant figure out how the game works as an advanced player you will be able to formulate sentences like this dont push your qi gathering over 2500 or else you will create a qi void

you will sit down and start to make elaborated plans for character development collect data compare and make informed decision on a medium level this will take you hundreds of hours

 fights are disappointing mostly and we still dont know how they work exactly dont worry another 400 hours and i will be able to make a guide so you can read about it

 bossfights are even more dissapointing
you cant follow the fight visually your choice is literally to watch a health bar window or get epilepsy
throughout the fight you will sweat blood and tears to not kill them too early
bosses have zero consistent damage 99 of the time they do nothing but look away for a second and they will insta kill most things outside of a formation
they randomely destroy your sect which actually has nothing to do with the fight they just do it for shits and giggles they will die anyway but at least they hassled you as much as possible

 this application has no goals it is the most sandbox application you will ever play its not a sandbox game like terraria factorio or satisfactory there are literally no goals in there at least in the other games you get actual goals you want to achieve or something that you want to get access to not in this application the first hours you spend on this application wont be less meaningful than the last hours you spend on this game it all depends on how you set your own goals if you want to spend a 5 hours marathon on this and feel like you achieved nothing you can do it here

 to enjoy this application you will need mods and lots of them just like unity needs plugins to do special work you will need mods for this the most popular mod is the one that lets you cheat in anything and everything into the game and change anything into anything then you want to get more tiles grid info because thats actually information which might help you elysium for easier management and and and  

 this application is the kind of application which ships with 3 very good songs and then plays them over and over again thats not a joke you might want to get a mod for taht too

 translation its not bad and mostly done but  the game uses the same words for different things and different words for the same thing and so ultimately you will have to turn to datat sheets and decompiled code again to get an understanding of how things work

so what do you actually get out of it 
 you will be able to write your masters thesis on feng shui after a hundred hours because you literally cant take 2 steps without knowing about it if anybody needs to learn about feng shui in an anjoyable manner this is the experience
 animal people
 501 chinese medical ingredients
 chinese mythology
 you will learn to decompile a game because you cant get to know it otherwise
 1001 game mechanics most of your time you will spend on figuring out how the game works in fact thats how you count how far you are in the game in the amount of mechanics you know about
 3 very good songs

so  i just wish this application had goals you feel satisfaction over achieving them fights to look forward to and a story to unravel oh yes there is a story but in reality there is none

if this application keeps you interested for 600 hours i guess it deserves a thumbs up

living the cultivation dream i am my own 3589 chapter long wuxia novel

#####

while other reviews have talked about what they dislike or liked i figured id just mention what the gameplay is about so people know what they are getting into and why this game is so addicting 

heck even the negative reviews have like 600 hours played should tell you something 

in this game you are given characters that will power up and get stronger over time you can think of it like dragon ball z where they have power levels the goal of the game is for you to build a base and over time slowly raise very weak mortal humans into powerful demigods capable of splitting mountains and chopping the seas in half 

without getting too much into chinese lore this is where you get the cultivation part of the game title from instead of cultivating  growing plants or trees you are cultivating people and making them into truly powerful godlike entities in the world each with their own unique set of skills spells  weapons and equipment 

in the start of the game you will have very little knowledge on how to do this like how plants need water sunlight and good soil there are a myriad of factors that will create the perfect human and most people will miss all the subtle hints clues and trial and error to get just them all right in their first couple of playthroughs

to illustrate how indepth the system is  many playerwritten guides for a single aspect of the game can be over 100 pages 

there is pretty much more depth in this single game than practically 99 of all game out there in the market it will take weeks or months for the average person to get good enough to where they feel comfortable with all the mechanics 

and this is where a lot of the complaints tend to be focused on some people may find it a total waste of time or that some mechanics are frustrating but if you are having fun its pretty much like any game out there 

no you do not need to code or install a million mods or read all the guides you can enjoy the game just fine without them 

the big problem is that this game can be so addicting as you are slowly and patiently raising your people that it can drive ppl crazy and what you are hearing are the ppl who got so addicted they went off the deep end and jumped off a cliff of insanity 

but like all good communities there are several mods that pretty much bypasses anything people may find annoying or just add more flavor stuff for fun just like rimworld at the end of the day how much you enjoy the game will just be up to whether or not you like really openended sandboxes and complicated mechanics

being able to become god tame monsters and learn chinese mythology and lore are just a plus  

sincerely
someone who has played this game for too long

hey hey people

#####

watch sseths review on yt and then read through 200 pages of someones cheatsheet that they uploaded on their google drive then and only then you might have a chance of understanding what you are supposed to be doing

#####

amazing cultivation simulator is completely incomprehensible and poorly documented and half of what documentation exists is only available to those who know chinese or have installed mods to reveal hidden data even various wikis that normally document games like this in obsessive detail only have partial and occasionally wrong information on how everything works

its a bit like if rimworld was a halftranslated poorlydubbed wuxia movie

despite this it looks surprisingly gorgeous and has a very good soundtrack and you will lose hours of your life trying to figure this game out and making number go up its very addictive but at some point youll run into a barrier of not really knowing what to do next or having exhausted all the obvious avenues for growth and unlike a lot of these procedurally generated town builders there isnt a lot of freedom to fuck around with aesthetically pleasing builds and such 

i think there might be an actual endgame but i never found out how to make any progress on said endgame

either way get this if youre on the autism spectrum like me then itll be worth your money

#####

had a cultivator born with no eyes he grew himself eyes removed said eyes and used them as weapons most badass character in any game ive ever played then he died to a 65 year old man with the face of an 8 year old girl who flew around on a wooden board feng shui has also infected my brain worth it

#####

if rimworld was chinese and was made from pure opium

if you dont know what youre doing dont worry you can make and view public comments on almost everything in the game the clock in the hud grass stat menu god pets you can get a pet that is a god that will do everything you ever wanted it can pee on your crops to make them grow faster and take thousands of damage to protect your village you can become a demigod that kills divine beings and makes drugs out of their corpses you can incorrectly orient and place graves and make them out of wrong materials and end up killing your disciples because evil spirits started scaring them you can take rare untested drugs to reach new heights of godhood you can kill yourself because the feng shui of your training facility wasnt high enough so now your bones are melted you can kill thousands en masse by inviting followers of your religion to your sect and forcing them to pray in a room that is either 2000 or 2000 c and take all their goods

theres even more things you can do that nobody know how or why it happens

#####

im chinese and even i dont know what the f is going on

#####

the game is great fun but

if you do not like relying on guides do not play this game 

perhaps the situation is different if you are hardcore into wuxia and you know that evil sects cultivate earth flux already or stuff like that but before this game i didnt even know what the cultivation genre was

im serious you will rely on guides from the time you start playing all the way until you have beaten the game if at any point you decide to stop following a guide you will be essentially unable to advance in any meaningful way until you go back to the guides

as an example

to do basically anything in the game you need high tier cultivators to get high tier cultivators you need to do many things most of which the game explains well in its tutorial unfortunately you also need to know where to get magical energy rock super plant root and dream snow these names are made up to avoid spoilers you can get all of these in exactly one way you send a reasonably lucky cultivator to one of about 20 exact places repeatedly with each exploration having a small chance to reveal the exact area that has this exact item there are no hints as far as i saw to the location of any of these essential items 

i am legitimately convinced the game would take 1000 hours of spreadsheet keeping to actually find out for yourself where every essential game item is and this example is just for items at every turn there are 10 things the game seems to expect you to just already know in order to progress and it just never stops

following a guide to better understand feng shui or game mechanics in general is fine in my book you learn it once and then you can utilize it yourself but relying on guides 100 of the way through the game or else you just cant do anything at all is just

youre basically not even playing a game at that point in my opinion

to the devs

your game is already very successful and well loved so im not sure you even should make changes based on what i personally want but if i was going to play your game i would need to be able to reasonably do so without looking outside of the game for information maybe you can expand the social dialog system to include hints about how important getting more max qi is for cultivators to get better golden cores or about the whereabouts of certain essential items


additional thoughts after 30 more hours a few years later


my above review still stands basically as before 
if you dont like the thought of being handheld by a guide the entire way this is probably not the game for you

however this game is probably the single best game ive ever played at providing a feeling of deep progression so if the guide thing doesnt bother you or only sometimes bothers you and other times you can deal with it i highly recommend this game

#####

accidentally taught a male disciple a skill meant specifically for female disciples  upon completion his dingdong fell off

not wanting to waste a precious resource i made him refine it into an artifact  now he flies into battle and decapitates enemies with his willy

1010 would accidentally castrate again

#####

tldr pretty amazing game

you will probably be overwhelmed when you start this game there are so many layers of interacting systems and deep mechanics and to make things more confusing the english translation is a bit weird and not terribly easy to follow your followers will probably end up horribly injured by wildlife or die of exposure or even heatstroke because mining igneocopper places them in scorching hot environments and as far as overall plot goes you will probably have next to no idea whats actually going on

i encourage you to stick with it though because it is staggeringly fun once you get the hang of the basics

in essence its a lot like rimworld only instead of building a colony on some strange alien planet youre building a monastery where people can attempt to ascend to godhood by studying supernatural martial arts and philosophies it is extremely like a wuxia film full of esoteric laws of heaven people flying around on magical jade swords and achieving enlightenment through meditation mighty adventures and sometimes practicing calligraphy

there are other important differences from rimworld as if the setting werent already enough for one thing theres a strict hierarchy to any sect you create everyone starts as a beginner and trains in foundation martial arts until theyre ready to become inner disciples and learn one of the many laws which will define their path to immortality when you promote an outer disciple to an inner they stop doing manual labour altogether so be sure you have a backup peasant to cook meals haul materials and craft basic tools or your sect will collapse for lack of workers on the other hand an inner disciple becomes an extremely powerful individual they no longer need to eat living off qi they can create and wield powerful artifacts which act as autonomous weapons and they can learn a multitude of miraculous magical powers such as healing spells changing the weather and more 

each stage of advancement in an inner disciples training involves reaching a limit and attempting to breakthrough this can be as simple as spending a day or two in meditation or it can require a grueling battle against heavenly manifestations of power like a thunderstorm failure can cause injuries or kill the disciple outright so preparation is vital they should be in a good mood have a calm and composed mental state and the local surroundings should be rich in qi and a particular element such as a room made out of fiery or icy materials which brings in its own issues of heat management if they pass the test however their power increases greatly their pool of qi grows they get access to new abilities and their life expectancy grows by several decades an inner disciple can easily oneshot a grizzly bear that might cause an outer disciple to suffer multiple permanent injuries

there are several playable races too the yaoguai are half human half animal and they all have their own unique abilities and disadvantages wolf yaoguai are excellent fighters for example while cat yaoguai get bonuses to fine crafts like tailoring or making talismans but dont like doing crude labour they all have one disadvantage in common which is that at some point they must face a heavenly tribulation which will either make them fully human or devolve them back into the beasts they resemble and unless you know what youre doing from the start your first generation of yaoguai will probably fail turn into powerful demon animals and slaughter your other disciples

what else well there are spirit pets sometimes at random or after a specific adventure you might find an animal you can adopt as a pet these animals are incredibly powerful and will probably be your damage tanks during your sects early days they must be trained though every now and then they will pick an action which you can encourage or discourage are they allowed to eat spoiled meals should they occasionally bite disciples or defecate on someones bed do they search dead enemies for items you can tailor your pets behaviour quite well using this system and when they become an adolescent you can tailor their combat style by selecting a particular diet eating fruit might be good for intelligence where cultivating their inner core is best done on a diet of tubers and so on

but theres more every now and then some wild animal will attain a sliver of understanding and you can fan this into full blown intelligence with a memory game where you collect the shards of experiences the animal has and distill them into fullblown memories and thoughts and then when youre ready they transform into a yaoguai

i could go on and on because even this is only scratching the surface of the games interacting systems each of the laws you can learn have very unique ability sets theres the physical cultivation laws where you train your flesh muscles bones and organs to become an absolutely terrifying combat machine which even lets you regrow lost body parts theres the map of the known world full of adventuring sites villages and cities where you can set up temples to recruit gather resources and experience and affect the greater world as little adventures in those locations prompt a policy response from you there are all the rival cultivation sects good and evil that also adventure throughout the world and which will claim artifacts and treasures if you dont get there first theres the complex feng shui system where building rooms and work stations in a certain way awards bonuses to productivity and theres a whole modding community working on countless additions to the game never mind the devs themselves planning dlc and sequels

rimworld is a lot easier to get into and very much has its own scifiwestern style and gameplay and its a great game theres no denying that but amazing cultivation simulator adds some very niche elements and goes far far deeper into those and has an absolutely gorgeous mythical china wuxia aesthetic and in the end they are both incredibly different games with a similar premise on the surface

acs is bewildering but my god its really bloody good

#####

built my houses too good and became blessed rival sect sent hitmen after me whom wiped me out using a flying piece of reinforced driftwood and desecrated my outer disciples corpses before stealing my money and leaving i was left with one crippled outer disciple and a heavily injured cultivator who slept 100 of the time from depression
they soon died
1010

#####

you know that feeling when you read all those novels manga and you still want more cultivation mc stuff that you barely understand

yeah that

this game helps that feeling

#####

if youre coming from seths video its even more fun than youd think

#####

you are basically founding a magical sect think hogwarts but in a dog eat dog world where the strong takes what they want your sectschool is focused on churning out magical cultivators separated by ranks whom will ascend to the heaven or die trying the initial stages are similar to rimworld but the magical portion and combat are way different

the core mechanic after the initial stages is basically building a place to facilitate the cultivationtraining of your cultivators in the middle stages you will reach the golden orb i forgot what the translation they used where your character will gather qi from nearby area to form a golden orb the more qi there are in the area along with compatible feng shui the better the chance of getting a better grade golden orb 110 with 1 being the best this will largely impact the max qi of the character along with some other stats then you will progress eventually to demi god and and face heavenly tribulations aka thunder will rain from the sky and strike you down before ascension if not earlier and the max qi of your character will play a huge role in determining success or failure

while all of this sounds nice it takes quite a long long time there are many memes out there for the length it takes to ascend in this game prolly 100 hrs if not more on first playthrough some law or paths take longer than others to reach certain stage andor ascend and each have its own strength and weaknesses utility combat abilities etc ascending your characters is not the end as you are playing the sect and not a single character

the main gameplay loop is wait for time to go by while your character are cultivating send some people out one in a while to plunder err i mean gather treasures learn various new laws and some drastically different way of cultivating build up your sect into a power house with multiple demi god then challenge tough creatures andor npc sect they are very very scary

edit
after 500 hours i finally crushed those npc sects on true immortal ix trib

#####

dont start as a yaoguai the gods disapprove of furries

#####

i am writing this review earlier than id usually would and will update it when im further into the game but i feel it is necessary to put down the foot on a few points that i got told about this game and made me start it and saw in a bunch of mostly negative reviews which are after putting 40h into the game are simply  missinformed incompelte nonsense

its  rimworld no it is not youd be more correct saying rpg1 the same as rpg2 the similarities are that you can build things on a square grid from a top down perspective and that there is a work assigment menu for out disciples we might as well call out disciples your interns or minions or unpayed practicants  you see where this is going while they arent irrelevant they arent the point of the game and the outer sect gameplay is more like you cross the early settler games  with rimworld you have much more control about the exact shape of your base but overall the outer sect is realized by scurry factor and again don let this influence you in any way  outer sect is still not the point of the game 

and now to also mention the central point of the basebuilding since i read so many times not enough control its feng shui it is an other rathole in itself which i wont go down too far but lets give an example what this is about most things in the game have an element and those elements have a relation to each other for example water nutures wood but supresses fire yes most of them are obvious so if you have a workplace assoziated with wood then it is great for the room to have a lot of water and if the workplace is fire then it is a really bad idea to have a lot of water around add to that that you should not overcrowd rooms or leave them to empty and for some roomtypes doors need to be in a special orientation eg bedrooms have their door in the south part of the ruleset is quite easy to explain some i dont know why they are like that but in the end the tooltips and help function are good enough to figure it out pretty easily

now to the point of the game it is growing your _inner_ sect disciples which are or should be your valued competent specialists combat force explorers there is an absurd amount of content for that and i have barely scratched its surface crafting equipment level ups which are non trivial and can be optimized a lot its not some exp bar that makes pling level up formations put multiple disciples into one for higher effectiveness  and so many options to build those formations skills in a lot of forms and colours which your disciples can learn 

and all again influenced by feng shui  for your wood typepokemon having a lot of nuturing water around is very helpful the artifactstools are better if their owner can nuture them so ie fire artifact for a wood type quality and chances for level ups are influenced by it 

tldr there is a whole lot that isnt rimworld in fact beside initially looking somewhat similar there really isnt a lot of similarities and i have hundreds of hours in rimworld and the claimed similarity was one of the reasons why i had a look amazing cultivator simulator is a very enjoyable game for me and i recommend it if you are interessted  but being interessted because you want another rimworld isnt the best indicator youd like this game not that i would understand why you arent looking for even more mods in that case anyway

also the price is fine it is currently 21 for the 10 release  i got it for 15 in early access  but after 40 hourse over 2 saves i am starting to dive into a lot of the finer micromanagement aspects which a lot of people complained arent there  they are there you just have to play the game further than deciding its not rimworld and there is still a lot of content to explore

#####

if you know what nascent soul means you will enjoy this game

#####

so lets start with the tldr
the game is excellent if you enjoyed rimworld or oxygen not included youll probably enjoy this

now my fellow daoists for the actual review 
i originally bought it due to my love of xianxia novels and was excited to see the world i love in a video game the trailer looked messy with lots of fire and whatnot flying around but i figured id give it a shot anyways and im glad i did i was expecting rimworld  cultivation but the cultivation element is far deeper than i assumed it would be is it like rimworld undoubtedly are there things rimworld does better definitely there will be times you curse your disciples out because you cant give micromanaged commands like in rimworld but the xianxia elements the magic the feng shui the world alchemy the cultivation all feel like excellent additions that rimworld just doesnt provide theyre not just stapled on gimmicks they provide a breathe of fresh air for anyone who loved rimworld and just wants i struggle to call it a 20 but lets go with a really cool dlc
i was also very impressed with the english translation of the game i was expecting googletranslate but got a translation thats perfectly fine 99 of the time sure every now and then youll get a typo or an explanation that doesnt exactly work but overall its very well done
my review obviously contains lots of references to rimworld and thats because the two are obviously very similar and so comparing one to the other is natural much like tekken vs mortal kombat command and conquer vs starcraft guitar hero vs rockband or league of legends vs dota the parallels between the games are obvious that doesnt mean one is a cheap knockoff of the other they can give you more of the game you already love and thats exactly what amazing cultivation simulator does it gave me more of a game i already love and i hope it does for you too

#####

almost 300 hours into the game and i still only have one achievement i dont even know what a foundation is  my cottom farms keep getting raided by crazy people and people with magic sometimes i survive long enough for a magic dog to save me for awhile but then some dragon comes and eats him

#####

this game was so good i deleted my pirated copy and bought the game and dlc for 30 dollars

#####

played over 300 hours very difficult to get started with but the game allows so much modding via in game and offers a variety of maps that replayability is amazing started multiple games and get screwed by the game while trying to figure it out made some very op characters items and potions to increase the rate of cultivation looking forward to figuring out the endgame components have i mentioned that as of this review i have still not beat the game

story is a bit weak but at least there is no handholding sink or swim just like the real cultivation world mangas 
1010  i have a baby flood dragon growing nicely and a maxed out dog demon

suggestion for beginners 
 create mod items to help deal with the cold and hot weather clothing
 create blueprints for rooms outer disciples can share a room inner disciples need their own room blueprints are a pain at first to figure out the drag and copy feature from the main craft menu but once you do it makes building things much quicker  maybe more for advanced players
 create at least one op character i named mine elon musk lol
 create a potion that speeds up cultivation and max qi
 do not max out your cultivation with a character until you know you will not need himher to defend sect or to fight tough oponents
 get the formation feature as quickly as it is available by finding the dead body of your tayin sect elder and searching his corpse cant fight ancient cultivators or flood dragon without this
 choose the wetlands with that sweet spirit soil and send your inner disciples with high perception all over the map to discover secret locations must do multiple times and multiple places will be revealed so that you can farm minerals from these locations like igniscopper
 carve out a mineral vain veins and build a treasure house away from your sect so that it is safer natural rocks cannot be attacked by inner disciples to my knowledge put some walls inside and a door keep your most precious items here as the flood dragon will attack your main buildings but wont go after remote locations
 build a room with a stove a well and an area that can just hold food and water make this away from your main buildings and put a bell inside of it this is where outer disciples will be sent once the sect is under attack from the flood dragon or others
 click the three dots on items the community is pretty nice to share their discoveries about items and how to take advantage of them

feng shui
 an earth room and doors a steel bed earth furniture around the bed
 a wood room and doors a fire bed wood furniture around the bed
room doors to the south
 a workshop door to the east
 a room with a stove and tables for your disciples click the auto feature allowing them to make their own food feng shui is as explained for rooms above and the door is to the west

mythical seeds and trees
create a room that feeds the nature of the plant so an earth room for the metal tree a fire room for the earth tree and a wood room for the fire tree etc use displays and put the items on top of them people can move around the displays pay attention to the room temperature requirements as they may need to be altered between summer and winter some trees are more prone to be cursed like the fire tree than others like the steel tree
 plant in spirit soil but you may be able to raise them at a slower rate in fertilized soil not really sure
 build rooms around to contain temperature 

this has been too long but a good start good luck cutivators

#####

i barely recommend this game its like a 501 out of 10

at first glance people are going to think to themselves oh its 2d i have many characters they build buildingsit must be like rim world or dwarf fortress no its not

this is a stat collecting game it is not a strategy game in my opinion you will not be fighting tactical combats or laying traps and predicting your enemies routes you wont be choosing between tons of viable options to reach a short term goal what you will be doing is watching movies on your other monitor waiting for x numbers of things to be built x number of adventures your guy going from point a to b and reporting a reward or x number of something else to accumulate it is very much like an asian phone game in that they assume you have an endless amount of real life to burn

sure there are several laws to choose from to start but there really are only two that a so much better than the rest to start with that you are just hurting yourself by not repeating the most obvious and optimal route

many will think this game is very difficult however its not difficult strategically its one of those games that is only difficult because you will have no clue how most of the mechanics work what particular items do or what paths to pursue i have a feeling that once you memorize all of that the game would become quickly boring

that said i am having an ok time with it between my other games i am strangely drawn to the challenge of figuring out htf does this game work i do feel some sense of achievement once i figure out oh you do this to get that there are a lot of mechanics in the game a lot of items and a good number of stats

so what will you be doing in this game

well youll be cultivating your characters of course you build a handful of buildings while minding rules about which side the doors go on and what materials have to be used to appease rules about elements youll build the exact same buildings the exact same way almost every game so its not like other civ building games yes youll be smithing swords and tailoring shirts you will not be creating armies or fighting off hordes

combat at least in the first 100 hours is going to consist of one of your guys running up to some other guy standing there and watching their qi bar or hp bar go down while the game compares stats you dont even move much unless you just want to flee and have someone else tank hits its literally just going to sit there and compare numbers for 510 minutes later on you get formations and spells supposedly but even then i dont think there is much to the combat at all

youll be clicking through mind numbing dialogs in a mini game where all you do is click the lmb to chat until the person likes you enough to give you useful information i dont even look at the screen while clickingits painful

youll be trying to figure out how to get various items that raise stats youll be trying to figure out what stats effect what actions youll quickly find out things like oh people are completely useless without the luck stat because evidently it controls whether you get a reward on most adventures or  oh i need to eat these pills to raise my max qi and max qi determines most of my strength

youll should really expect to completely fail and get no where unless you consult some guides or get on a discord do keep in mind though that a lot of the enjoyment from this game comes from figuring out how to play

the game does not spawn new maps aside from the tiny zone you build in the events npc characters quests etc are all the same every play so i dont know how much replay there will be you can go down different paths to enlightenment i suppose its super slow paced so i dont know if i will want to replay before something else comes out that takes my attention well have to see

all in all its not horrible but it isnt something ill be talking about 3 years from now
they could make it much better with bigger maps procedural generation of other sects and their maps characters etc it really could use a more involved and exciting combat system i generally just need more to keep my attention while playing so i dont find myself watching movies on the second monitor

pick it up for the price figure it out hop on the discord but keep your expectations in line

#####

firstly dont even consider the first review by a chinese game developer who give this game a bad review it just his way to reduce this game sales to raise his own game who knows in the other hand for someone who played rimworld i clearly state that this game is different in many ways they have a same gameplay yes but the contents are really really different if you a wuxia or xianxia fans then this game is a must meanwhile there are many contents that yet to release and from the roadmap im sure this game able to reach 3k  4k upvote if they have an update

and hopefully the devs able to release the official english translation sooner since the global pandemic of covid19 lets pray the devs team are okay and able to develope this game more

hey hey people sseth brought me here



yes the game is great you can harvest d 1010

ive seen many reviews comparing this acs to rimworld it may seem very similar at a glance but the similarities end when you actually dive into the game i will cover the differences later in this review
i can say that i loved rimworld but i am currently enjoying acs even more there is a lot more to explore and uncover when you get into it but it does start a little slow i feel like it is less stressful than rimworld because you arent getting hit with a catastrophe one after another
the cultivation aspect is the main focus of this game which sets it apart from rimworld it is so complex that i cannot fit it into this review the base building is highly influenced by a feng shui mechanic so you cant just put everything anywhere
it helps to have some knowledge about wu xia which makes the game more enjoyable in my opinion go read some translated chinese manhua like apotheosis if you havent read any
the game does lack quality of life features compared to rimworld especially around managing your people and items but the game is in early access so maybe they will be addressed at some point the gameplay more than makes up for it
the learning curve in this game is huge it took me hours to get through all of the tutorials and even afterwards i didnt know what i was doing and had to trial  error everyone in the official discord is extremely helpful if you have any questions
i would recommend not looking too deeply into guides that handhold you worrying about min maxing your characters early on takes away a lot of the fun exploring what the game has to offer is where a lot of the fun comes from 
the official discord community is extremely helpful so be sure to check it out im sure you will have questions
the beta translations are decent and definitely playable you will have to join the official discord and check the pinned post to get the steam beta access code

unote that there is a lot to mention about this game but not enough room to put in this reviewu

h1overall flowh1
in rimworld youre constantly thrown catastrophes based on the storyteller which tests your ability to survive acs is less of focused on surviving and more focused on cultivation i was initially let down because i thought the game was too easy i never had food problems i one shot everyone whenever i got raided it felt like too simple of a game until you uncover everything else this game has to offer 
rimworlds end goal was to get from point a to point b and defend for some time acs seems more like a cultivation sandbox

h1difficulty scalingh1
acs scales based on your reputation reputation changes based on decisions you make if youre too active or you piss off a sect faction due to an action you took it may become difficult quickly

h1character typesh1
all characters start out as outer disciples in acs they perform all of the chump labor such as cooking cleaning hauling farming mining general crafting hunting etc you can choose to promote the outer disciples to inner disciple whenever you want once they have trained enough and built their foundation once they are inner disciple they wont be able to perform any of the activities that the outer disciples performed they will have gained new cultivation options as well as access to artifact crafting alchemy miracles traveling in the world map etc they will also start flying around and start attacking with artifacts which they control in the air like magic almost every item in the game can be transformed into an artifact including poop

h1recruiting disciplesh1
there is a final cap of 36 disciples max in acs it is a lot easier to get new people in acs but hard to find someone with really good stats

h1moodh1
less demanding compared to rimworld and can affect a characters cultivation speed if an outer disciples mood is too low they will start slacking but they dont have a breaking point you dont have to bury enemy corpse in this game as they have no effect on the mood

h1world maph1
the world map is not a grid like rimworld you just select points of interest on the map you dont form caravans in acs you dont really take stuff with you but you can put items in one of your 6 equip slots per character which you can offer another character to gain their favor food is not an issue when travelling 
when you select an area of interest on the map you have options to adventure camp and enter 
adventure will send an inner disciple to an area and you will get a text event you will either get resources or a statrng check for other rewards
camp will keep your character there until you manually recall them and they will receive a random event every couple of days camp is also the easiest way to actually enter a map
you can perform trades instantly from the world map as well without sending someone out but you may need a good relationship with them to get higher tier items from them		

h1cultivationh1
cultivation is the crux of the game but its huge and complex there isnt enough room in this review to cover it

h1feng shuih1
most items walls objects and buildings will emit a feng shui aura within a certain range the aura emitted can be wood fire water earth and metal then there are specific feng shui buildingsobjects like a bed which will receive that aura if you build a room with wood walls then you want the the bed that you place next to that wall to be built with fire material because fire overcomes wood if you choose the wrong element the bed can become ominous if it is a fully established room then that bed also affects the feng shui of the entire room if you have a disciple living in a very ominous room it will affect their mood and they can randomly die on the other hand if the room has good feng shui they use the term auspicious it can increase the rate that you gain cultivation exp in that room

h1establishing powerh1
there are spots on the world map where you can send an outer disciple to establish a type of base which the game refers to as power you only interact with these established powers using menus if it is established in a field it can harvest resources which you can collect daily powers established in cities can recruit disciples and influence believers which generate inspiration skill exp daily power also generate random text events which involve stat checks of the disciples at that power correctly addressing the issue will generate believers or resources

h1annoyancesh1
list
assigning work is difficult you can tell them to be a logger and cut trees but after that they do whatever you allow them to
you cannot restrict areas where you dont want them to be
item filters are not as granular as rimworld
hard to manually control characters they will immediately go back to what they were doing
the music is good but for 90 of the game i am sitting in silence
you cant really hear sound effects unless you are fully zoomed in
your character stops attacking enemies once they are unconscious there is no reason not to kill them as far as i know
cannot force an outer disciple to work on a specific task
too much trial and error in this game and requires you to seek the community for answers for example there is an event where an elf shows up and you would never know what to do with it unless ask or look it up
majority of the money you make comes from selling stuff for 1 at high quantity this needs to be reworked too many items sell for just 1
a lot of rng and stat checks in the world map events
if you have an iron item in queue to be crafted but you have no iron that queue is stuck until you get iron it will not attempt to craft the next item in queue

i want to be honest i hate this game
considering my hours i pretty much want to love it 

this game is no joke and the rng can be pretty heavy i have had bad stuff happening to me friends which also play the game deemed to be impossible well it is possible and the most hilarious events can happen on a daily basis more experienced players surely find their ways to worm out of situations or know exactly what they are doing at any point im telling you you wont most of the time this game is so complex and filled with secrets and mysteries to the brim that the difference between someone knowing what they are doing and somebody who knows not might look like this

might or might not be a bit overexaggerated but close to reality
player that doesnt know what they are doing oh day 30 everyone has shelter food and i have a running place now

player that knows what they are doing day 30 i insta teleported into some secret place wresled some demons obtained secret laws i stole from places god even doesnt know and i did all this without anyone knowing it was me i have cultivated the highest tier for my soul the world doesnt even know i exist but i am on the way of becoming a god

the latter having a tremendously higher survival chance as well you can turn down difficulty a lot but if you play on ironman immortal which is also the only way to farm steam achievements for this game the scaling of this game becomes ridiculous 

frustrating even even if you think youre be doing well always keep in mind there is always one bigger fish than you in that ocean that is this game if you think having a king of magic is fancy and you think youre doing well think again 

you can easily watch him being mauled to death by enchanted feces while the other attacker manages to decapitate the entire rest of your place with his flying bucket of water dont ask me how that works but it does

and all of that just happened because i didnt know stuff secrets or how to approach things things to tremendously increase my survival chances the next time every time you die and lose your entire savegame you learned more

its an abusive experience this game beats you senseless but youll keep coming back 

have i mentioned that i do hate this game
its really good

#####

hey hey people

#####

an evil warlord cursed me and now my mind is enslaved by this horrible game one that feeds on autism and only elevates it into a higher plain of suffering

#####

i feel like a foreigner trying to play this game 1010 wuxia simulator love that everything in the game has a board to socialize with other players like a forum to ask what this itemthing means and get descriptions from players who understand it very well for a single player game i love features like that very community based good game sseth brought me here

#####

after reading tons of cultivation webnovels finally found a game that gives me a feel for those moments the pain of preparing for golden core the amount of resources necessary for immortal cultivation etc etc 

love the fact that it also covers body cultivation and shendao laws as well

game can be as shallow or as deep as youd want it to be even after a couple of weeks still discovering nuggets of info that deepens the game experience

super fun and really recommended

#####

hey hey people

#####

the base game is rimworld id throw a dubious look at anyone claiming otherwise if you are good atunderstand the depths of rimworld congrats it means the early game in this will be rather easy

some hours in im noticing a departure from rimworlds  way of doing things and some of the systems in this game are deeper than any comparable system in rimworld everything having to do with magicqi is far and away deeper than say psychic stuff in rimworld

but there is something charming about this game rimworld honestly puts me off sometimes with how brutal it can be and how frankly nihilistic it is amazing cultivation simulator has an entirely different ethos under the hood and i think thats an improvement

some of the game systems dont make intuitive sense coming from an american culture but that doesnt matter most things are documented well enough

if youve played rimworld use that as your baseline for how to feel about this game understand its not a 11 comparison but its close

if you havent played rimworld i suppose i should acknowledge this review is useless to you im not about to fix that im out of time to write

#####

despite the number of hours i have listed i cant think of anyone whom i would recommend try it except imaybei for fans of xianxiawuxia literature

first before i get into the actual review let me help some folks out with a very simple remark if you like to try before you buy by taking advantage of the steam refund window dont bother with this game you cannot get even an idea of what the game is all about in 2 hours so if youre really on the fence about spending the money on it just dont i dont consider this to be the games fault its just how it is

moving on this review is not negative because of a lack of polish substance flavor or stability there are some problems along these lines but theyre pretty modest let me give a few examples anyway

the translation and ui have some significant faults as just one example of this there is no way to read why feng shui modifiers described as just bedroom or workshop are actually good or bad it turns out that these lines are based on the direction that the door faces matching up with whats inside the room the game does explain how doors into various rooms should face but this ui element does very little to help you know whether you did it right

similarly the tutorials even though there are an unbelievable number of them and each is separately done pretty well do not really come together into a coherent picture of what you wantneed to do why you wantneed to do it and how you actually do it the tutorials are more like here is how you do this thing but they provide very little context for what that thing is for or even how far into the game it will first come into play this is only partially caused by the complexity of the game it is also caused by the overall tutorial experience not being very well thought out

the tutorials and the ingame tips when you reach certain milestones are often redundant to each other this can make it feel like it was kind of a waste of time to do the tutorials at all especially in the early stagesand when doing less than half of the tutorials takes well over an hour thats a pretty significant problem

for just one more negative detail before i get to the main point i want to mention that this games social system is the most unbelievably tedious and pointless thing i have ever seen in any game i dont even know how to explain how terrible it is so if you want to know about it just go watch ssethtzeentachs review which is generally positive but is quite negative on this point there is a cheaty mod that basically lets you bypass the entire system though

despite everything i said above and other issues along the same lines there is actually quite a bit of good stuff here at the very least there is enough for me to get past the issues with the translation ui and tutorials there is not enough to make me willing to bother with the social system but there is a lot you can do without touching that and again you can more or less bypass it with a mod if you want to actually experience the games story what little of it there actually is

with all that said the main thing i wanted to say with this review is that although this game eventually gets good if you give it the time the amount of time it takes to get good is excessive as is the relatively low amount of enjoyment that you get in the meantime ive already sunk the time in so i can sort of enjoy it now but in those early stages i was honestly paying more attention to the shows i was watching on the other screen than to the game 

most of this it takes too long to get good feeling is not really related to the pace of the game when you already know how to play indeed i suspect people playing established rush strategies can keep things moving at a pretty good clip right from the start instead it is mostly related to the pace of the game while you are still learning things 

now why isnt this learning experience fun to be sure part of it is that the game is too hard to learn but a game being hard to learn just drags out the learning experience i could be ok with that if learning the game were fun which in some games it is but in acs rather than having a fun experience of unraveling complex and nuanced systems your learning experience mostly amounts to asking a bunch of questions about seemingly complex mechanics which ultimately have objectively correct answers this is especially true earlier in the game 20 hours into the game you start to see some nuance 

in some rare cases the straightforwardness of solutions is related to balancing issues where one solution to a problem is vastly superior to another in every way for example there is basically no reason to actively farm inspiration the currency used to teach cultivators new skills by using the train mode because you can obtain inspiration much more than 10 times faster by using your agencies but in most cases getting these questions answered is just what the game is about

to put it another way despite its sandbox appearances this is a game that can be largely spoiled by a guide here are a few examples of what i mean by that there are optimal ways to build rooms each location has a static pool of resources and a static exploration map which means that the availability of various resources is basically the same in every game changing your local map doesnt really change all that much nor does the order you discover maps when you explore the storyline is scripted even the names of the important characters are fixed so for example the first person you hear about in the story will always be yue qingchou and shes always a member of the same sect there are standard tactics to keep your reputation from rising too high so that you crush every invader you are likely to see unless you crank the difficulty way up but if you do crank the difficulty up when you are pretty new at the game learning the concepts will take ieven longeri

i could give more examples but i think you get the point overall it takes lot of effort to learn these secrets on your own whether you view that effort as a huge grind or a fascinating journey is a matter of taste but i started finding it to be a real chore as soon as i had any idea how to play once you know a good portion of these secrets i have already seen that there is a fairly deep management game embedded in here but without a guide it takes dozens of hours to learn enough to access that game when youve learned that much whether you used a guide or not you see just how shallow many of this games ostensibly complex systems really are

#####

you install the game shortly after you realize that a simpleton such as yourself cant begin to fathom the deep complexity of feng shui you take to the internet only to realize that you picked the cumfart law instead of the obvious 10000iq play that is picking something your character is good at you restart with all your new found knowledge and become a feng shui master everything is auspicious in the jeffery dahmer fanclub cave as it should be you grow ever more powerful by crafting poop harvested from your very own colonists into artifacts that could slay something eventually you hit the golden core stage on your sect leader and think to yourself golden core 9 must be the best surely bigger is better after all one month later the demonic cum sect send a hit squad after you for insulting their estranged 34rd cousins cactus a common mistake they wipe you off the face of the mountain and it is time to start again after watching 9 hours of gameplay tutorials you are ready surely this is the run your path to immortality is carved in stone and you are but a humble retard tending to your flock this time everything is perfect this is the run youve been preparing for when suddenly you misclick and accidentally feed a spirit crystal to david blane#3 instead of a spirit stone causing him to explode spectacularly with no rebirth pill available you lose the only cultivator in the sect with a straight shot to immortality another restart later a powerful yaogui spawns on the map with you so you decide the mysterious cultivator can kill it for you for that sweet sweet free loot only to realize after you aggrod it that the mysterious cultivator is using an unfinished game of go as his only weapon the fight drags on for 12 hours a legendary brawl that shall be sung about for the ages to come when suddenly the mysterious cultivator dies and you have a pissed off spirit bear eating your colonists and wipe on day 3 before you finish a single bedroom this is a game for the worthy and you my friend are not it

#####

this is one of those games i will never play again simply because i cannot control myself its going in the vault for my own sanity if you are unemployed and do not plan on changing that pick up cultivation simulator

#####

you have to cultivate for 5000 years in real life before youre allowed to play this game

hey hey people

#####

tldr game is very very good recent negative reviews as of writing this are for something else the game itself is unaffected

for anyone confused about the recent reviews theyre so negative because chinese players are at the time of writing this review protesting the state of the mobile version of this game it apparently has a subscription fee things like that hence the recent negative reviews the game itself is still great and unaffected by this dont worry pick this one up

i did a quick video review on this game httpsyoutubeqdsyyhbfjuw
text version of the video review below

after playing this game for quite some time i can fully recommend it in a nutshell acs is one of the deepest and richest sandbox rpg games ive encountered so far it has a knack towards base building but its completely different to titles like rimworld it shares a similar base design but acs leans way heavier towards character development world exploration and fantasy story telling

pros about this game are its insane depth a very cuddly and wholesome graphics style which also has a pretty high quality standard on top of that its moddable and therefore theres no ceiling to the content of the game everything makes sense is very well fleshed out and offers hours and hours of interesting content if you are into eastern fantasy

the cons are steep learning curve as hell a pretty clunky ui which is at times mildly infuriating and a translation which leads to misunderstandings and confusions at times the third part is something i am pretty sure will be gone in a few monthsyears dont get me wrong the translation is solid but its noticeable that there still needs work to be done
the learning curve is what i consider the heaviest downside of the game you really gotta dig deep into the game to actually enjoy it but thats also a pro  if you dislike shallow or too easy games in general

my summary absolute recommendation 
albeit its quirks the game is one of the deepest and richest experiences ive had in 2020 and i dont think the devs will stop here the game is moddable translation work from chinese takes some time though so we are sure gonna see a lot more stuff in the coming years 
if you have doubts  check out a few gameplay videos and decide for yourself if the gamestyle scratches your itch cause the game sure is quite eccentric but if you get past its hard shell its an adorable simulator which gives you so much freedom of design and choices  its awesome

bing chilling

#####

i turned a piece of dog poop into a magic weapon and now one of my cultivators flies around on a sword hurtling poop at people until they die

#####

well after reading all the different cultivation stories through novels and mangas there is finally a game where you can experience a similar world
what more can you wish more

#####

i have no idea what i am doing 1010

#####

this game is built around the notion of being a colony management simulator that focuses on cultivation as the uniting point for all the characters in the game cultivation can be defined as the process of trying to acquire or develop a quality or skill to which we can further define in the context of the game as cultivating our body and spirit towards godhood essentially we are in a martial arts and cultivation themed world ordering around npcs that have the focal commonality and driving force to cultivate into godhood and presumably immortality by any means necessary yes we can be benevolent or evil 

i do not presume to hold the entirety of the games knowledge and all of its systems and i actually found the best source of knowledge in this game comes from their discord group linked on the steam page and the comments people can leave on each of the games items 

on surface level people may see it as an easier survival mode rimworld clone but this is only on the surface beneath this lies systems about elemental balance pet evolution animal sentience natural disaster management outpost management politics with our sects a relationship simulator between npcs and some lighthearted pvp the development of your characters revolves around a law you pick to cultivate your character after your character has developed their body foundation enough to be able to handle further development some examples of cultivation laws are laws that focus on the mind a city builder in your characters head including population control gimmicks body building bone structure muscle and organ development and the development of your core to be able to ascend your spirit each law also has different spells or skills that help with battle colony management and character stats to be able to successfully develop a law one should opt for a law that has a good affinity with the characters stats and be aware of the games systems such as the elemental affinity and feng shui that will help aid cultivators in their pursuit of godhood

overall i went in for the similarity it had to rimworld but discovered an even greater game my opinion that seems to be polished quite well and i urge newcomers to not get disheartened by the seemingly big learning curve and depth because the game can be easy and it rewards you with new discoveries the further you go into it 

achievements are enabled by immortal mode cheats are not needed since there is an ingame item and character editor on the main menu and if you discover anything or need any help do not forget to share it with other people in the group discord but please be patient

 i wish you all a pleasant gaming experience

#####

no idea what im doing

#####

ssethtzeentach was right this game is rimworld with fengshui base

#####

highly recommend if you enjoy sophisticate open world simulator games like rimworld and kenshi but be careful this one is harder
the learning curve of this game is long and hard to climbyou will need help from community im not sure how well the english community of this game is if you cant find one good luck
but when you learn how to manage your sect after earlygameafter you have first golden core realm character an entire brave new world is open to you 
the first hour of the game is very much like rimworld dont let that fool you in this game your purpose is to build a strong sect and at least let some of your character achieve immortalitynot survive to do so you need carefully build strong characters depends on their various functions travel through distant bizarre territory to look for rare material and medicine which you character needs to break through the next realm you also need to build better equipment research their function and make sure they fit your needthis games equipment system follows a very different logic compares to other games
 there are much more  this game has a system depth i rarely see through my years of game experience and they all works unlike many other early stage games on steam 
again highly recommend it is the only cultivation simulator game in this world and it is doing more than good enough

#####

for when rimworld just seems too straightforward

#####

if you are not a very very patient player this game is not good for you here are a few cons
1 yes this game has rich content but the developer did not give a detailed instruction to every mechanism the simple instructions in the game is not enough for you to beat the game i have to frequently searching online for my questions this would waste new players a lot of time 500hrs to fully understand this game
2 the game is overly complicated and exhausting to play with especially when your sect start to have 36 members taking care of each person is a challenging mission you have to frequently pause the game and check everyones status too much micromanagement the game itself lacks freeinghand mechanism after you upgrade your sect the game developer should not expect every players to searching for mods to relief their hands
3 the info collection is a pain in the ass which you have to talk with a lot of npcs really a lot this should be optimized to a easier style do not tell me there is a mod its not good enough also the task of solving certain mysteries has completely no hints or clues very confusing



#####

omg this game has turned me into a sects maniac

seriously though in a year of pretty good games this one takes the crown rimworld in basic mechanics but with a slow less panic driven pace and a huge amount more depth and features its fairly obvious this game has been out a while in china before being translated because of the huge amount of content and polish

this is going to keep me busy for a long while top game

#####

lets be clear about one thing this is not rimworld its not even remotely close to it in fact it is literally a different genre

this is going to be confusing to players that only played it for the first 2 or so hours the beginning of the game is almost like a palette swap clone of rimworld and naturally everyone tries to play it like one then these people get really confused after they actually start the real part of the game when you start to get inner disciple and wonder why nothing youve learned from rimworld works here

rimworld is a survival builder focused on surviving the next escalating raid or harsh random event this is a grinding character raising rpg builder the focus on the game is to grind the strongest character that you can and collect the best items that character can gather ascend then raise a even more powerful next generation eventually you use those characters to defeat the powerful bosses defeat other sects and conquer the world 99 of the games mechanic takes place after you move away from the rimworld aspect of the game so if you are wondering why your inner disciples cant do manual task thats because you shouldnt focusing on that at all just leave a few workers permenantly as outer

now that said the mechanics in this game is so complex and so random that you will need multiple 100 page guides to fully understand and optimize it is debatable on rather these are actually good mechanic at all but even without over optimizing there is enough unique mechanic that it literally took me 100 hours just to understand the game let alone optimize for it so at least i got my money worth of fun out of it

#####

after 134 hours of playing this game it is safe to assume that i still have no clue what im doing 1010

#####

never have i enjoyed a game i barely understood how to play so much boot up your web browser and gather the online guides because your journey into cultivation is about to begin it will be full of your disciples blood sweat and tears but you will eventually build something slightly resembling a sect only to have the enemies attack and lose it all then you start over again building things a little better a little faster and a little more prepared for the next wave of sect exterminating foes when you finally feel you have the basic grasp of the concepts behind the game you can switch from the classic survival mode to immortal mode and have the game double the difficulty wipe those tears away and get started again because nobody ever said the path to immortality was supposed to be easy

#####

we all know why we are here we saw seths review and thought okay lets give it a go

23 hours later i have a sentient rock that eats poo and everyone is having a mental breakdown

#####

although a timeconsuming game in a very fun way there are timed events that can and will ruin hours spent playing unless you play a specific and certain way
its not a pleasant or interesting challenge for me personally and its what ultimately made me quit this otherwise very enjoyable game

if you dont mind that kind of design and enjoy a wuxia setting this game will keep you going for many hours

#####

im basically exactly the type of person this game was made for i really enjoy rimworld im a fan of chinese cultivation webnovels and ive really wished for there to be games about cultivation 

from a survival aspect the game is very simple compared to rimworld im pretty sure your mortal characters just get sick from eating dirt instead of actually starving youll eventually get healing spells and craft medicinal pills that make any wound thats not immediately fatal pretty negligible 

the real meat of the game comes in the cultivation systems acs has a lot of systems that it doesnt explain in depth its up to you to figure it out or more likely scour the official discord for guideshelp to kind of figure it out 

it can get grindy if you get into trying to make your characters as powerful as possible which i mean is basically the point of the game managing feng shui  the five elements can be a fun task when trying to buildoptimize the layout of your sect 

if youve ever played rimworld and thought i wish i could just train my characters to become really powerful acs might be for you 
if youre into wuxiaxianxiachinese cultivation novels then acs might be for you 
if youve ever wanted to play a game that make it feel like youre training up characters that could fit into dbz acs might be for you

im following a guide and i still dont know what im doing

#####

every time you start this game your elder ancestor coughs blood

#####

this is great 40 hours in and im nowhere close to beating it however i might take a break from it though

this game is based off chinese mythology and various works about immortal cultivators xianxia and is also clearly inspired by rimworld the thing is rimworld looks like a small arcade game in compraison

this really is a simulator rules and mechanics are obscure theres a lot of depth things on purpose arent clearly explained you have to figure them out figuring them out is fun at the same time you can take it slow and lay low without being assaulted by bazillion of enemies right away

the premise is that youre one of the few survivors or the sole survivor of destroyed taoist sect youve survived the destruction and are now trying to rebuild and advance on path of cultivation which basically means gaining superhuman abilities and then if youre lucky perhaps reaching immortality if you can that is to do that you practice a lawa set of traditions that grants you more powers

reaching immortality and gaining power is not easy because everything interacts with feng shuis five elements and theres matter of dealing with qi five elements fire earth metal water wood are organized in such way that one that one element is empowered by another element and at the same time it is supressed by one more element so if your law involves a specific element and youre sitting in a room full of items made out of incompatible element youre going to have a bad time

untangling all those rules is a lot of fun at the same time playing this game explains a lot of things youd encounter in chinese cultivation works comics novels because the picture of the world is quite grim mortals toil to support powerful cultivators who fool around to maintain sane mental state and when they arent doing that theyre sitting on their room in lotus pose while the mortals are digging soil farm vegetables and raise buildings for those lazy superhumans slaving away with a tiny hope of ever bein allowed to step onto the path of immortality themselves but at the same time those superhumans are capable of creating talismans using alchemy creating artifacts and performing miracles some of those miracles come with terrible price like devouring lifespan and in the end most of them die being destroyed by tribulations a test bestowed upon you by the heavens to see if youre worthy of your power killed by demonic beasts and other cultivators normal animals gain sentience sometimes and turn into yaoguai  halfhuman halfanimal monsters and theyre racing against clock desperately trying to amass enough power so they can overcome their own tribulation which will come quite soon 

this is fascinating and the whole t hing made many things ive seen in novels click



all things considered id say this game is amazing but is not for everybody if you want easy victory or clear mechanics this is not for you because keeping things obscure is kinda the point it is also translated from chinese and has multiple minor issues with ui and occasional odd translation here and there

also there is one bad part in the game the chat minigame it is utterly terrible 

it is also a bit unfortunate that they retained rimworlds top down view even though the game uses 3d models unlike rimworld id love to see this in isometry 

so the bottom line if you ever had interest in chinese xianxia novels this is definitely worth checking out

#####

start the game knowing nothing
get a tier 9 golden core thinking you rule
figure out its the worst there is
figure out that door placement is important
figure out the depths of feng shui
figure out theres more than just xiandao golden core cultivation
figure out theres a whole diplomatics game in there as well
figure out theres a talisman minigame as well which you also need for proper character growth
figure out that theres a whole storytalking minigame as well
figure out that you only get achievmentswhen playing on immortal so no save scumming
figure out that theres no proper wiki for this game even though you totally need it because where the fuck do you get holy stone
figure out that most of the time your inner disciple is not in the base but instead out and about adventuring to get those rare qigathering ressources
figure out that you probably still need to figure out a lot more to efficiently play the game

i recommend figuring out that you also like this game

amazing i dont understand anything

#####

my sect leader was so tired of being old and full of wrinkles that i did her a huge favor by making her possess the body of a 14 yearold child giving her the youth she wanted amazing cultivation simulator goes hard no cap 

#####


i shall conquer the realm of immortality at the momment i am 237 hours in my arduous journey and have earned the right to have my beautifull sect decimated by a gang of angry turtles the way of the dao is trully filled with wonder


#####

so dont believe this game is anything like rimworld it looks like it yes but it is nothing like it in fact if you know nothing about cultivation i wouldnt recommend this game however i do recommend this game and ill explain why the game is well made it is a good game its just not for everyone who cant put the time in because this will probably take hours for it to really get good 

about the game this is a survival management game with chinese cultivation added into the mix 

points of the game which i feel you should know before buying

short version complicated complex and might be hard for anyone who doesnt understand chinese cultivation or expects the game to be easyrimworld you will definitely get your moneys worth out of the game otherwise and if you choose to stick with it 

long version 
cultural barrierfor the western world this game suffers a cultural barrier that folks in other parts of the world may not understand and get hung up on some of the terms or how the flow of the game works the tutorial does a good job of showing you how to do things but it does not explain the flow of the game very well which i feel is important due to the complexity of the needs of your disciples and knowing where to go next 

complexities everything is very well detailed and there are alot of little and big things in the game that requires a lot of trial and error the needs of your disciples is alot more than food and water there is a spiritual aspect of the game you need to keep an eye on plus you have tons of commands sects orders and tools youll have to go over and learn as you go by in the game its a really long list

tutorial its really long not pointless but it doesnt explain the flow of the game well enough it does a really good job of telling you how to do something and explaining it but it doesnt tell you when you need to use this or why you would need to do this there isnt a tutorial map that can hold your hand through an example of the flow which i think is what would discourage many from continuing the game while the idea of the game looks fun its also too complicated to understand without an example to go off of go to youtube and watch someone play it really 

once you get the flow the game is slow it takes a really long time to find a good place build decent sustainability build your sect up and progress to those dragons you see on the trailer like it might take hoursdays so dont expect to play this within steams refund policy to know if you like this or not

#####

i am now chinese

#####

i planted some trees for food but one become sentient and now it hops around and eats stuff
1110 would get bouncing pet tree again

#####

just as a lot of people say its kinda like rimworld the basics are the same but this is a whole new game
if you want to play this game be prepared to lose often a lot of people

tldr  game is gold if youre willing to put in the time even though there are some problems here and there

so what are the pros and cons 

pros 
 in game wiki

 in game forum kinda on every item people location and so on you can see the comments of people playing the game helping each other out or memeing their way into the game

 lots of content from different cultivation laws to races to mythical stuff

 sect management you obviously micro manage your inner and outer disciples but as your sect grows bigger you need to expand create branches that gives bonuses create shrines in the neighboring locations to get more resources and so on

 difficulty its a pro for me but it might be a con as its really hard to understand everything you wont ascend to demigod on your first game trust me mine ended when two cultivators from another sect were angered and one shotted everyone in my sect dont anger too much people in the beginning

 just overall feels like your favorite manwha

cons 
 music sometimes the game stops the music even if youve set it to loop endlessly cause yes you can set how often the musics should loop which is actually nice making the game like a bit dead

 difficulty as i said above the game is really difficult just one misstep and you wipe your own guild

 secrets there are in game secrets and mysteries but making progress on them is soooooooo long it might get boring and you just forget about it

 interactions with other sects and people it might feel a bit tough in the beginning if you want to learn some stuff about people you need to ask the person youre talking too about every single damn thing you want to learn the favorites of a sect leader  this is how it goes 
chat and gift until youre at 60 of favor discuss about the sect leader if he knows something hell say so discuss about the thing he said he knew discuss about the sect leader again until the dude says  i dont know who is it  cause yeah after learning weaknesses personnal treasures all their favorites and dislikes their location you dont know who that person is

 in game wiki even though its nice to have one it might feel a bit empty from time to time

 physical cultivators way too overpowered i have one he single handedly defeat each and every wave my enemies sent to attack me until now

there might be some other pros and cons that i havent explored yet like formations sect wars divinity and shendao laws but yeah if youre hesitating cause you like this kinda game but feel a bit lost about it dont

edit  
after some small added game time only 110 hours or so i can add some stuff 

about shendaos thats fun feels like a game in the game where you have to manage your divine palace funny
about physical cultivators theyre not too overpowered its even more than that i even saw a guide on the internet telling you how to make one in 300 days or so that can solo sects

anyway not really much to add just go for it its really one the best game i played recently

#####

i have learned a lot about doors and why they shouldnt face north

#####

its 2am and the game just gave me an achievement for staying up too late playing this game is amazing

#####

let me write the write this game from a player point of view 
first thing this is not rimworld this is rimworld this is not rimworld 
the first one hour feels like rimworld but once you have your first inner disciple the game changes drastically in about 2 hours if you want good stats for your first inner disciple use your first bottle of forming pills properly nudge  your inner disciple is the key to becoming super strong sect and you have to use them as collector for different material fighter against different attackers and heros for different quests yes there are rpg style quest inside and you have to make people happy or fight them in order to proceed through
 
unlike rimworld where it is all about scifri survival this game is about mystical training and stats build the way to build different things is very different from rimworld there is no fridge to build but you build a fridge room by building a room using water element material and put a water element holy relic in the middle you start with a water element room but it is not cold enough where do you get that holy relic quest
 
the learning curve is steep as hell i know chinese culture like back and forth but i have read through thousands of forums to understand wtf is going on there are fushun problem from the start and you have to balance your building material with temperature how to make your little guy have a high temperature tolerance get a fulu or talisman to improve temperature tolerance

you can cultivate your animal turns human cultivator which is kind of interesting after 160 hours in this game i have not explore this part yet neither have i finish the rpg part this game is deep i recommend this game but you need to put some effort into it otherwise this game is not for you 

i hope to write some tutorial in english for this game so that more people can enjoy this  anyone knows where to do it


#####

just promoted my first inner disciple and i had to move her to a different room because the wood of the room was suppressing her earth element and destabilizing her mental state which prevented her from properly cultivating rebuilt her a room from brownstone and tinkered with it until the feng shui was properly auspicious and shes doing much better now

910

took one off the score because unless theres some heavy action on the screen i found the audio to be pretty lacking sometimes i find myself checking to make sure my computer isnt muted other than that amazing game for people that really like digging down into the minutia of deep and complex systems

#####

rimworld in xianxia genre on the first look its a rimworld ripoff but if you play it long enough youll see that theres so many differences it doesnt feel like rimworld at all

the games strength is also its downside if youre a fan of wuxiaxianxia novels  grab this game right now if not then youd probably be better off playing rimworld

#####

this game is terrifyingly addictive  its like rimworld with more rpgish stats and a big emphasis on making individual characters scary  i dont normally play these types of games for long but this one has really set its hooks in and i have apparently already done 61 hours  send help

only complaint is that there are a good number of mechanics that arent explained at all and you have to sort of seat of your pants it or ask on the discord

edit you can teach your guy a skill that makes his dick fall off then enchant that dick into an artifact and use it to kill people  use a skill to regrow the dick make him rebirth and learn the skill that makes his dick fall off again then enchant that one  continue until he has 6 magical dicks that will bludgeon everyone to death  game is good peepeemancer best class

#####

the best fun ive had without lowering my social credit score

#####

this is a great game unfortunately im already getting a bachelors degree right now so i dont have time to pursue one in unofficial traditional chinese literature if you do then this is the game for you

#####

its complex theres a lot of fun stuff to figure out secrets to explore but

the game doesnt really feel like its built for exploring those secrets the interface for some gamecritical concepts like the feng shui system isnt very well suited for playing around with it when it comes to developing characters with spells and all things get very micromanagementy very quickly and it pulls focus away from developing these elite few megacool characters and exploring their abilities and pushes it onto stat grinding and searching for just the abilities that let you grind in a particular way

i feel like this game could be a lot better than it is but if youre into chinese fantasy or xianxia novels its probably worth playing if youre not you might have a better time with other complex games

am i going to keep playing yeah but thats with a lot of frustrations around the way the game is put together

this game is about pursuing immortality and due to the way time works youd be lucky to get through 1 year of your immortals severalcentury lifespan in a days full play thats disappointing and makes me feel like the game wasnt really designed with its subjectmatter in mind it feels more like it evolved out of a simpler game design that got featurecreeped into having all this cool stuff but integrating all the coolness together just didnt quite work

#####

i can feel myself turning chinese

#####

910 game for those who already enjoy wuxia or have a profound knowledge of chinese history and mythology
710 for those who arent the above
all in all this a great game the graphics are beautiful the soundtrack is amazing and all my ads are now in chinese

#####

while this somewhat look like rimworld the gameplay is not the same and for me more interesting than rimworld


#####

a lot more goofy one of my guys turned into a big snake and killed everyone in my sect

#####

i highly recommend buying this game its high quality cultivated crack

if you dont have a job and you have a lot of free time and youre bored out of your mind and you need something to fill it this game will deliver im disabled so i dont have a job so i have a lot of free time and this game is eating all my free time i cant stop playing it its too fun to play too addictive its worth the pricing and downloading the english patch translation from the workshop or you can wait till 100 and itll be fully english then

hard on rimworld is this games default easy difficulty as you progress in fame the difficulty will scale up quickly and snowball

i highly recommend going on the community discord thats where the english players like to hang out also this game will kick your ass without a guide even when they fully translate this game it will still kick your ass so i highly recommend seeking help if you do plan to play

are some helpful links

a quality game that i hope will generate more ceebs weebs for chinese stuff  3

reasons i love this game 

 it wonderfully converts chinese taoist buddhist and wuxing philosophy traditional chinese medicine concepts and xianxia tropes into game mechanics chinese fantasy is a super fun genre
 the five elements wuxing really come into play in the game in a number of ways with almost every item in the game being assigned or needing to be created with a certain element
 youre forced to learn feng shui and practice it to a decent degree in your decorating lest your disciples become depressed and drop dead of heart attacks it is however a good technique to maim people and place them in an ominous bad feng shui room to die so you can harvest agonised soul shards from them
 the animism is so hardcore i had a random piece of iron ore on the edge of my map develop sentience trees gather and glow with qi lifeforce and the environment as a whole can be affected by qi flow turning different things into humans gives different hairstyles
 you can have an adorable spiritual dog who can defecate in any number of contexts and places you desire
 there are a variety of exciting character backstories and traits that can really make you invested in them
 characters have popups that make them feel real  eg someone could be cooking and begin to cry lol mood they can have unique conversations with each other at lunch mine like talking about their scars they can fall in love and it can be onesided or requited my ugly yaoguai manual labour slaves are being friendzoned by my ladies til the end of time xoxo they can get into arguments and have such dramatic falling outs with their roommates you have to do a switcheroo etc
 they also have moodlets similar to sims and are affected by their lifestyle and whats happening around them they have reactions to the type of food they eat the weather and season they can also have relationships with each other and this mechanic is even better with the tie the knot mod the most popular english language mod for the game as you can have siblings cousins parents crushes admirers lovers husbands and wives and harem members lol and have mary sue children
 character deaths feel immersive as you can build graves and tombs for them and other characters are impacted by their deaths gaining moodlets and providing reactions i was really surprised when my first tomb automatically labelled itself with the name of my deceased character and her friends gathered around her to offer prayers the game then told me to check the epilogue section in the main menu and when i clicked into it it generated a story for me of my characters future experience through the reincarnation cycle and all the different creatures and people she became just super neat
 you can play as awakened animals known as yaoguai with the type of animal they are affecting their stats and personality cats for example are as prissy as real life cats and refuse to do any manual labour can you tell im a dog person they do however excel in detail work due to their sharp and judgmental eye and can be very charming
 there are dragons and demon beasts but dragons
 base building is extremely satisfying and feels fun too due to the characters reactions to work having to keep their moods up and even the animations i love seeing them hauling two water buckets on sticks and chopping wood at the timber station for example as well as the appealing decorating options that fully take advantage of the beauty of the mythological ancient chinese setting
 there are seasons and different types of weather  also your characters can carry around umbrellas when it rains cute
 pretty special effects for cultivators and certain weapons
 complex health and medical system where every main part of the body flesh bones and organs can come into play and can be affected in certain ways characters can lose limbs experience internal damage have their skulls crushed acquire scars suffer heatstroke and frostbite etc you can craft acupuncture needles and medicines injuries can affect pain and therefore mood senses perception movement and ability to carry out skills i loved the fact that in kenshi different body parts could be affected this game takes it a step further
 this game isnt a farming sim but as someone who loves farming mechanics i found a fair bit to enjoy here the environment is affected by temperature and certain plants have specific requirements and you can make your own temperaturecontrolled greenhouses plants take a certain amount of time to grow and can be affected by their surrounding environment fertilisation but these are ancient times so by fertiliser i mean it the old school way  poop and dead bodies and your characters farming skill you can tame and passively breed animals and no its not too complex but every time mine die i experience physical pain in my chest so you can also use a variety of ingredients to cook many different recipes ive managed 50 different ones so far and am working on improving my ingredients so i can serve my characters top quality meals
 you can persuade others to join your sect recruit them through different events and constructing city recruitment agencies and even invite people to stay over to boost your relations essentially providing a hotelstyle minigame where you have to set up ideal accommodations to ensure your guests are fully satisfied
 the survival aspects are intense and fun there are also a number of different types of maps you can choose from for where your sect will be based
 you can reanimate corpses into undead puppets to do your dirty work
 you get a choice in how to react to certain scenarios  help that fellow who lost his way or kill him to get that shiny sword he has on his back gain resources from other sects through diplomacy and exchanging information they want in exchange for their intel or steal from them and wipe them out
 your adventures are not limited to your home bases map your cultivators can travel all over to socialise with other sects explore and gather resources you can set up your own temples
 you can pursue immortality while facing tribulations from the heavens for your defiance of the natural order of life and death
 you can become a god who receives tons of worshippers by your gate and can choose to accept and deny prayers
 you can practice a variety of schools of cultivation each with different focuses and effects
 you can develop obsessions which are basically glorified mental illnesses #representation
 the art style is really cute offering a little bit extra than pixel games while still not exceeding itself so i can even manage it on my junk laptop thats been dropped on its head a few times too many its modern but modest and just works perfectly balancing aesthetics and practicality

#####

i had to uninstall this game for while i was literally becoming a sheltered former version of myself that constantly wanted to cultivate

#####

i honestly find it hard to understand how this game can have anything less than overwhelmingly positive reviews i have read some of the negative reviews and they are honestly hilarious this game does not try to trick you into it with an expectation that you are going to play rimworld or any other of those colony management sims those parts of the game are there and you do build a base and make clothes and grow grain but after a while you can just kind of set it and forget it with over 2k food sitting in my freezer im honestly not even sure what is in there and i couldnt care less the problem seems that people walk into this expecting to try and survive or something like rimworld because that game is harsh and tries to kill you this game is about creating a dominating sect and focusing on your inner disciples and creating a flourishing powerhouse and of course this is all based on fengshui so if you have no interest in that you will fail at this game building a kitchen that is inauspicious will cause it to catch fire constantly people can and will die from your poor town design choices so you gotta figure out the system and work with it

but this game really stands on its own as amazing simulation game of any of the chinese cultivation novelsmanhua you may have read and if you are into that stuff this game will almost certainly be 100x more fun for you if you read the reviews you will see all these stories people have about their sect and this is 100 what makes this game awesome personally i have no idea what i am doing what half this magical elixers relics medicines and other such things even do however that doesnt stop me from trying to collect

i sent one of my practioners off to some mount doom adventure thing that popped up and he brought me back some fire lotus or something didnt realize my reward drop off point would be an issue till the thing heated up the surroundings to 200c and lit a building on fire some how one of my people managed to carry it to a pedestal i put in my ice crystal mine so i could stop getting notifications about fires but this thing also came in handy later when i built my water cultivation room i had an aritifact in there i won off some gambler where all i had to bet was 150 years of my lifespan problem was it cooled the room to a chilly 200c and my practitioner nearly died of frostbite trying to breakthrough put that other fire gem in the corner  voila only 70c in that room now even if it is a little angry about negative elements

right now im working on training up my pet dog to become a qi powerhouse it different from the sentient bamboo screen that wandered into my sect to eat rocks also different from all the chickens that joined my sect in the middle of winter and died of frostbite before they could even get to my pasture where they would have died anyways also different from my other project the tiger i bought off a wandering merchant who had awakened to the intelligence of anxiety i send him around to eat feces sniff trees and stare at people while they work in order to deepen his understanding of anxiety 

i honestly feel like i havent even scratched the surface of what this game has to offer and i know that by looking at some of this crazy other stuff there is that i should be working towards based on some guidebelow so for me its really hard to resist playing this game nonstop and i often look at the clock and thinkwhen did it become 5am i was only working on setting up another cultivation room to break another guy through to golden core maybe ill just play a little bit more

personal opinion

after spending 300 hours in this game learning all the guide tips etc the reward for creating the strongest sect is lackluster

each enemy sect have roughly the same power if you can defeat one of them you can defeat all
the reward isnt really useful since they are the toughest enemy in the game it like getting ultimate weapon after defeating final bossno reason to use those weapon at all 

each sect have a legendary formation but you wont have enough formation point to use them efficiently until you beat another 56 sects learn their unique formation and wonder
by the time you can use those formation you already halfway conquering the whole map  you dont need that formation at all to finish the rest if you using shendou or physical cultivator that formation reward is completely useless

for all the complicated mechanic they put in this game i dont understand why they didnt expand on the end game
all these time spent to learn so all the game mechanic and those end game fight just take less than 10min and it is nothing epic no dialogue no story


the main story is just tedious to do instead of normal dialogue now you have to talk with thousand of people to unlock their heart and then they give you tiny piece of the mystery i never gone past 5 peoples before i get bored 

if i can travel back to past i would tell past self that this game just not worth the time and effort to learn the learning curve is really steep for no good reason

#####

1010  with time invested
010  if you dont  invest time learning it

i love this game always end up coming back to it this game is like rimworld but with xiansia and eastern magics
it has very limiting tutorial that will not explain almost any real part of the game however it does feature comment sections on most items where otherr players may comment

#####

speaking of talismans we have to bring up skydome palaces elder he zudao

#####

fun  game when you actually understand what you should be doing recommend watching ic0n gaming yt channel very helpful

#####

by the time you start to understand beginner stuff about the game you will reach at least golden core level irl

#####

if you hate yourself play this till you hate yourself more

#####

probably my favourite game this year basically it is dwarf fortressrimworld with a chinese fantasy theme and more of a focus on minmaxing your characters than survival its also basically a crash course on daoist esotericism which is incredibly interesting to learn about from a western perspective as we are not typically exposed to it 

the game does have a steep learning curve though especially with the terms and themes which may be new to a player from the west getting through this curve is incredibly worth it though as the game is very deep and there is a ton to do and explore there are some amazing guides online which help immensely especially ic0n gamings tutorial series on youtube there is also an active modding community which has some mods that are almost a prerequisite install before playing

the game is not perfect of course the translation is not the best there are bugs and glitches and a some of the game systems especially the social system can be frustrating or even downright confusing at first but if you can overlook these negatives you are presented with a unique sandbox gaming experience that is rewarding to play for hours

now go eat your lingzhi cultivate your qi and become a god

#####

once i was an inner disciple trying to master the golden core state to its highest potential 
now i am a primordial master ushering in dozens to their greatest potential 
the road is hard and the path of reincarnation winding 
i am both filled with hope and filled with dread a harmonious balance 

play this game

edit i still implore you to play this game even though ive sunk so much time by now i am still learning new ways to advance further 

how was i meant to know that wood is the superior element for tools and bows 
how was i meant to know that every type of cultivator has a purpose no matter how trivial 
how was i meant to know that the walls beget the decorations which beget the fengshui objects
how was i meant to know that shendao cultivators can harvest obsessions

how little i once knew how much there is to know

#####

become a chinese monk loose pp ask a fellow friend to restore pp gift him my first pp as an powerful artifact have new pp

thanks sseth

#####

#####

for the love of god dont buy this game within 1 day after buying it i already put in 21 hours its fun to play but now i cant stop send help

#####

i build a room
i meditate inside
cultivation boom
heavens defied


#####

this game is like minesweeper it sits in the corner while you acknowledge its existence youre terrified to play it it eludes you in a strange mystical way then you actually meet someone that can play it and youre pretty sure theyre an alien then you convince yourself you can be an alien too  this is my least embarrassing way of admitting that im stuck on sentence two 

i know this is a good game im getting there i love the fact this game eludes me out of the hundreds i have i will get to decoding it one day dont ever dumb or water it down for folks like me games will always be better being mystical i deserve to have this game gnawing at the back of my head 

#####

this is a very interesting game quite confusing and complex the premise is that you build and groom your cultivatorsin different laws these are qi paths all which are equivalent to magical powers that you give to your characters there are two types of characters inner disciples and outer disciples outer disciples are common humans or yao guay humanoid beasts with different skills which help sustain your little colony by hunting farming mining etc inner disciples are superhumans are incredibly strong in battle and have magical qi powers while the game at first may seem similar to rimworld or df it is much more than a mere colony sim everything in the world is affected by feng shui and the 5 elements and their interactions so orinetation  and materials must always be taken into consideration once there is a specific breakthrough and you get your very own mini universe to store almost everything the way the colony works changes drastically and becomes much more focused on the inner disciples and their cultivation paths i have played for over 200 hours and am by no means an expert this game is very complex and there are times when youll seem to be doing fine and realize you did a lot of things wrong and now your inners are very weak compared to those from de ai so theyll wipe the floor with your entrails it is advised that you get a hold of several wikis and guides to more or less monitor what youre doing many things arent self explanatory and making mistakes will cost you as a side note always check your sects reputation and try to keep it as low as possible once it grows  invaders will become stronger and stronger and you might not be able to handle them graphicwise the game looks cartoony and is pleasant the music is beautiful and the gameplay is all about grinding so youll spend a lot of time watching numbers grow i do recommend the game but be prepared to learn its mechanics the learning curve is quite steep

do not be mislead with comparisons to rimworld or dwarf fortress this is only a superficial similarity there is a building and management aspect to it but it quickly takes a backseat once youre done with the early game and have your bearings

what this game is really about is making the most obscenely ridiculously powerful goku you can its about squeezing every last bit of qi juice from every piece of rock to raise the strongest and most terrifying monster in many ways its like an incremental game where every time you break a points ceiling some new mechanic is revealed to make your number go up even more its minmaxing the game and if thats something you like buddy youre in for a ride

you have your daoist gokus that can reshape the map with magic become immortal with alchemy forge powerful artifacts and gather resources to lay foundation for raising the next generation of even stronger smarter and faster gokus

you have your physical gokus that can mutate their flesh and bone into inhuman abominations regrow lost limbs and reach enlightenment through punching things really hard

you have your godly gokus feeding off belief and worship amassing thousands of followers and building a palace in heaven

you can turn a literal piece of crap that your magical doggo made into a goku if you have the right skills hell you can make a door or a frog into a goku the possibilities are endless


cons yeah it is a bit janky ui can get a bit used to graphics are rpg maker assets tier the base management side of the game is actually the weakest with some annoying and fiddly things that could just as well have been automated

#####

ive put 80 hours in this game and the only achievement i have is its time to sleep not cultivate
i went through the florida education system and i did that with less effort than i am affording to this freaking feng shui simulator 
apparently other people who play this game actually know what the hell is happening and that fn befuddles me majorly
looking forward to game 2

#####

after playing for around 500hrs and countless time on forums and youtube i have kinda got the grips of the finer points of the game i really enjoyed playing this game and still have an iron man run going slowly over time for achievements

if you like colony games management games or just interested in qi cultivation and what eastern influences do with yaogaoi i highly recommend this game but be patience because it not like usual games and once you get your head around qi and the differences between the 3 cultivation styles you will love it

#####

wake up cultivate eat cultivate drink cultivate friends are temporary cultivation is forever family is a roadblock to true cultivation abandon reality and cultivate my jade like beauties

#####

if you like wuxiaxianxia novels and rimworld style games this is the game for you huge amount of content and many different systems to play around with

#####

i hate myself

#####

one evening i started this game the next morning i saw this achievement

time to sleep not cultivate
the game has been running for over 4 hours and the current time is between 000500 am

it was worth it

#####

amazing highly recommended i was on the fence about buying but am so glad i did if youre still on the fence here are some thoughts to help

list
 although there is a learning curve it is still quite fun as you are learning
 while you are learning you wont thrive but you wont just die and get frustrated
 the tutorial is extensive and very good
 it shares some similarities with rimworld so if you have experience there it will help get started 
 the similarities with rimworld are only on the surface i find acs to be vastly more interesting beautiful exotic exciting  list

if you do decide to play here are some thoughts on getting started
list
 the tutorial is a good place to start but it may take more than 2 hours to do all the tutorials if you have any thoughts about refunding be mindful of that time i suggest doing about half the tutorials then just jump in and start a game
 find one of the getting started guides just to help with character selection and perk selection you cant quite just accept all defaults without making choices so this is where the learning curve is not fun ie before you can even get started list

one last thought the guides available on steam and on discord help some but i think many of them are out of date try to think of the guides as just a quick pointer in the right direction not as something to really clarify how things work discovery is more fun than reading about it

#####

i read a book  my wang fell off  i enchated it is a flying wepon  then fed it a potion and it became a person 1010

#####

if you invest time and effort in learningits a very interesting game that combines the elements of cultivation and simulation management players can experience the fun of becoming a master of cultivation in the game with diverse gameplay and storylines players can improve their cultivation skills by planting medicinal herbs refining pills practicing martial arts and other activities while also recruiting disciples defeating enemies exploring secret realms and more

overall this game has high entertainment value and playability allowing players to experience the wonderful world of cultivation as the game progresses new content and challenges are constantly unlocked if youre a fan of cultivation or simulation management games then it is definitely a game you wont want to miss

#####

pretty amazing game all in all 

the game itself is a micromanagement game similar to rimworld but with xianxia instead of scifi it takes a while to figure everything out and youre likely to experience disasters for your first couple of games after that though the game opens up therere so many systems in the game that even after 200 hours im still discovering new things i didnt know existed the battles are fun to watch but require enough input and attention that they dont feel boring even when they last for an extended period the feng shui mechanics of the game make for a slightly more engaging basebuilding element than otherwise and make for interesting puzzles when designing aesthetically pleasing bases 

as you accumulate experience the game tends to open up especially towards the start and has multiple game modes oriented towards returning players achievements are actually disabled for the beginner modes and only enabled in the immortal mode in which only a single save is allowed which is overwritten whenever you exit the game immortal mode has a number of modifiers and special rules that can be toggled to make the game more difficult or to add new challenges when the game says that the mode isnt for beginners it isnt kidding many of the modifiers multiply the difficulty of the game by many times with several that are infamous in the games community for being wipe points even for fairly experienced players 

the games ingame mod interface and mod store work fairly well and have relatively powerful creation tools the game also comes with builtin documentation and can be fairly easily edited to make minor changes to parameters in the game

all that said there are downsides to the game that somewhat take away from the experience the help menu is hard to find and the games wiki tends towards unhelpful this is somewhat offset by the helpful and friendly community on discord but isnt a good substitute the translation of the game is barely meh by standards of chinese to english games and therere certain things that have different translation depending on where you look anyone who reads a fair amount of xianxia is likely to be thrown off by the nonstandard translations of major realms that only roughly match up and the story is honestly little better than gibberish furthermore its more common than not for text to simply be unreadable because it runs out of the space it has allocated finally the game is incredibly slowlypaced certain important events are completely unavailable until day 300 which can easily equal 3040 hours of gametime in a single save

all in all i heartily recommend the game the minute annoyances of the problems with the game are very much outweighed by the gameplay itself whenever issues came up i quickly tended to forget about them amidst all the other things i needed to do to keep everything running smoothly im on my seventh sect now and i still havent run out of things to do 

overall 810
translation 310
gameplay 910
length of play 1010
replayability 1010
story 510

i turned my pet rabbits into anime girls i turned my pet tigers into anime girlsi turned my enchanted swords into anime girls i turned pieces of my bedroom walls into anime girls i even found a way to turn my own sht into anime girls and then i found away to turn myself into a girl and then turn my severed cck into an anime girl not many games allow you to harness the power feng shui in this way but i am glad thank you china for showcasing why anime girls are so powerful and teaching me a new way to make this world more depraved

speaking of talismans we have to bring up skydome palaces elder he zudao
 
an absolute masterpiece of a game 

tldr
puddles is just a misunderstood dragon who wants to sleep close to you
psl is best xiandao law prove me wrong hnl i dare you
body cultivators are literally one punchman
if i have to do another mental breakthrough for shendao i swear to god

shout out to all the lads in the discord would recommend joining if anyone is struggling we have guides and a fantastic helpers chat which issues fairly quick responses dont mind grumpy iggy though he means well and loves us all

#####

on my first playthrough a feather fell from sky on day 150 oh look its a phoenix feather i should put this in to my storage where my food are stored which connects to dormitories where 10 people are currently  asleep after a long days of work  the whole fcking block started burning down while my outers btching that its scorching hot but then they started shitting everywhere while carrying water to fire which i thought was odd until i noticed my god damn dog was feeding laxatives to everyone after everything was over 2 refrugess arrived at x10 speed which then my god damn dog again murdered them infront of a rock like a sacrifice i dont like them either but that was too much still that was the most fun ive had with a game in a long time i definetly recommend it

#####

i love this game if you enjoy eastern fantasy or xianxia novels mixed with rimworld you will most likely also love this game also with the fact that the english version is now available for public testing you dont even have to download the mod anymore to do so just go to the public discord and go to the english test channel ive also been told that after the 10 release the price for the game will go up so nows a perfect time to get it if you like these type of games

#####

so good and addicting my latest game got mildly corrupted near the 150 hour mark but i was actually kind of glad because i never would have been able to stop on my own i do have old saves i could go back to but im going to consider that a divine mercy kill so that i can take a break and start a new game once the next dlc comes out

#####

make your own xianxia drama series characters and watch them die to an enraged demon turtle that gained sentience wandering around in the sects backyard pond then watch as a sentient statue that randomly decided to make your sect home wanders over and eats the corpse
cry after your new golden core character gets killed because you werent monitoring their activities when they were visiting the neighbours pissed them off and they dismembered them and sent them back in pieces
they say pain is growth well then expect to grow a lot playing this gamed d d
i still love it

#####

finally living the life of a cultivator in a wuxia novel though my actions are more antihero than hero

one of the many interesting things you can do in this game is that you can force feed practically anything organic to anyone and most items be they pills or other items have different yet funny effects 

did someone get greedy and attack your sect you managed to knock them out do you want to really screw with him instead of killing them why dont you force feed them a rebirth pill it will turn them into a mortal causing them to lose their entire cultivation skill set and max age limit not enough to relent your anger feed them a pill that makes them obese then another pill that makes them ravenously hungry them let them wander off on their own what happens to their new life is no longer your concern 

do you want to be a real antihero go adventure out into the wild and chances are you will meet other cultivators from other sects who adventured out to gain experience some of these cultivators can be innerdisciples elders or even sect leaders repeat the steps above and hehehehehe

whenever i personally feel particularly vengeful after being raided while minding my own business i would feed these people excrement

yes excrement that are left all over the map 

the result would either kill these raiders outright or they would eventually get up and just wander off the map being forced to eat shit can apparently even break the mind and spirit of an immortal cultivator who needs torture when you have such prominent tools lying around 

ps i am probably the only player cultivator walking around with excrements in my pocketsinventory

pss if your own units eat shit they will get a near permanent moodlet debuff guess its this moodlet debuff that i give to my enemies d

psss it is only a matter of time before the entire cultivator world unites to erase my sect from existence


#####

if you like wuxiaworld novels you will love this game

#####

do not buy this game
ive torn down my entire apartment block because room orientation was messing up my apartments feng shui and am rebuilding it out of jade i dug out of the ground
my freezer is filled to the brim with feces
i get panic attacks when i see wooden furniture inside brick houses
one time i nearly started a forest fire to make a rock feel better

it will take over your life you have been warned

#####

what is even happening

#####

writing this review right after completing the main storyline without spoiling anything i can only say that i spent lots of time doing trial  error first time should be in the easiest difficulty until you start figuring out how the game works for the first 5070 hours it has a huge learning curve including but not limited to keeping a low profile resource management feng shui individual character needs including keeping them happy no matter the playthrough the first few characters you make will suck so dont get too attached to them then once you gather your bearing and only if you care about steam achievements start an immortal difficulty playthrough achievements only unlock if you are playing in this difficulty only one exception

now about the story spoiler free you have to a chat minigame in order to unlock some mysteries depending on how much information you managed to unlock the final ending dialogues will be different also you reach different conclusions depending on how many and which mysteries you unlocked 4 different versions

tldr the game is a huge time sink not for everyone some people will love it some will hate it

#####

感觉制作组要么就是惹了人要么就是狂热玩家惹到人这在我眼中不是那种粗制滥造的拙劣模仿品然后随便拿出卖钱的里面有加入了很多东西和理解人物养成方面要比rimworld多一点细节谁买这游戏库存还没个rimworld敢问那些上来狂喷的确定版本初期rimworld的质量就硬的不行同样的模仿品星露谷怎么就没见到那么多正义使者在那里叫唤

#####

this is the only game where i will willingly do math which goes to show how addictive acs is

#####

this game is objectively bad confusing laggy poorly translated buggy annoying but i love it
somethings wrong with me

#####

i dont know what im doing but still like it

#####

i dont know whether i just dont understand game mechanics or if my house has bad feng shui

#####

hey hey people doc here

i purchased this game 6 days ago and it has completely taken over my life
my first sect went quite well or so i thought my first cultivator has a max qi of 1867 by the time he was ready to form a golden core and he got a tier eight golden core somehow a few days later my sect got attacked by band of cosplaying furries who were taking large quantities of steroids and everyone got trampled to death via their super powered bovine hooves

in my current run the game gave me female cat yaoguai who i was going to originally gonna give the xiandao sunflower refining law but whilst mining i found an ancient casket that contained one of the shendao laws so i decided to do the only logical course of action and turn the cat woman into a deity meanwhile my main cultivatorsect leader is casually flying around the world in search of ginseng and large quantities of wood

my one complaint is that i need a mod to have multiple pets at once please gsq in acs2 let me have the dog and the fox at the same time

i rate this game 1010
i have already spent 77 hours in the game and that number will continue to increase until i reach the thousands

#####

must buy if you are into chinese wuxia


#####

so you like chinese wuxia plus you are into rimworld oh goodness then you just found the best time killer out there

9 out of 10 for wuixa systems
7 out of 10 for base simulation

gameplay a solid 6 and difficulty level and qi understanding helpful

sadly too many events rely on text for solutions but maybe there is more in the expansions otherwise fun in the 1st 100 hours and ready for the next 40

great flexibility in map choice and game speed  characters have a huge range of choice in what the become once awakened even if they just stop doing base work

#####

i have spent many hours many sleepless nights many thoughts pondering on the wonders of eastern medicinal theory just to play this game to a level above pure noobery

#####

not carrying feces to snack on while adventuring in wyvern pool very unwise

#####

the only thing i know is that i know nothing

#####

a physical cultivator came to my sect and ripped apart 3 of my outer disciples with his bare hands 1010

#####

i was on a rimworld kick and stumbled on thisa game that at first glance is much easier from a survival perspective but hides systems on systems on systems of depth  currently the best guides to be found are in the scattered google docs and help channel in their official discord  a lot of the concepts are unintuitive and require a combination of guides and trying and failing in order to understand properly  so while i had to spend a lot of time reading docs and starting over i can officially say im having a lot of fun now  like a sci fi or fantasy novel that doesnt explain or give you anything for 3 or 400 pages then suddenly comes together

#####

this is a game that

list
 had stolen my sleep and occupied every corner of my mind for three weeks when i tried it for the first time
 i proceed to return to every once in a while like a month every season or so
 the mechanical depth is such that even after 500 hours im feeling like im not even halfway to the bottom 
list

not saying that it will be the same for you dear reader as chinese fantasy setting isnt everyones thing but in case youre open minded about it as well as the indie feel of it then at the very least you wont be totally disappointed 

ps dont start with yaoguais unless they have 200 days to shapeshifting

#####

acs is a strange game as of this review ive played for almost 100 hours and i feel like i could whittle away a few hundred more before being finished ill probably never finish it but ive played it ienoughi ive ascended cultivators to immortality ive struggled with immortal mode and even tussled with the flood dragon

the problem is how those 100 hours are spent the majority of your time playing this game will be micromanagement youll move from micromanaging your outer disciples to micromanaging your inner ones then micromanaging your outposts then micromanaging your relationships with other sects and so on and so on when you dont micromanage you wait wait for the next cultivation breakthrough wait for the buildings to be built wait for your adventurers to return and so on and so on this is made worse by ingame deadlines your pet will always appear at day 30 and the 25th clue only appears on day 565 for instance you may very well jolt awake five hours into an acs session to discover that youve missed a onetimeonly event and that you can no longer 100 the story time is your greatest resource in this game but you need to spend it like a billionaire shilling out for his fifth yacht 

and yet even after all that the game is strangely beautiful i find myself getting drawn in back again and again theres an elegance to the mechanics and the method theres a sense of intrigue behind every unexplained game mechanic and every unsolved mystery and of course 100 hours gives you a connection to your randomized little cast of characters that you just dont get in other games i cried when my very first character ascended to immortality and left behind my sect forever its these feelings this sense of depth and satisfaction that makes the game worth playing

if you arent prepared to dig your teeth into this game and its world then dont pick it up its that simple but if you want a game thatll last something that can keep you on your toes even after hundreds of hours it is very worth it

#####

youre gonna need a guide for this game but if youre willing to do a little bit of reading its a wierd fun simulator where youre basically running a chinese cult in search of immortality  some of the translations are laughably bad but it makes it more fun that way imo

#####

look as someone who has 200 hours of fucking around in rimworld i really really find this to be incredibly fun lol are there similarities between the two games yes are there shit tons of differences yes the basic mechanics are the same but the deeper part such as the cultivation and fighting part its pretty unbelievable i am looking forward for the developers to add more stuff in for now its a 710 especially if you are a rimworld fan 

disclaimer pretty sure you need to understand some basic chinese to actually play this game lel

#####

congo warlord approved
hey hey people why does everyone make terrible comparisons between games i fail to understand how this game is like rimworld the two games are almost completely alien to each other if you told me this was chinese dwarf fortress but with better graphics and a more user friendly ui id be inclined to agree

also i still have no idea what the actual hell im doing

#####

great game to play while reading wuxia novels

#####

must try if you like wuxia novel

#####

personally being a fan of cultivation novels i really love this game its amazinging indepth and thoughtful in how it takes such a complex and diverse fantasy genre and turns these into mechanics its actually more so than many novels which tend to be simplified 

while playing you can have all sorts of interesting things happen such as suddenly the wheat you were growing attains sentienceenlightenment this happened to me and then my outer disciples accidentally reaped it rip

random events happen such as a fei appearing in the sect land causing rain and illness which doesnt go away until you slay the beast upon doing so you get to take the rare beast blood and fei hide 

i think that some things can be a bit complicated for people who are not familiar with the cultivation genre but not so much so that you cant even play you can muddle through pretty well without your entire sect being on the constant verge of being wiped out just guides can be helpful so you dont reach stuck points later on 

one of my absolute favorite features is the mystery investigation there is this awesome social screen where you can talk to people and find out their likesdislikes and any secrets they know i love being able to build up relationships with random npcs bribe them etc they have different personality types so they arent all going to react well to the same thing ex upright people will hate you if you try to bribe them but greedy people will spill everything they know

i also really like the cute art for the achievements its funny and quite enjoyable 

overall i highly recommend the game especially to either fans of cultivation novels or people who like indepth simulators like dwarf fortress this is similar to dwarf fortress but as a bonus you can actually enter specific areas with direct control of your inner disciples in order to talk to people and take more direct action so its less monotonous

#####

autism

#####

amazing takes time to get really good at game im still learning even with my 900 plus hours

#####

i had my physical cultivator remodel his penis to be bigger in order to improve his mood simply 1010

#####

rimworld  wuxia novels 

#####

i read cultivation manga

#####

scratches a similar itch to dwarf fortress totally addictive but you can pause and walk away as needed


#####

this is the perfect strategyrpgcultivator game if you have played disgaea you know what i am talking about its one of the games you can be playing all your life minmaxing trying different builds and different paths it has a lot of systemsmechanics in it so if you are fan of that kind of stuff you will get addicted to it

#####

amazing cultivation simulator is a fantastic game in the same vein as oxygen not included rimworld prison architect and other games that focus on building a base raising your people and customizing it to look how you want it to look that being said it is absolutely chalk full of nuance when it comes to how you much do things in order to achieve your goals and as such can really only be enjoyed fully after reading some guides to explain how things work but once you understand what is going on and can really dig into the game youll find hours of your time sucked away it is a shockingly deep game with many features to play around with if it suites your fancy there is an entire storyline hidden in the background of the game that requires finesse ingenuity and patience to get through or you know a guide that explains exactly what you need to do to solve it

all in all i highly recommend this game to anyone who has the patience to really sit down watch the tutorials read the guides and enjoy everything that it has to offer

#####

forgot to leave a review so here is one

#####

loved this game until i found out that theres a glitch that blocks any and all story progression based on rng major npcs with clues can die randomly before you even have a chance to meet them and not only do the devs know this glitch exists but they seem completely uninterested in fixing it i shouldnt need to download a mod to resurrect an important npc that the game decided would only live until day 30 why the hell are you making a second game if the first one still has game breaking issues that completely wall the player off from any further story progression

#####

a fun game where minmaxing and understanding its game mechanics makes you feel like you still dont know what youre doing

#####

this game is literally amazing you start out with feeling like dwarf fortress while you build your temple but once you break into cultivation the game becomes its own thing its feng shui mechanic and sect laws makes things so interesting to work with and will keep you busy for hours if you like colony sims and youre looking for something different in the genre then this is the game for you

#####

just have fun with it and dont take it too seriously for your first play through

ive played 12 hours so far and still have very little clue of what im doing and somehow im still having fun 
i know there are online guides out there but im avoiding looking at them because i think it takes the fun out of things

 i do  recommend at the bare minimum to look at the in game tutorials or else youll literally get nowhere 

on my second try ill probably take a look at some guides because ive noticed you hit a bit of a wall when it comes to progressing further than the general colony stage which is really only the first part of the game

#####

very easy to obsess over so much information to absorb that when im not actively playing im studying or watching videos about it recommend youtube ic0n gaming at 2x speed
i am afraid im too far gone its in my dreams now
my partner and i are spending all our free time cultivating now no life nor practising procreation anymore but no regrets this is better
tldr 100 recommend

#####

this is rimworld had a baby with wuxia novels

it does play like rimworld but with an added rpglike grind in it

overall i like it

#####

its taken over my adhd riddled brain and i cant put it down rimworld wasnt scratching the itch for me anymore after 1000 hours and then i decided to try this again its like quitting alcohol for heroin im stuck on it now and cant stop 

if you love watching numbers go up and 63 year old grandmas using ancient feces as a weapon of mass destruction i highly suggest it

#####

cultivation rim world

#####

cultivated a powerful turtle into a wise powerful fighter and talisman maker before failing a tribulation and watching the now transformed sect leader slaughter everyone as a mindless demonic turtle had fun woe is genius saber wielder that fell after delivering far greater injury than his cultivation would ever suggest

#####

if youre the type of person where numbers going up makes your dopamine production increase check this game out similar to rimworld mixed with chinese xianxia style fiction seeing your little dudes slowly get stronger and stronger until they become gods is very satisfying

#####

the games good probably one of the best wuxia games ive played but its ridiculous how much important information is just unavailable ingame i had no idea what to do with fengshui until i experimented for a few hours and found a helpful guide online 

i couldnt get past golden core and get to the real game for hours even when i cheated just to see the midlate game stuff i understand that im not meant to have the best cultivator out the gate but i dont have the time to read through hundreds of pages of online guides learn all of the intricate mechanics of the game and create several weaker characters till my sect is able to reliably make strong golden cores

the gist of what im trying to get at is that the game requires a lot of grinding and isnt really rewarding in the end so if you have time and like wuxia then i recommend it otherwise i think its way too complicate to get into

#####

i made an artifact out of bear hide thin pants called grim clothes 
basically i have a pair of pants that flies around killing enemies from across the map 


thats fucking awesome


#####

even without an official translation the english community is more than helpful however when this game gets a full translations bet your as s that it will draw in even more people its like rimworld with a higher focus on individual character development around combat the building management is just a small section in comparison in my opinion and sometimes the fan translation makes for some weirdfunny translation issues literal translations are pretty funny and i cannot count how many times ive had female characters die from penis mutilation caused by turtles

#####

game restricts you heavily from being able to do creative things mechanically wise you cant really automate a procedure of things together you always have to manually interact with a start to make an end to most mechanics of the game

#####

this arrogant young master has no idea what they are doing

as it should be

#####

one of the most confusing and complex management games ever loved figuring out what the heck is going on for 50 hours and then only sort of figuring it out while tackling ever greater challenges and failing at them

1010 would turn the penis that fell off my cultivator into a spiritual weapon for killing giant evil chickens again

#####

woah i know feng shui

#####

4 hours just for the tutorial  this is a game with some serious meat on it  and it looks amazing  honestly the art is what caught my attention the vague references to my all time favorite game rimworld got me wondering just from the tutorial i can already tell there is truely  no semblance to rimworld other than the top down view and so i took the plunge and bought the game
there is obviously alot of culture and fan clubbing be drawn upon by all the reviews you can read  i wont claim to be in the know about all that and how it reflects on any of it  but i can say from a newbs perspective its 1 pretty to look at 2 its got a seriously deep learning curve and 3 i might just have found my next 2000 hr game 

#####

this game is good so good that 3 hours in you find yourself trapped within the recesses of google docs explaining why it is optimal to have a bed made of iron and why it is essential to amputate ones penis before the golden core breakthrough

the study materials for this game alone can cover at least a semester of a college major instead of giving a proper review let me tell you some tips on how you can get a tier 1 golden core from your 1st or maybe second generation of core disciples

cultivator should have at base no cultivation around 40 qi sense

eat 2 earth flux 1 purple junk pill i always do my first generations without wicked flux because its unnecessary

i personally do around 6 of each red ginseng and ganoderma

on the day of breakthrough season should be really good 3

on the day of breakthrough have a talisman of good mental bonus around 10 will do take a purity pill to keep it pristine important

the location should have a qi gathering of at least 600 or so no need to overkill

always use the best weather keep it up all the way through

time the breakthrough so it ends in 5 yin yang just before 1 the 5 yinyang should be up majority of the time of breakthrough to the end its okay to save scum just to get the timing right

learn every manual giving max qi qi sense constitution and int dont bother learning the one which explodes your heart its unneeded

if you get everything right it should give anywhere between 130k150k base t1 cultivator which are fine for 1st generation if you mess up the mental andor timing it can go as low as t2 to be honest there is just a little incentive to go for t1 before for 1st generation since you mostly rebirth them once you have dedicated king maker alchemist and artificer but its something i just do because i kinda like being ocd about breakthroughs

#####

if youve played rimworld but liked the progression side more than the storytelling side then this game might just be for you

#####

ill come back when the english translation is release

#####

i actually originally refunded the game due to sheer frustration out of trying to understand how it worked

now having rebought it and many hours later i can safely say that its an amazing game if you get easily frustrated by obtuse mechanics and not knowing barely anything after spending an hour spent just playing the tutorial you probably wont like it that said if you can persevere its an incredibly fun timesink absolutely worth the price

#####

ive played for much longer before it was shilled on a pworded copy and i have to say i recommend this game the difficulty is understanding all of the hidden mechanics but once you achieve that you can take whatever aspect of the game that you understand and achieve total dominance when you understand feng shui your every building will be very auspicious when you understand the elemental relation to loot you can grab all of the spirit roots you want etc that isnt to say that this makes the game easy i still under estimated my reputation game and am now playing as a sect with 6000 reputation a reputation which attracts very hard enemies
i dont know if the game is worth your time because its very slow but i am still enjoying it immensely

#####

definitely recommend this game for long term strategist types in the realm of simulation games this is not the average simulator and it will likely take you more than one run to really get going this game is really engaging and there is a lot to it definitely worth the buy

#####

because of this game i actually plan on cultivating the power of the dao

#####

bottom line  it is an amazing game just like the title says  an indie title that shames bigger productions

but it is not without flaws  the mid to late game management lacks any form of automation functionality and gets rather burdensome trying to manage every aspect of every cultivator eventually  the secrets are so obtuse that i feel either something was severely lost in translation or they were never discoverable aside from trial and error which mandates more wiki use than i like for a game

#####

imma finish this game in 100hrs clueless

#####

love how this game is turning out hope it continues to get continues support from the devs

#####

i have 3 weeks of work accumulated thanks to this game

#####

china strikes back with their own version of the opium wars

#####

if there was a mixed review this game would get one but between recommend or not i cant recommend it

mostly because it really feels like its a chinese game with a english mod and not a english translation
the va in the tutorials are fine but my issue is with the translation it feels awkward at some parts and the font its really really bad since the ui is made for chinese chars the english really doesnt fit the screen and all the time feels like you are playing a game jam game

the content in the game its great not gonna lie and ill keep my eye on the game if it gets an update that addresses this issue but at the current state i was not enjoying myself while playing because it really felt just off 

other than the translation there are a bunch of other things that could use some patching 
 the 25 models dont fit the game background at all it feels like you are playing with weird poorly made assets from mods 
 the information on the game is really not balanced they over explain some parts and dont give information at all on others the game was really smooth in this first hour until one characters died out of nowhere with no information on why or the reason and if it was in some of the menus it was really unclear where and i have hundreds of hours on colony sims so i was paying close attention to their health 
 the priority system was really just a worse rimworldoxygen not includedany other sim implementation it was just one job for each person and do or dont and again if there were settings besides that it was really unclear 
 there is no feedback on interacting with the ui not transition animation it almost looks like an html game

the game just feels like an unpolished alpha of itself like they are making all the content nonstop using placeholder assets everywhere and if you can ignore that be my guest and try it out
i care about that stuff and i decided to stop playing for now and maybe with some time and active community these problems can be fixed

#####

im impressed frankly it has been years since i binged 80 hours in my first week and im barely scratching the surface of the game

edit second week in i can talk about it a bit more with good conscience

this game is ultimately about delayed gratification if you dont save up for the right time the right resources the right climate the right student the right technique you will stall eventually but on the other hand if you dont do the suboptimal thing you will die you have to juggle both expertly if you want to survive same thing for building things at the beginning you could go for the perfect room but it takes a lot of work or you could go for good enough and go much faster you have to balance the needs of the now versus the potential rewards later both are crucial if you dont level strong enough cultivators you will die but you need them both quickly and later and the need for both time are very different and conflict with each others this makes for some great juggling though sometimes a random event might feel frustrating i remember a physical cultivator mowing my 6 low level inner diciples in seconds once because i pissed some other sect too much or 3 combat event popping at the same time one giant magical serpent on a rampage in my peons while a bunch of mad nonmagical cows murdered my best farmer ironically a cow as well on the side while i was fighting 3 enemy cultivators with my main fighters so yeah sometimes you can get screwed the game will push back if you piss of the wrong people too soon

as for the fengshui aspect dont freak out too much it is quite simple once you get the hang of it after starting back a few times and following other players advice bubbles for rooms and stuff youll get through easy it does leave with some constrains though it might feel frustrating for some not to be able to make what you want visually or functionally but sometimes restrictions can breed creativity in ways you wouldnt have guessed before

im just sad the community is not bigger for this game i have a lot of fun and i could use a decent streamer on this sadly the ones on youtube are even more clueless than me

to note i barely had one gold core cultivator up to now im big on delaying gratification small on surviving due to pressing matters so i still have to learn a lot about this game it still has some deep ends i feel like im facing dwarf fortress all over again

#####

the only game where you can become godlike and poke your enemies to death with op enchanted flying dck

#####

i dont know what im doing but i already clocked 100 hours and im loving every minute of it

#####

all my current hours played dated back to when this game came out it wasnt this rich of contents but was already fun enough back then it was always on my watch list the updates seemed really amazing and now its back to my play list after few other games there are words that eng ver is already under testing maybe they plan to release that when this game is out of early access it would definitely be worth trying for every fan of cultivation

#####

cool game for people who like wuxia manhwa and lightnovels and stuff its the only real option in terms of games when it comes to wuxia

#####

i literally have restarted 15 times in the last day but damn if it is not better and better each time  i love how the items have an option for all players to leave notes thank you to anyone who mentioned the door positioning

#####

my weewee fell off 1010 immersion would become femboy again

#####

hey hey people im very confused and dont know what im doing im not sure why im playing this game but i guess there is something fun about cutting off the heads of people that disagree with ur beliefs using a literal piece of shit

#####

full english support in the works english mod exists currently with a lot of the game translated  very active discord community

#####

great if you have a huge amount of time to spend the game is almost nonsensically detailed and requires a lot of guide reading to not waste time the rimworldish part is only about 15 of the game the rest is all managing various resources manuals and adventures to power up your cultivators

#####

hidden gem great game wuxia novel readers will love it if youre new to the genre give it try you wont be disappointed

#####

i have several hundred hours in this game most of which are offline so they are not recorded by steam the only reason i bring this up is because i still only have one achievement for staying up late playing the game i cant stop

#####

chinese version of rimworld love it so many great random events make this game great

#####

xianxiastyle rimworld 

#####

if you like this go read cradle by will wight

#####

i have no hecking idea what im doing

#####

honestly what i would like is a cross between this and the sims more automation of others in the sect so i can focus more on a single character or familyclan within the sect i want to live out the main characters in the dozens of wuxia novels ive read rather than micromanage an entire sect of people but this is as close as ive been able to find to that and it is actually interesting in its own way its a fun game to play though it can be very confusing at first as you try to get a grasp of some of the core concepts i would recommend it mostly out of a lack of better options for similar game concepts but there is plenty of room for improvement and expansion

#####

when i play this game it makes me feel like my name is kevin or something

#####

this game saved my life

i am 27

my exwife and i have a daughter together and adopted our son together they are now both 4 years old

when we were going through our separation i found myself lost and miserable i was self destructive i got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that i punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion that caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand my working hand my games hand the hand that i held and carried my children to bed with the hand i desperately needed to make sure i could continue to provide

after learning of the severity of my selfinflicted damage i was borderline suicidal keep in mind that just a few months before this i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety i have never had fits of rage or been one to break down and cry but i was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side

having nothing better to do i searched for a game i could play one handed while i recovered i somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews i decided that it had to be worth a shot i must admit i didnt beat the game or play nearly as long as some of you in fact i may have only played this game a day or two with that being said after doing so i had a new found joy and hope for life i was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me i was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness i was able to see the fruits of my labor i relaxed for 5 ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that i was going to be okay

after coming to that realization i turned the game off and i went back to work it hurt my hand like hell but i was motivated i stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself and i became the father i needed to be in that moment not the weak boy i was behaving as

today i am close friend with my kids mother we dont fight or argue or say hurtful things to each other we are parents and friends

i now have 3 kids my third child is wait for it also 4 years old the woman i am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly we have been in a relationship for a year now and are very happy together

moral of the story you never know what life holds in store for you and if i would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me i wouldnt be where i am today this silly little game helped me realize that

thank you amazing cultivation simulator

#####

his game is a cultivation avid reader dream come true in which case i love xanxia which i read daily when i do not game sure this game might not have the best interface and controls which are clunky as some things can be made a bit easier sometimes the ai is a bit clunky and the translation with voiceover can be a bit wonky at times the game mechanics have so much depth that it blows me away as soon as you discover a new thing the mechanic goes in deeper and keeps you hooked you wont know what went wrong without a decent guide because the tutorial does not hold your hand at all just gives you the basics and there are 2 hours of it ive played 30 hours and barely touched 5 of the game
starts off playing a bit like rim world and thats as much rim as it gets because then all that changes as every cliche in every cultivation novel kicks in here just to name a few ive seen

youll discover oh you need to face door a certain direction kitchen to the west crafting to the east and rooms to south everything else can be north 

balance out the feng shui is important

 figure out how to cultivate fast things get harder youll get a pet which powers which you can train its mechanic system 

 the cultivation laws have their system your pp will fall off because you cultivate a yin ability but then youll have a chance to grow it back youll even discover laws with depth like body tampering body parts like rock lee from naruto even growing your pp into an artifact weapon and other parts of your body into super pieces each body part with like 10 different muscles and become ultraman just one of the many laws but wait theres even more laws that you can find later on depending on your race and if you arent human there are tribulations which can turn you into god knows what

 there are sect and quests in the world to discover evil sect of hermits a sect of good guys who rides swords hell theres a  female sect that sucks the qi energy from your body through sexual intercourse along with other evil or good sect out there you can be friends and negotiate with them or be a goodevil sect yourself to suffer your consequences

 theres a farming system with its mechanic

 random events that happen as you quest when you quest it has its little questing mechanic theres even auction houses in this game like novels

 freaking auction houses like the novel dont offend that young master

 as your sect grows youll find out it opens more things like sect wars

 theres a romance system wtf

 dragons and mythological creatures start attacking you literally gods how do you stop them

 theres even immortality advancements

 the devs want to add even more stuff to the game hot holy damn

 the game supports mods and has an ingame message board function giving hints and other god knows what

some of the bad stuff ive seen which some has mod to fix up
the fog of war mechanic is awful can be mod fixed
the diplomacy between sect could be redone and boring can be mod fixed
the micromanagement on the disciple practicing or cultivating is wonky mod fixed this
the micromanagement of talisman and items on your character is really tedious
itemization should be a list instead easy to switch out and in between
too much clutter of ui material which can be condensed way better


this game is goofy and with so much depth it makes up for the small problems and mistakes once you get the hang of it youll probably be pressing shortcuts on your keyboard like a boss
good luck my fellow cultivators and dont offend any big sects or young masters out there the whole point is to become powerful and not well known until you can handle the world as an immortal

you can play this game for hours straight this isnt a game that will take 10 hours to finish or even 24 or 38 or even 50 hours this game will take you days
days
like a cultivator
maybe even a month  before you can even come close to beating the amount of content and see everything

#####

if youre looking for rimworld in a different setting its unlikely youll enjoy this game while its in the same genre the games approach to complexity micromanagement and ui separate them into two very different games this game is much closer to dwarf fortress spliced with a squad based rpg im personally enjoying the face applied to sandpaper that is learning to play this game but despite knowing many people who enjoy rimworld and a couple other colony builder games theres not a single one i would recommend this game to

edit after 20 hours of fumbling with the controlsconcepts i finally realized this game actually isnt about survival at all the game is about long term planning incremental applications of perfection its even less like dfrimworld than i thought as very little adaptationreaction is required theres no real point in figuring out mechanics yourself so you can apply them in unknown future situations because ultimately they more or less converge on the communities favourite layouts and theres no real surprises in this game

setting

this game takes place in a fantasy world based on chinese mythology while that sounds familiar enough as someone deeply in love with western fantasy settings it took me a while to wrap my head around it you are in charge of a small outcast group of people who found a wizard towermonk schoolreligious sect the concept doesnt really exist in western fantasy so its hard to describe properly the ultimate aim is to become immortal and incredibly powerful id argue to become a god but gods dont exist in this setting as far as im aware the path to doing so involves becoming a martial arts master unlocking your qi mana and learning a law school of magic

to keep it simple youre training muscle mages

gameplay

the game starts out in a very familiar setting couple people with big dreams and a pile of sticks except dont build a house out of those sticks you only have enough for a timber cutting station and its annoying to figure out how to make more without a timber station

the ui is unintuitive somewhat carpal tunnel inducing and complex slightly better than df still its possible these ui setups are common in asian games they do tend to have different control schemes from what i remember of the odd asian mmo ive played theres an expansive set of tutorials that try to teach the basic concepts but theres 20 odd tutorials and none of them go particularly in depth while your eyes glaze over its worth noting the translation is actually pretty well done with only the odd exception like an empty room being described as devastated

the actual gameplay starts out as a simple colony builder but the complexity catches up with you the moment you dip your toe into the deep end and produce your first muscly boygirlshapeshifterthing their path to progression focuses more on consumption of boosting agents than youll expect coming from a western viewpoint creation of magic artifacts is likewise a mundane and common requirement although adventuring to find powerful ones is also part of the core activities worth mentioning that the concept of feng shui is a core mechanic base design has many hidden synergies that will impact the efficiency of your buildingstrainingartifact creation the game doesnt describe them in game very well so short of looking up guides or going back to tutorials you just need to memorize everything mostly its based on element compatibility though which is quite intuitive thankfully

one of the kickers is that laws schools of magic arent readily available to learn and straying from the suggested starter law gave me a support setup healingempowering others and making crops grow small comfort in the face of hostile sects and magical creatures not to say i was helpless my mage is more than capable of killing the paltry threats the game has thrown at me so far just by bludgeoning them to death ineligantly with artifacts but based on my last games mage being licked to death by a magic frog im certain theres a clock ticking before threats roll by that will require actual combat mages

its at this point where we run into the rpg elements character setup really matters i mean like it really matters in this game you have stat affinities for schools and potential caps on top of your usual skill list skill unlocks equipment management and room designing take up a lot of time in a game that already feels slow in my most recent game of 45 hours i feel like ive progressed about as far as id get in an hour of rimworld im sure ill get the basics more quickly with experience but jeez this game has a lot to work with as of yet i only have one mage but endgame videos show sects with 10 mages the micromanagement on that is mind boggling given what i understand of it at this point

the game also feels old not mechanically but i can feel the touches of our players are bored lets give them more mechanics to keep them interested from years of development its certainly part of what makes the game bewildering to the uninitiated

summary

i definitely think theres a type of player who will enjoy this but i cant think of a single person id suggest this game to due to the incredible complexity and lack of intuitiveness to quote my friend who watched me play this what does humanity gain by having a game this complex but hey i like it

just make sure its your cup of tea before grabbing it 23 hours will not give you enough of a look at the real game to know whether or not youll like it

#####

i got in because of sseths video i thought it was just a clone of rimworld i was very wrong first core was 8 lmao cant do it anymore higher than 7 this game is so fun got baited playing tribulation ix lost immidiately after few days 1010 must play

#####

the game is in a rimworld top down format that will be incredibly frustrating for rimworld players  the game is a bit esoteric and currently the most reliable source of information is the discord server  all in all i love this game and have over 80 hours in less than 10 days

good
cultivation feels very relevant and the gamewith a couple mods works to encourage  you to have your cultivators manage themselves

theming feels great i have yet to have a gameplay element feel out of place
runs extraordinarily well and i have yet to have a crash

the bad
the uitaskingmicro automation is a big step backwards for anyone who has played rimworld or oxygen not included

information on how to play the game is sparse and the in game information is far from sufficient
starting has little variety and the world is static and appears to have minimal changes between playthroughs
bugs are still relevant though i would say i have more uiplanning issues than bugs

#####

this game has so many mechanics and its pretty complex whenever i play this i have at least 5 guides open for the game i love it its an amazing game and the xianxia rimworld concept hit my buttons just right 1010

#####

its a game similar to rimworld but it has so many unique positions and outcomes i wouldnt even compare it this is coming from an americanthis game is awesome

#####

a really great game especially for those that enjoy the eastern fantasy genre saying this is like rimworld is like saying oxygen not included is like rimworld its similarities start and end at survival management game just waiting for the march release now and hopefully english translation with it

#####

this game makes no sense i dont know what im doing what is any of this 

1010 i actually cant stop playing

#####

after reading so many wuxia novels i still feel ill equipped to understand the monstrous task of building a sect how does yun che yang kai and other mcs do it oh right they just push all the responsibilities and headaches of a sect master on to their slaves cough innerouter disciples 

after 2 hours of fumbling around ive managed to build a small sect and only losing a couple of outer disciples after provoking a demon snake thats a start

its not as polished as rimworld but things could change in the future with more patches and mods

#####

great game but the mechanic takes a lot of time to learn such as 5 elements placement etc after 15 hours i still have like 40 of the game not explored

#####

not much to say about this one its like rimworld but alot and i do mean alot crazier and perhaps even better than rimworld in alot of ways they are both widely different games and both have their good qualities neither is better than the other your job is to build a schooldojo where you train disciples in the way of the super saiyan gods of legend and you can use your member as a weapon what more could you want really and instead of bandits which are still here you get attacked by sentient objects which can wreck your sht in a heartbeat entire buildings can attack you it gets crazy just play it play the damn game do it do it now

#####

one of the greatest video games ive ever played

entirely incomprehensible chinese dragon ball z rimworld 

no idea what im doing but i cant stop cultivating 



#####

ive enjoyed playing this game enjoyed it so much that just about all the time that ive spent on the game was just on the one ironman save after a few games to learn how mechanics work and so on ive even liked this game well enough to join its discord and in there ive seen a number of people comparing this game to rimworld 

and it does have some similarities the top down view characters coming to join your settlement sect randomly getting attacked by randos with some regularity i havent played rimworld myself but the core game loop seems quite similar 

but theres some important differences instead of organ harvesting peoples extra kidneys and selling them on the market you could have them learn a particular cultivation method in which case their treasure falls off you can then sell that for a few hundred spirit stones even but you could also say enchant it into a magical artifact for one of your combatants to use to defeat attackers be they people demon beasts or what have you you could also use particular miracles to turn that treasure into a sentient item then another one to turn that item into a new person who if you manipulate their stats the right way could turn out to be one of your most powerful cultivators then you could have them cultivate the same method go through reincarnation and repeat that a few times to get a collection of 7 of their treasures to arm them with as weapons but you know no kidney market 

this is a game where you can raise your little people into gods literally ascending them to the heavens and leaving a shine behind that can be used to buff the people left behind this is a game where you can make someone who punches so hard anything they fight dies near instantly this is a game where you can keep your head low and create a sweat shop that makes money by splitting money into bricks and then using those bricks to manufacture weapons that sell for a wide profit margin then buy your way into having various rare materials without having to get them the hard way adventuring or what have you this is a game where you can pick a fight with a dragon and watch in horror as all the water on your map buffs the water dragon and all your people swiftly perish to its wrath 

tldr if you dont know what cultivation is you can certainly find out by playing this game but you could also come swing by the official discord and ask questions there its a good community and a well priced little game

#####

so this game is basically magic ninja village rimworld

the basic premise is that you and a group of up to four others depending on the starting perks selected are refugees from a devastating attack on your sect by an unknown enemy which wiped it off the map your plucky group of survivors are now starting up a new sect while searching for clues as to who or what was behind the attack

im playing on immortal  ironman mode mostly because im sucker for achievements which you can only get on immortal runs but the fact that this also turns all the difficulty and event sliders up to 11 makes things more interesting it also prevents savescumming a mixed blessingcurse

so far the most exciting part of not having a save to fall back to is dealing with events
there was the time one of my cultivators traveled to another sect and was given the options of sneak around or leave id taken a day and a half to get there so i figured whats the worst that could happen the answer is the other sect finds you pokes out your eyes and rips off all your limbs allowing the remaining torso to make its way back to your sect oh and your reputation with them goes down by 200 so theyre probably going to retaliate against you

while i would rate the translation of this game to be overall excellent theres definitely some ambiguity in some of the choices the most interesting that i ran into was having one of my cultivators run into an evil sects minions who were up to no good in a town and i was given the choices of help them insincerely help them and leave  ignore them

if you thought that insincerely help them would mean that youd help the poor townsfolk yeah not so much instead of ijusti causing regular evil mayhem your cultivator does that ufollowedu by backstabbing the evil sect and stealing their shit evil points galore and hatred from the sect you just screwed over

anyway its got some rough edges and it throws you in the deep end but its got an iexcellenti searchable ingame help function as well as an ingame wiki for just about every item and topic which is ioccasionallyi useful 

its been taking up basically all of my playtime over the last couple weeks  its got its hooks in me deep would recommend

#####

不知道我在干什么

#####

as a management sim fan this was a bit of a gamble but ive really enjoyed it the comparisons to rimworld cover the initial impression of the game as it uses the same top down view and control scheme but the actual game more closely resembles cultist simulator  the management game is there to support going on adventures with your characters and collecting cool things so they can cultivate better

while the tutorial introduces the basic concepts of the game it will feel bizarre and unintuitive at first the ui is a little awkward but with mods beginning to be translated most of that should be readily fixed mods are available on the main menu mod store  settings to enable picking up the show law stats mod will help new players a lot

#####

so i will say yes i recommend this game but only if you like cultivation novels more specifically xianxia novels andor if you like rimworld if you are completely ignorant of both those concepts this is not the game for you for folks coming from cultivation novels the game mechanics may throw you for a loop but the world will definitely feel familiar once you get into the actual game for those who play rimworld this will feel like a poor mans unfinished copy of an attempt at recreating rimworld that got stalled halfway through but the chinese fantasy themes will hopefully be enough to distract you from sheer lack of any quality of life mechanics in the game all and all this is a good game if you like xianxia and alright if you like rimworld i can not in good conscience say it is a great game and that i enthusiastically endorse it but if development picks back up ever this will definitely be a game to watch out for i dont lose 300 hours to bad games after all

#####

puny brat who doesnt know the immensity of heaven and earth why you dont buy this game yet

#####

my brownstone wall becomes selfconscious and walks away on its own 1010

#####

interface is both better more visuals and worse too much text compared to rimworld

i might recommend if they improve the sound effects but they are highly lacking in this department which is not good for a game of this price for example when a giant dragon appears on screen you dont hear anything when the weather changes it doesnt sound any different

overall the game has quite a bit of potential but it needs a lot more polish it feels as if they have this great complex idea but not the level of care needed to really make a great player experience

#####

how do i even begin im usually not the type to write reviews but here we go
the first 20 minutes i was completely overwhelmed by this game and had to turn it off everything was happening so much and so fast
but then i really got into it made a ton of mistakes and started a new game file where i didnt achive anything much yet after 20 hours still i love it a lot especially for the reason that some things in this game are just baffling with how ridiculous they can feel 
my knowledge of xianxia isnt that good i just know some of the rudimentaries and i feel like knowing a little bit more about this chinese genre of fantasy might be helpful
also i turned the voice over from english to chinese because the english vo was recorded sort of badly this ladys hard consonants always pop because she apparently recorded without a pop filter its quite offputting

all in all solid simulation game about micromanaging your people also learned a bit about feng shui in this one haha

#####

this was definitely one of my best value to hrs spent games its got a long list of sub systems to figure out and creating a new cultivator can offer quite the challenge and rewards  the integrated comments section for help while in most games is tedious with profane jokes this community made sure to elevate the best suggestions  cant wait for the 2nd game

#####

very hard to understand as a beginner but once you do its incredibly fun
as a wuxia cultivation manhuanovel reader i love this

#####

one of my favorite base builder games of all time you have to have a certain grind mind set to truly enjoy this game but as a fan of wuxia and chinese daoist immortal tv series i love this game and you will too if you enjoy the genre

#####

i am totally lost
i love it

#####

15 hours in and still feel like i have no idea what im doing

if you like difficult games with tons of mechanics to figure out and perfect this is right up your alley feels like rimworld if you installed dozens of chinese themed mods and is a very fun and interesting experience

the only bad part of the game is the social mini game install a mod instead to max out all relationships to 100 dont play the social mini games

#####

great game but its not for everyone it is not rimworld it is a complex game with many mechanics and you need outside guides if you want to do any meaningful progress if you want a charming sect simulator with deep systems where you can ascend your disciples to godhood with all the webnovel cliches its great if you want a chill colony builder its not that i can say 3 negatives the tutorial is non existent you absolutely need to dig up guides for it the speech system and the way you progress the story is crap so just mod it out and finally its similarly bloated as webnovels luckily there are all kinds of mods to tailor the experience to your taste and the game is fantastic if you are willing to learn the systems

#####

if you wish for pain you will receive this game is absurdly complicated and you will be on google very very much even after my 20 hours i have only somewhat begun to understand the very foundation of the beginning parts of this game that said the game is very deep and expansive so if youre willing to put in the effort i think this game could be something you put a tremendous amount of time into far more than i have

#####

if you like watching numbers go up magic and rimworld give this game a shot

#####

rimworld meets wuxia

could use some more qol that rimworld has and jesus fuck it is not well explained but sweet googly moogly its a fun game

#####

yep its addicting

its much deeper than it looks and to be honest in 80 hours i played this game so far i didnt even make it to the endgame

#####

this is not the game you think it is

only superficially does this game resemble dwarf fortress or rimworld while its true that theres basebuilding mechanics and emergent stories that arise from the hilarious accidental interaction of character backgrounds and skills all of that is really secondary to the game itself a martial arts cultivation game

this is a roguelike wuxia sectbuilding game where the objective is to iterate on your martial arts acquisitions to create better and better martial artists to challenge new and stronger threats in that sense its similar to rw or df where  as time and your worth increases  so do the strength of your enemies unfortunately the game is ridiculously complex for beginners with serious dauntingly hard walls of complexity that can only be overcome by reading endless guides and wiki entries ive played the game for 100 hours and most of that time was spent building spreadsheets and reading up on the details of critical and lethal mechanics such as character creation mandatory mods basebuilding feng shui yaoguai advancement and more and ive barely scratched the surface

it doesnt help that a lot of the beginner tutorial and walkthrough videos out there are terrible i recommend jklfiveones videos youre going to spend a lot of time on the discord asking questions that have been asked a million times by tons of other people because the game is just that complex

is it rewarding though yes

if youre willing to slog through all that learning and modding and spreadsheeting before you play youll have fun learning the ins and outs of this game just like df or rw youll make lots of stupid mistakes in your early runs just like you would in other games of the genre youll build on your failures until you too can have a thriving sect that survives the gorgeous combats and threats that come trampling and flying into your map

so to sum up this is not really a basebuilding game thats secondary its a martial arts lineage game that tells the same story on the same timeline every run your goal is to build  in traditional roguelike fashion  faster and faster each run to produce great martial artists who can survive these timed challenges on the low difficulties thats easily doable once you understand the systems on the high difficulties youll need luck skill and lots of planning spreadsheets to advance in an optimal fashion

if you like complex games and you like df and rw youll probably like acs

#####

it pains me to give a bad review to a game ive spent so much time playing the main reason ive spent so much time in this game is because it fails at explaining its own mechanics despite a lengthy tutorial even with the countless guides and very active discord it still took this much game time to learn the many mechanics and put it all together

after all that after all the testing and learning and installing countless mods to fix blatant gaps in both qol and functionality  i found the game to be relatively shallow buggy imbalanced and lacking polish everything you do in this game takes an immense amount of time and repetitive effort and the payoff just isnt there 

i have legitimately only fought two of the three super bosses without the use of mods on your own youll likely never figure out how to fight the last two bosses if you do manage to figure it out from discussions on discord there are several layers of rng you will have to muddle through that will take you many hours if you do manage to spawn these bosses youll find depending on difficulty they either require tons of maxed out disciples which is a very long a repetitive task or are outright unkillable without the use of unbalanced mods

theres also a lot of mechanics in this game that are just bad bad to the point where i cant even fathom the mindset of the dev just antifun antiplayer disruptive unfinished and unavoidable garbage however you can workaround most of these glaring failures through mods

if the modding community continues to thrive this game might be worth the effort to learn at this time it was an incredible letdown after spending so much time figuring out convoluted and unexplained mechanics

super addictive

wow what a hidden gem of a colony sim 
anyone familiar with rimworld knows what to expect here but once you start diving into elemental balancing qi factories and beating a demon pig to death with a flying pair of artifact pants you start to realize just how much depth there truly is

1010 must own for any fan of the genre

#####

originally when i got this i thought it would be chinese rimworld but its very different i dont exactly know what im doing yet but the devs have put a lot of effort into the game and it is very deep and complex the mythology stuff is cool too

#####

this game is fantastic if youve played and enjoyed things like dwarf fortress oxygen not included black and white 2 and rimworld youll probably have a great time with it i came into it with very little knowledge of any of the historical and cultural background of a lot of the things discussed and am absolutely going to rectify that a breath of fresh air and an amazing achievement from a three person team i cant wait to see where they go from here because this is astounding and i know full well ive only barely scratched the surface 68 hours in 
id like to see the conversation system fleshed out a little and some more facial variety but i love the representation of different body types and also disability in the game it makes me happy to see that disability isnt treated as an all negative thing the game recognizes that becoming disabled can give positive life experiences and perspectives and thats very rare 


#####

the chinese players really know how to become literal gods

i mean you need an actual degree in chinese culture and religion in order to understand the game yet these guys are literal encyclopedias

#####

i dont really get this game but i think its fun

#####

yes if you like xianxia or xuanhuan 

this game has a lot of content personally i would like to see it expand it a bit especially on agriculture 
i hope they also expand the inner map where you build the sect and the world map that will improve the game a lot

#####

i dont recommend this game if you have anything greater then a 169 resolution monitor the gui interface are windows that are too large with any widescreen formats and the game is unplayable because of it its hard to believe in 2020 that game makers would still be wrestling with gui aspect ratio issues i will change my review if the dev fix this issue but as of the writing of this review the game is basically unplayable

#####

there is a english mod plus the game itself is fantastic cant wait for the developers to release full game in english so we can have a huge english modding community on this one

#####

hey hey people

it is one of the best games on the plat form i love it

#####

i have spent way too many hours on this game and loved every second of it

#####

this is without a doubtone of my favorite purchases this is a true gem the potential is incredible despite the slight learning curve i feel that i am getting better and better the more runs i do havent even touched the late game but i feel this game has enough depth to keep me entertained for well past 1k hours in my 14 years of playing games only two other titles deserve that accolade in my book

#####

never played rimworld so cant comment on that comparison  i will say that after a slow difficult start youll need guides to play this game but youll need to play a bit to understand the guides at least i did this game quickly becomes addictive and a huge timesuck  enjoy

#####

ima bout to reach 9 hoursin tutorial yep you heard me they have a checklist of all the things you need to know in the game and you can choose to do any of them or skip so when you actually play the game you dont play blind 

just thatits quite a lotlike maybe 10 hours a lot lol

#####

to use words to describe it would not be appropriate  
you have to experience it  

can you get past day 200

#####

first of all rimworld and this game are two different game are we done cool this game is soooooo much complex deep and rich than a vulgar rimworldlike the lore and chinese culture are adding different layers of micro managing to the characters and the environment here you are not surviving i mean yes you have to lol but  thats not it you are trying to reach immortality and you will see that in this game talent of your characters is important this game concept is a bit aggressive to beginners as there is a lot of mechanism and concept that you need to understand and the interface doesnt exactly cover everything however once youre starting to catch on with the gameplay you will turn into an optimisation maniac
 even if you cover all the tutorials and they are many trust me you wont get some little details unless you are a careful reader or search for help on internet or know about the culture the learning curve is my be a bit slow in your first games but once it clicks it clicks you can have all the fun you have growing your new cultivator sect and its powerful immortals my personal problem would be how the game deal with firefighting but hey thats me im i the only one with lazy cultivator that wont helps workers fight the fire

if you are new on this game i can recommend you this google doc httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1vgern1jijnulll6z4bvom4l8pz1yktrkpoccwdd5ncedituspsharing
 
but after you experienced some few games by yourself as there is a lot in it
you can also visit this growing fandom about the game for extra info
 httpsamazingcultivationsimulatorfandomcomwikibeginner27s_guide

in sum i highly recommend and i will be waiting for updates


#####

as a dwarf fortress rimworld and kenshi fan i can definitely say amazing cultivation sim is up there with the rest of the great colony simulators and distinguishes itself easily as something similar but significantly different at the same time   im only just dipping into the surface but so far i can already tell ill be a couple hundred hours into this game in no time  love the art the music and the focus on building up a sect is just a lot of fun so far  commands and ui etc could definitely be improved but as i am also pretty used to dwarf fortress acs arrives somewhere in the middle between df and rimworld when it comes to accessibility and easeofplay and i expect that to improve in the coming monthsyears  

overall really glad i picked this up and definitely suggest others to dive in as well who may be on the fence but thoroughly love rimworld df and kenshi

#####

rimworld on crack

#####

120 hours and i still dont know anything past early game rimworldlite colony building but instead of trying to escape the planet youre trying to cultivate an immortal super saiyan that can kill basedestroying bosses

#####

cultivation games are a supe rarity and im really excited to see one come to the west

#####

the comparison to rimworld basically ends at the surface level whereas that game is about the ensemble cast and the stories surrounding a location amazing cultivator simulator is very much about the individual characters and their quests to transcend the ordinary so sure rimworld except if your dudes flew around on swords and fought dragons and got insulted by sentient lampposts

#####

hey hey people sseth here

this game makes quantum physics look like preschool topic

#####

i have no idea what im doing but my spirit has ascended to heaven so it must be ok

#####

ive had it for a day and a half ive played for 18 hours send help and some food

#####

almost every item in this game can be commented on in game each feature has been explained in detail by multiple users this means that you can avoid referring to external walkthroughs and explore the features the game has to offer within the bounds of the game itself i see that this game is being review bombed due to the monetized mobile port which i cannot comment on but the pc version is something i truly enjoy i absolutely love this game despite its flaws and encourage you to give it a try if you have ever read a wuxia novel or manhua and enjoyed it then this game will likely entertain you for hours to come it certainly has captivated me with its deep complexity and charming take on cultivation and sect life

#####

do you like it when numbers get bigger

btw you really dont need a guide but you do need to do a practice run where you pretty much try to rush the next stage and the next stage and the next stage in order to really get an understanding of the game

kinda makes sense why the immortal difficulty is considered the real difficulty of the game btw the default settings are easy mode but if you never played the game before they are useful to learn with

#####

playing this game is like working on a thesis you need to read a lot

#####

you can have you privates fall off so you can become a god then craft your lost phallus into an artifact that now topples kingdoms

this is just one of many stories already do yourself a favor and buy this game

#####

i was hesitant since there is like no information on the internet about this game but i am enjoying it a lot 
if you have an inkling that you might like this game you probably will i havent even gotten to end game yet but theres so much depth already and im always thinking of plans on what ill do in the future while im not playing
can only imagine it will get better over time but even if they never touched it after today its still an excellent game

#####

straight up chaos very in depth alot of stuff youre gonna need guides andor multiple tutorial replays for still good fun game and it is definitely something you can sink enough time into to make it worth buying

#####

edit a 100h later  ok this games is like crack cocain i cant turn it off please send help

just when i thought i understood this game the bad guys spawned and reckt all i built and killed my 2 golden cores im loving it plus a big part of the game is bitching on the sects leaders its so fun 

#####

coming from extensive rimworld playtime this game is a treat

even so it is confusing the start is your basic rimworld experience with a little added nuisance build up rooms get a basic economy going make sure everyone doesnt eat their own shoe however once you get your first inner disciple small warning they stop working after this the real meat of the game begins as you start your own school based on a selection of laws and the game opens up to a more civilizationcrusader kings vibe

still have to maintain your populace and need to keep a balance of outer disciples workers and inner disciples monkswarriors though eventually you can add golems into the mix for additional workforce

the ultimate goal is to become the biggest sect but this game is a long one you will spend a long period of time growing i was about 5 hours in my first game before i had acquired my first inner disciple which put a kink in things as she was my primary cook at the time then you notice it will take a long time before that inner disciple makes any real progress in their training so when picking up this game expect the long haul but it is a beautiful long haul

graphics wise this game has a gorgeous aesthetic from the trees to the buildings to even the grass and flowers and i could spend all day enjoying the scenery while my new cook sets fire to the stove for the nth time

can not say much more as i havent made significant progress into the game barely scratching the early game but the short and sweet of it is if you enjoyed the likes of rimworld you will most certainly enjoy this game

#####

great game if you like rimworld youll love this kind of like rimworld meets dr strange it has an immortal setting which makes the game harder in several different ways but acts as an ironman mode as well this means one save and so far after a little play time my save says error and that i should delete as it is corrupted so i have to start a new game i wont play much anymore until more updates are done and i would recommend buying until then either how ya gonna make a dlc before fixing important game breaking bugs

#####

说真的这游戏真的一流但是美中不足自由度高但是随机性更高阻碍了自由创作的特点
例如
1经典模式创建人物时随机性太高我能理解属性随机可增加游戏趣味但是建议增加人物捏脸系统还有一些属性调度的系统这里说的属性是年龄因为当你要创建你所想要的角色时只能在那边按随机roll到你想要的角色为止但是属性和人物的建造不能分开当你终于roll到你想要的属性可是角色的模板不是你想要的比如说我想要个很有仙气味道的角色模板但系统就给个肥胖的矮子我不然就是年龄已经过半40几岁开局然后有完美情节的玩家就会像我一样重新roll角色直到roll到想要的人物模板年龄属性为止roll了半天就开始觉得枯燥不想玩了
 属性随机没问题但是请把捏脸系统和年龄调度分开

2建筑系统说真的已经几乎接近完美无可挑剔但是希望后期增加建设方向旋转模式因为所有工作台等等全部都是向北边感觉很别扭对不起以上都是强迫症玩家的意见

3食物系统耕田等等的系统已经完美了但是动物打猎就差一点除非你是大地图不然动物很快被你打完就没食物了要到隔壁村拿真的很麻烦还有游戏里有湖畔河流但是角色却不能钓鱼

若能把以上改善游戏肯定更好

#####

ive been reading about the dao for years check out some wuxia or xiania novels to understand the concept of this game   i stumbled onto this and its one of my new favorite games  game is polished but translation can have issues other than that its money well spent

#####

one of the best simulation games ive played  its full of deep and esoteric mechanics begging to be mastered  use of external resources is mandatory for understanding the game ingame tutorial is super barebones but the learnexecutesucceed loop is extremely gratifying

#####

need a big brain

#####

i am convinced this is not an amazing cultivation simulator it is a buddhist hell simulator a layer of it where all you want to do is build a house but all anyone wants to do is practice kungfu

#####

fun game about a few people who go from wondering how they will survive the next few nights to over enough time being able to punch mountains violating the celestial order and creating their own inner heavens with the power to commit massive genocide if someone wishes really hard for it

#####

this game is a great pickup on sale only if youre willing to do some homework about game mechanics

if youre a fan of wuxia and the concepts enough youll likely have no problem being interested enough to learn about things like how to build a house to have the proper elemental feng shui for the person living in it

if you dont bother looking up guides or youtube videos the game doesnt teach any of these things to the player in any meaningful way and you really wont accomplish much or have much fun id wager

if you do learn about how the mechanics work you can definitely get many hours of addictive fun out of it
