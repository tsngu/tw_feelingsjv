after spending almost 150 hours in this game its safe to say ive given up

ive mostly ignored all the comments at first so that i can give an impartial view of this game 

foremost cities skylines 2 is broken it is riddled with many serious algorithmic and performance bugs that affect core functions of the game widely reported bugs such as frequent crashes and taxation glitch which causes unexpected income and deficit spikes that breaks the gameplay  and this is just one of many serious ones out there 

while it is understandable for bugs to be present in games and software colossal orders lack of urgency and genuine interest in tackling bug reports makes it unacceptable 

its been 3 months since launch yet recent statements from the company were deliberate in evading questions on roadmaps for bug fixes and attempt to obfuscate users by saying that something is being worked on for the near future 

hard to believe that this is the same company that made cities skylines 1  a realisation of what the company once was for now stay away until more is done 



quick update  29 jan

ive given this game another shot with a fresh install and a new city  issues remain and let me summarize my experience

 at first glance cities skylines 2 provides many qualityoflife improvements compared to cities skylines 1 such as better road building and modern assets 
 youll find that it is now a breeze to build roads highways and intersections tools are intuitive and easy to use want an intersection just drag across an existing road and youll have an intersection want a roundabout just plop it down 
 assets are refreshed as compared cities skylines 1 gone are the cartoonish buildings and vehicles 

however most of the gamebreaking issues start occurring as you progress into the game 

game stability and optimization
 as your population increases game simulation will slow to a crawl  despite my setup being well above the recommended specs 
 occurs on my two different cities and save files 

service mechanics
 garbage management and healthcare vehicles will regularly depart from their facility and return almost immediately alerts will popup frequently that healthcare and garbage management is inadequate despite well within their capacity
 buses trams and trains will frequently and randomly despawn or stop working completely 

economy and industry
 taxation for industries will become highly erratic due to an algorithmic bug taxation income will fluctuate randomly by the millions for a town of 10k citizens completely breaks the budgeting and financial system 
 local industries will not export goods cargo terminals both air and train will hoard all mail and breaking the mailing system also impacts citizen happiness
 as confirmed by many others due to a land value bug prices will increase to astronomical levels which makes residential suitability zero for most parts of your city and its outer suburbs 
 this the most critical bug since it completely stops the progress of your city and game as residential demand will be zero and no new citizens can move in
 
these are just some of the numerous bugs i came across while playing this game   you do find yourself having to look up online for any workarounds whenever you come across one 

while im almost certain that these issues will be addressed eventually in the future but is this what it is expected of a published game that cost 50 was this game ready to be published in the first place 

after two gameplays and two cities one thing is certain for me  cities skylines 2 would not have passed qa and should not have been published in the state it is in this game is in beta

#####

theres two directions i can take this review one is i recommend but  and the other is i dont recommend however  and theyre both probably going to say the same things strap in and grab a cup of hot chocolate daddys gonna tell stories again

if i compare my experience playing the first game on release to this one on release this one is much much better but how

the original cities skylines was a relief from the crushed dreams of simcity fans it came in as the rightful conqueror of the city building genre and built a huge community of gamers designers and modders that have influenced the growth of the game since it refined the simcity style beyond expectations it broke the gridded city building style it introduced gamers to urban design and planning ideas that they have never thought of before and a whole subgenre of urbanist youtubers rose up from this however when you compare the two vanilla games without the mods and dlc and hundred of youtube content creators the first game is great but a bit empty it didnt start with a daynight cycle that was added in after dark it didnt start with many of the best transit options they came in later dlcs inland water treatment plants didnt exist until 2020 with sunset harbor

cities skylines 2 starts with everything that the base game should have it doesnt only have a daynight cycle it has seasons it doesnt just have different zoning densities it has mixed use zones you dont just place down industry building and print money the game has a diversified economy hearkening back to simcity2000 when you could individually manage tax rates for different industries but here you can do that to the entire economy you can encourage and develop an economy based on retail and services or primary industries or manufacturing of any kind you dont just have buses trains and planes you have the option to use taxis buses trains trams subway metros planes and boats to transport your people and cargo outside cars and trucks to build the city you dont just lay down roads you can plan curves and bends and intersections using the various feedback that it gives you create clean interchanges and intersections and use a variety of tools to limit turns and eliminate traffic conflicts you can even obverse traffic accidents affect your roads and disasters affect the city pollution affecting the environment and a myriad other things that you didnt even think of when the original was released in 2015

compared to that yeah no questions

so why is everyone saying yes but 

i wont repeat it in detail youve already read the other reviews basically expectations for the games performance and delivery were misaligned between the developers the publishers and the consumers performance issues were a huge problem right off the bat because most people do not have systems that meet the requirements of the game but the developers have been tasked with making the game suitable for console misaligned expectations the games economic system was too opaque to clearly understand what was going on to the point that unsubstantiated rumours began spreading that the economy was fake its not feedback to the user was not adequate to completely understand what was going on and many players assumed things were bugs when they were not misaligned expectations

however the performance issues and opaque ui feedback aside none of this was helped by the myriad of bugs that have since seen six major patches to clean up with more work to come out after the christmas holidays

finally to nail the point home about misaligned expectations content i came in to the original game in march 2015 right on release i was with it the whole way through i was there when the beacons were lit and gondor called for aid i didnt even bother using mods until 2019 because thats when they were interesting and mature enough to really make a difference in the game by the time the great plague of 2020 hit the original was primed to receive huge interest in the game content on the workshop exploded youtubers exploded everything exploded it was wild so when in early 2023 the new game was announced a host of gamers came in with huge content expectations and none of the context youtubers speculated on the most insane speculations people were having meltdowns about the new engine staying on unity instead of hopping over to unreal engine wild

and so on release despite having literally been released with more tools and content than city builders have ever had with all of the good ideas from everywhere in the broader community being incorporated into the base game the chief criticism was a lack of content the game felt empty grey uk gray us graey wtf critiques went from blasting cs1 for being too cartoony to blasting cs2 for being too realistic with its browns and concretes at this point i stopped listening to shameless and pointless often contradictory criticism and looked for genuine concerns

these are easy to list
 the game is still in need of more performance fixes
 the games ui needs more obvious indicators of whats going on with underlying systems
 the game is a resource hog
 tools still feel a bit unrefined
 there are missing options that would make things so much nicer props prop tools decorative tools etc
 no mods at the moment we want mods
 no editors no map editor no asset editor none of that yet
 console version still needs to be released
 the bug issues have delayed the ultimate editions q4 and q1 dlc releases
 there are still some major bugs that require further investigation

to be frank though my stance is straightforward bugs can be fixed and these issues will be ironed out over time the devs have repeatedly shown that they intend to see this through

so yes i recommend but  be mindful of the things that are still to be fixed and you may enjoy the game i dont recommend however  set your expectations appropriately and you will realise this game has enormous potential to be the definitive game of the city simulation genre the first game rightfully conquered the crown this one will keep it even it has to fight for it

#####

fix your game
when biffa diana and city planner plays are reducingending their cs2 content you guys know you took a wrong turn somewhere
also please dont have people who cant speak to people adress the community and call them toxic when most of the community is behind you and adressing constructive feedback but is really really dissapointedtired
get some consultants in pr because you guys made several blunders since launch

i believe in you in cs2 and the devs behind the game management marketing and community engagement need to do a 180 asap

i will change my review when major bugs have been squashed when the simulation is actually a simulation and when tonedeafness will have dropped significantly

great ea title really not a 10 yet 

this is tough love but still love

cities skylines ii  the game where everything is made up and nothing matters 

its the game equivalent of the dj pushing all kind of buttons on his mixer that is not plugged in while an mp3 just plays on his ipod 

do not spend money on the game in its current state if you expect a city builder that actually simulates the behaviour and movement of people and  goods right now the game is just a tool to build something that looks visually like a city but has no inner logic or function people and vehicles are just animated background noise their behaviour barely influences any important metric and all your game play decisions dont influences them alt all a few examples

 i build a ore mine on an island with no road connection before i could even finish the passenger ship connection there are 60 workers employed at the mine that must have swam over there i finish the ship connection but not a single physical person steps onto the island looking at the stats the mine is producing a couple hundred tons of ore per month not a single truck moves anything out of the mine to the cargo terminal 

why do i build a passenger and cargo connections when people and physical goods do not even need them in a city building game that is all about managing the flow of people and goods

 because the animated people and carstrucks that you see in the game have absolutely no influence if your city works or not all your game play decisions have no real consequences you would think if you build a shitty city where people are stuck in traffic and cant get to work there will be a negative consequence but because the person doesnt need to be physically present at work it matters zero if you build a highway from their door to the office or have no physical connection at all there is no motivation to do anything because there is no consequences either way

 the people physically present in the game do not behave in a way that is understandable you click on a random person just getting of the train leaving the station to find out that they are going to work on the other end of the map where the train just came from because there is no way to show the actual path you have no clue why they took the train away from their destination

 even if we ignore that the game has no internal logic and rules your still building ghost towns my current build of 10k people looks like a big city with highrises and all but there are maybe 110th of the actual people around no real traffic problems because there are very few cars around if you think that is because of public transportation think again busses trams and co have mostly 1 5 utilisation the industry that is on paper producing thousand tons of goods have the occasional truck driving around 

 rush hour does not work at all all streets have a graph that shows the traffic flow over the course of the day and every single road has a flat line that does not vary depending on time if you have only every tenth person on the road at least have them leave their house all at the same time

in conclusion im very disappointed that they spend so much time to develop a super complex simulation and then decided that non of it actually matters it feels you are looking at a animated picture of a city while there is a complicated excel spreadsheet  on the other monitor crushing random number and they hope you are dumb enough not to notice that they have nothing to do with each other

i really liked cs1 spent over 800 hours on it and spent an assload on dlc but i always felt the vanilla game had some limitations and while modding helped it required a lot of time and effort to make things look good so does cs2 solve these issues some of them yes but they managed to screw up a bunch of other things

h1the goodh1
the new road tools are the best thing the new game does and allow for the same level of road building as modded cs1 but with far less effort and time the new buildings look much nicer and are far more consistent than cs1s vanilla ones

h1the mehh1
performance is playable but i had to lower the graphics settings ryzen 3600 rtx 2070

theres also a lot of attention to detail things that are missing that cs1 had but i cba to list at the moment

h1the badh1
the simulation isnt just inadequate bits a downgrade from cs1sb i could list all the bugs and issues people have had but other reviews have already covered that so ill sum it up as simulation feels utterly disconnected to what youre building which is even more annoying when you consider that cs1 was actually okay in this regard

the solution to traffic jams in cs1 was to use the pathfinder tool to find where cims were going and where the bottlenecks were bthey removed it in cs2b and have flat out said they wont readd it i suspect the reason for this is because if they did it would reveal how broken the simulation actually is

although the road builder is great there is no smooth slope tool like the fine road anarchy mod had this is a minor complaint and could easily be fixed with an update

another issue is the way buildings affect terrain a crematorium just flattens the land having visited an irl crematorium i can assure you this is definitely not how they work the grid system also hasnt been improved since cs1 so we cant have nice connected eu buildings

then theres mod support for some reason paradox is ditching the steam workshop for their own service which could have questionable longevity and support mod support was coming urlhttpsforumparadoxplazacomforumthreadscitiesskylinesiimoddingandperformancefaq1601872shortly after releaseurl there still isnt official mod support after 3 months but the beta will be starting soon

h1closing thoughtsh1
do i regret buying this game no i got plenty of time out of it and i really enjoyed playing with the road tools plus i got it from a dodgy key reseller so i didnt pay full price if i did pay full price id be pretty pissed i also think that if you are a hardcore cs1 player you will probably find some fun in this

honestly i have little faith for the future of this game paradox seem to be more interested in saying it is what it is than sorting out all the bugs and design issues making cs2 a glorified city painter something that modded cs1 was already really good at if you could be bothered to invest the time maybe im wrong maybe they will fix the simulation or more likely a modder will in which case this would make a good base for an amazing city builder

the greed and rushed development may have got paradox a quick profit but it has resulted in a base game with fundamental flaws that cannot be patched out and while they may have the money of suckers like me now we are less likely to stick around and buy the dlcs which are the real cash cow as gaben said late is just for a little while suck is forever

h1should you buy this gameh1
right now at full price god no wait for a sale 50 would be justified for a city builder enthusiast 80 for anyone else

#####

ceo blaming the community for the backlash of releasing an unfinished game is wild people paid for a finished game the game is not in early access so we expected a finished game

#####

i pray for the day when half baked full priced games are a thing of the past infuriating

#####

beware traffic simulation economy simulation and sim life simulation are not designed to work together 

bought the game performance issues not a big deal it will get sorted
playing along about 15 hours in you realize the deep simulation is fake
initially i realized there was a cargo bug nothing was getting exported via harbors or train or air cargo terminals
although that itself was bugged it revealed a huge issue that was put in by design
turns out the traffic simulation the economy simulation and the sim life simulation are all not connected to each other which makes them all not really impressive at all
sims have jobs but dont actually have to go to work same with school
businesses need goods to operate but dont actually need them to be exported or imported by the road system
you can have an industrial zone without any connections to the outside or the rest of your city and the economy side of things will work without issue via magical teleportation of goods and workers in a game that is supposed to model traffic and create rush hours as your sims go about their lives uhh yeah sure co 

deep simulation they said over and over again 
i feel deceived on this one and quite frustrated that i didnt realize it was all disconnected until past the refund period 
what the heck co i expected better than this 

feels like they couldnt get it all to work together and just released it anyway or the marketing team and the development team never talk to each other wow

#####

i say this with no hyperbole this game is so bafflingly bad it arguably has destroyed colossal orders reputation

cities skylines 1 arguably revived the city building genre and was a critical darling it had flaws but it was at its core a product with legs and heart behind it and its community was well earned

cities skylines 2 feels like a cheap mobile game like world box or something where you just place objects and get pretty views

on the one hand a lot of people play cities as more of a model set rather than mechanical game so in some ways cities 2 is better because you can get a prettier view but the default assets often are very repetitive and you cant currently mod in anything to get variety or to customize your city and many of the mechanical aspects of the game dramatically interfere with making a city that looks just the way you want it so while you can get some good shots that look sort of like a real city you cant get some of those magical moments you can in cities 1 where you set up everything juuuust right and have created a city of your dreams

so the game launched without real custom cities but it could lean on its simulation aspects if it had any 

cities 2 promised to up the fidelity of the simulation to frankly silly and unbelievable levels i never believed you would really be able to follow individual cims and see that they have a cohesive life so the fact that doesnt actually work is fine the idea of trying to accurately model and track literally tens of thousands of interacting agents is stupid

the problem is almost no simulated element actually works cities 1 took a lot of shortcuts for its simulation but it had an internal logic that made sense and facilitated the core challenge of a city builder conflicting needs of different types of activity in a city putting pressure on your ability to lay things out and connect them because while things didnt have formalized connections you still had a clear logic of what sort of resource would be demanded by what zone you plop and where they were likely to come from did it make sense that the industry building that was nominally making phones would receive raw meat and then ship out their finished products to a commercial building that was a donut shop no but on the macro level you understood that resources need to go to specific refineries which then go to industry zones based on distance which then created abstract goods that needed to get to commercial zones while generating traffit

 cities 2 has a detailed economy that tracks companies specific industries and supply chains supply and demand production ect and it doesnt work its a downgrade from 1 because goods just teleport you literally dont need to do anything the game has all these bars and graphs that say x industry needs more ore products but you dont actually need to ensure they can get them and that makes sense because you cant actually set up things on that specific industry level anyway so even if the system worked it would be a nightmare but instead it just doesnt work at all and you can just toss anything anywhere at any time and basically not care because people and goods can teleport in a game primarily about connecting zones

this isnt even going over bugs like with education the core concepts of cities 2 dont really make sense which is why i am not surprised they are fake but its baffling that in a game for simulation nerds they would ship something so transparently broken and nonfunctional and worse than 1 when they could have just made a simulation like 1s with maybe more detail on industries better road making tools and the new density system its just so confusing why the game is like this and why they just made something that doesnt work and never likely will work

just play cities 1

hmm this is going to be a tough review

much like everyone else i was very excited by the game when they announced and showed it 

when i first starting playing it i was enjoying my time with it but as the hours rolled by i think for me at least for now i cant recommend this game in its current state

man i wanted to truly like this game and sometimes i still do but well

a decent amount of the core features are improved the graphics style road placement and management and ui but at the same time there is also quite a lot missing barely improved or outright worse or missing 

for starters the game is buggy certain systems dont quite work or are planned out poorly especially the import export stuff then there is performance 

some people may excuse it but i for one certainly cant having personally worked in the unity ecosystem for 5 years i can personally say they dropped the ball here the graphics are great truly but the design and optimisation is going to take a lot to fix an i feel bad for the engineers behind the scenes 

as a fan and customer i personally feel there no reason this game should barely be lucky to hit 30fps at lowmedium on the best system costing thousands of dollars on the market especially when in a lot of areas the overall simulation while mostly better then cs1 its not that much better tbh 

this is made even worse when you realise most of the maps lack a lot of details that were in the previous entry including grass of all things 
that is not okay and other details overall you will find its just missing or lacking overall 

the service vehicles dont have animations there is less variety to all of the npcs and ai compared to the first game everything is sadly very static in regards to the world most of the ai is just going from a to b and you cant even see the direct path they are taking unlike the first game which makes management of traffic more annoying then it needs to be especially for a sequel

i think pets work now pretty sure ive seen dogs clocking in or walking home which can be more easily noticed once you hit 100k civs which yknow honestly is just a hilarious bug 

i have three civs in my city which have been standing still since 20k and are now old people one of them fucking died and whenever i want a laugh i just check up on them it is another funny bug

pretty sure dogs at launch floated as well

a lot of my very smooth roads have clipping issues into the void below on the sides of them an issue i dont remember being present in cs1

i found it really tough to make my city look and feel unique outside of tree placement and road and terrain layouts because the detailing is a feature that not only hasnt improved from the first game but is seriously much worse then cs1 and overly lacking 

from a distance everyones creations look amazing but when you zoom in aside from the awesome sense of scale which is a positive here in a massive way everything is the fucking same and it just sucks somehow less variety then cs1 at release side by side which makes no sense

like fences really i cant even place fences or quay walls which were in the first game i cant modify existing details within buildings or rocks and benches i can follow an npcs life path but god forbid i wanna actually make the houses they live in somewhat unique outside of naming with the same or similar tools the devs used to make them 

there is also very little in terms of variety for zone types which is kind of sucks considering this is suppose to be a sequel and placing specific zone types at times can be very frustrating like sometimes a certain house type will spawn for 99 of an area then for whatever reason wont for no real reason dont like it just remove the roads and start over and hope it works for the 2nd time or 3rd 

also no idea why a plopable rico isnt here in the base game the assets are there let me choose them please  

as time has gone on i have found myself finding more things that are were present in the first game but for whatever reason are not here or worse many things which are not improved at all 

for a sequel this really only has minimal major improvements of the first and the things which are improved they cant really make up for what is either worse or about the same as the first game

lane management is barely improved and its very frustrating to say the least combined with the traffic ai

at low pop its not so bad and honestly seems alright and they even have working suspension a cool small detail however once you get high up there the simulation starts to break and brain of the civs just goes out of the window its like suddenly at 60k and above everyone decided booze were for everyone 

i spent more time stumped at how brain dead the ai overall can be before attempting at trying to fix it 

i had massive traffic jams stretching for miles with my interchanges barely being used when i zoomed in they were all turning last second in multiple lanes some would do uturns sometimes more then once and just cause chaos which for me at least is made even worse as irl im learning to drive right now and the ai is making decisions i dont think i would ever make in a car even if i was 10 years old its insane 

not to mention services i have found the new feature of making them district restricted quite useful which is a positive but it still hasnt fixed the ai a dead person is waiting for transport right across the road from the cemetery what they are lucky that meteors cant be thrown willy nilly like in cs1  

i think this needed at least another year in the oven and if that wasnt an option early access at discount would of been better for the brand devs and community

that isnt the worst of it though for me its how they have responded the community initially and how they made sure to tell the creators before release not to mention the performance and giving them weird restrictions they knew exactly what they were doing and did it anyway from the announcement of the hardware requirements going up hidden in a larger message to banning a long time community member for valid criticism 

i think in time they can turn it around they did pretty good with cs1 and i think fully realised that games potential to the engine and design limits here i think the concept is good its just the execution the bones are here for a great game a lot of the core systems are in place begging to be polished or in quite a few cases outright fixed especially in regards to the overall simulation and i do love the art style more this time around although more variety is needed what i have experienced so far overall i can see the potential down the line but for now it is just not here yet sadly 

the more i play this game the more depressed i feel about what could have been yknow 

i love some parts of it but some other parts i just loathe and get annoyed im currently trying to make a very realistic city and im running into so many design limitations with the current toolset compared to the first game without mods it just kind of sucks 

i overall feel very mixed at times it can be really great and chill other times it can be the opposite

hopefully they can improve the overall performance fix all the major bugs  at times broken simulation add in the missing features that were present at the very least from base game in cs1 at launch and maybe just maybe we will have a good start to the sequel for dlcs free patches  overhauls for many years to come

if you want a proper sequel look elsewhere or come back in a year its a fine game overall even with the issues just dont go in expecting greatness some parts or better most are the same and some are worse then the first game

it isnt worth the full price not even close 40 aud max 60 aud with the extra content
510 great potential  sirjarko

maybe in a year it will be worth it lets hope

#####

the game needs to be better optimised and grinds to a halt when you get a few hundred thousand population  so many people saying but cs1 took 7 years to get to where it is   then i suggest you dont buy this until 2031

#####

holding out on content so they can drain us of our money with dlc the scheme is so played out now a days

#####

cs1 challenged my city planning skills
cs2 challenged my decision to buy it

#####

i currently have 1447 hours in cs1 and 171 in cs2 those 171 were just trying to make things work but mate im done cities skylines is my one and only i love it but i cant deal with this anymore ive dealt with my fair share of trams going on strike at stops for no reason locking up the whole network its a bug theyre dealing with it maybe poorly implemented lane control thank you thunderstore and poor inherent support of docks  quays also thanks thunderstore trains waiting in stations for reallife hours ludicrous flooding of elementary schools prior to their update but i cant get past the complete deadlock my surface streets have become due to the provided parking lots parking lots are a big problem because depending on the lot size they have only one or two inputsoutputs  and everybody wants in or out of there at the same time and with timecompression and yet realistic traffic modelling that is bad news for the entire traffic network ive built a huge network of parking lots but my result is that the parking lot jam is multiplied

my entire medium sized city of 150k is jammed solid  trams busses trains and all  nobody can get timely into the hundreds of provided parking lots  blocking every single street they are provided on at all hours of the day i decided to absolutely flood my city with subways to provide relief from the traffic  no change in the gridlock i provided the biggest most luxurious parking lots for the people commuting from outside the core  maybe theyd want to park their car and ride the any of the 35 metro lines ive built for my mediumsized city to ride into the central core no absolutely zero usage if they cant walk to a subway station then theyll just clog all the arteries and attempt to park in one of the silly amount of parking lots across town

with how this game operates i do not foresee an easy solution to this parking lot problem it is a great pleasant townscaper for small populations of up to 50k but past that the real strategy is you v colossal order

theres agentbased modelling like cities skylines and flowbased modelling like simcity 4 agentbased is great its more realistic on the aroads whereas flowbased is easy on cpu and totally lastgen but if youre going to commit to completely agentbased you have to realize timecompression has a huge factor on the broads

in summary 171 playtime hours later its still just another paidalpha

#####

over 500 hours ive played this game and im done heres the gist

list
 bthe amount of assets is dismalb every residential house looks the same and theres like three variants every other commercial building is a drab gas station every highdensity office building looks like a 20story gray concrete masonry column of sadness so gloomy so dull
 bthe lack of assets creates a horribly bland experienceb its not enjoyablerealistic in a city of 100k population to have three different house models and 100 office buildings that look like identical gray lego bricks
 bthe game is unplayable over 100k populationb speaking of large cities the gameplay and graphics come to a excruciating crawl once a citys population nears 100k 5800x3d processor 128 gb memory and a 4080 card doesnt matter slomo everything and thats with extensive performance enhancement tweaking of the settings
 bindustry doesnt matterb importing too much convenience food well too bad because building more industry to produce it locally will only spawn another hundred stone mills so youll have plenty of rocks being produced oh and deleting and respawning industry buildings does nothing except create more rock shops maybe after two hundred deletions you imayi get a timber plant
 bwhat about industry taxesb best to not mess with these going to 0 or even subsidizing industries to encourage production makes no difference also random industries will create literally hundreds of millions in revenue or cause a deficit in the hundreds of millions unless the tax rate is set to 0
 bok just importexport using cargo thenb not a chance in heck traffic gets so backed up at trainseaair cargo stations that trucks despawn and nothing is picked updelivered unless you build ten cargo stations across your city
 bbut just like in real life cargo stations will hoard local and outgoing mail rightb this doesnt happen in real life but in cs2 it does once a cargo station of any type is built it will hoard all your citys mail rendering post offices useless as no mail trucks ever pickup mail from the cargo stations
 bschoolsb elementaries are hugely comical in size no one goes to high school everyone goes to college
 bparksb no one goes to parks except the homeless who setup camp there and forget about building large beautiful parks like in cs1s parks dlc because that was left out for some reason and we were given boring generic parks
 bthe road tools are niceb
list

310

go back to cs1

edit i just cant quit you cs2

#####

still in beta state 6 months after the release but start selling empty dlcs 

#####

ive liked playing cities skylines 2 so far its definitely an enjoyable game with a lot of promise that being said the game does not get any points for being enjoyable and having promise the bar was much much higher for this game

while its not fair to expect cs2 to be as feature rich and polished as cs1 is so close to launch  it is fair to expect it to be fully functional to the extend we were promised from marketing

i can forgive the lack of assets i can forgive the bugs i can forgive that we were told that the game would initially launch without mod support and that mods would no longer be run through the steam workshop 

but more than 3 months after release colossal order has not been able to deliver timely updates to fix numerous bugs let alone deliver features that they promised mod support and console release keeps getting delayed performance has been getting better but it is still an incredibly demanding game for what it is 

in 2023 and now 2024 the sad reality which ive come to accept is that games will be released with bugs  lots of bugs what is completely inexcusable is that they are no longer pushing updates for bug fixespatches independently from dlc launches major patches will now be released alongside paid content 

in 2 years im sure this game will be better  but co deserves a negative review until then this game should be marked as early access and its price should reflect that do not buy this game until then youll have a better experience buying cs1  dlc and modding it to your liking

#####

thanks for the chats all but im moving on 
edit nov 17 ive heard from paradox support to the query i logged they confirm i was banned for this post where i said publishing games as bare bones as possible even removing content to plunder later looking at you prerelease dlc that cs2 has is customer abuse imo

the paradox support person went on to state frankly i would have issued a much sterner infraction than the minor trollish comments one you got for that i can provide a screenshot of the email to those interested

my comment got me a one month ban proves my point

original post starts here
i love city building games i mean the ones where you can build up massive modern metropoliss like in this game i remember getting my hands on simcity back in the old days and instantly fell in love with it i would lay down roads zones services for the city and watch it grow at my hands and i loved every single city builder that came along the various simcity versions except 2013 cities xlxxlall the versions city skylines and highrise city simcity 4 is definitely my most favourite of the city builders

when i heard that cities skylines 2 was being made i got pretty excited but also pretty worried i was really excited because a new game in my second favourite type of game was coming out and the videos made it look really good but i was worried worried because paradox was publishing it

when cs1 came out it was an instabuy for me i really enjoyed the game i was happily playing along making cities and then the dlc start coming out before cs1 came out for years i had bought paradox games and the dlc however i was really getting annoyed by the dlc policy of paradox cs1 came out on the heels of the 80th or something dlc for crusader kings 2 not to mention the countless dlc for hoi and eu that i also played so when the dlc starting coming out thick for cs1 i decided it was time to bow out of paradox and put them on the list the list contains the publishers i will not buy games from theres a few now including ea for what they did to simcitymaxis paradox had joined them i did not buy a single item from paradox after june 2017 i wanted to believe me but this was my very minor protest against their dlc policy

and then came cities skylines 2 i actually held my ground until the day before release i knew if i bought in id be buying into the dlc flood i was really conflicted i knew paradox was going to dlc the hell out of the game and there was the performance announcement before hand but i knew from experience with my work that performance can and usually does get fixed but i really wanted to play a city builder so i caved and bought the standard edition hey at least i would minimise my losses to 70 aud

the day came and i downloaded it and started to play after changing a few graphics settings i was okay with sitting on medium graphics and tuning a few things like rps suggested to and i played

but it wasnt too long before i started noticing things but i kept playing i noticed even more things and read about similar things others were noticing on the paradox forum and here i got to 25 hours and wrote my review i didnt want to give a cheap 2 hours review so i gave the game an honest shot i was actually really shocked how popular my review became i just wrote what i honestly saw in the game

then the hostility began i found myself banned for 3 days at paradox forums for the most flimsy of reasons the review was being discussed there and i commented on that thread at around the same time i started getting threats and hostile posts on my steam profile my workshop items for other games and ended up playing whackamole deletion of posts no point reporting as they were level 0 empty profiles just made to attack me but i did keep playing because maybe they had a point maybe id misunderstood some things

anyways eventually i hit 85 hours i was done i did an update to my review and my 3 points that i feel kill the game for me stand they are
1 performance and bugs whilst performance had improved on the graphics side over 250k pop my pc would start suffering from repeated stuttering this was simulation not graphical the list of bugs is massive just look at the confirmed list on paradox forums
2 lack of content the extreme lack of content is really disappointing obvious hat tip to dlcing us to hell yeah theres a content creator pack of some couple thousand assets coming for free but i would put a hundy on it that the original point of that pack was to introduce paidfor curated special content on paradox mods but they are  their pants and giving it for free now
3 design choices there are lots of design choices that just simply dont make sense

it was at this time that i posted a new thread on paradox forums outlining the above and that i was putting the game down for now shortly after that thread was posted i found myself banned for a full month i have read carefully the code of conduct the infraction matrix and also the support page on forum user rules i cannot see anything i could have legitimately been banned for i can only think it was because i have been vocal in honest criticism its not the only time paradox has been caught censoring their forums of negative feedback their code of conduct and support page also give you some instructions when banned contact the moderator in the instance or if you cannot contact that moderator email adminparadoxinteractive the irony is when you are banned you cannot access the messaging system to read the notice why you got banned nor can you reply to it so ive tried emailing politely the email address a couple of times ive had no reply i dont believe i will get a response either

so at this point i am done i feel that my feedback is not wanted nor do they want to hear it i believe that paradox doesnt want me around and i will just continuously be banned at paradox forums and if i continue to post here banned here as well i actually dont think this post will last long but hey lets give it a try ill screenshot it and post it to my steam profile avanya cant get to me there hahaha

i will never ever buy another paradox product my experience with paradox in the past and especially recently is that they are a hostile abusive company that will stop at nothing to suppress honest critical feedback that they believe may impact their shareholder profits my belief that paradox is an extremely toxic company has been reinforced with my recent interactions with this company i will never engage with paradox forums again i will never engage with any of their product or the products of any company that has an association with paradox i am completely done with this company

to everyone ive chatted with here go in peace and have some fun thank you all of you for the fun times i had here even you stealthy even though i still think youre a paradox employee here to muffle out any negative comments you never did answer my question but its okay youre off the hook now 

my review httpssteamcommunitycomprofiles76561197998739866recommended949230
paradox thread i got one month ban for httpsforumparadoxplazacomforumthreadsitstimetoputcs2down1608679

this is the state of co and paradox as a entirety this one persons feelings has everything i have to feel about paradox they have gotten to the point that they just ban criticism because its mean this game along with ck3 and vicky3 clearly show that we are little more than cattle for pdx to harvest for money friends its time to retire from playing pdx games its been a good ride but all things must come to an end

#####

it is not a bad game and i enjoy it but asking 50 for a game which have not been properly beta tested and ships with a whole range of bugs is abysmal then two months after release you would expect that colossal order has fixed most of these bugs yet almost all of them still exist 

generally speaking it also seems like a lot of the features have not been properly tested for instance you cannot move or even delete an external buildingupgrade without deleting the entire complex of buildings with upgrades even if that single building burns down you have to delete the entire complex of buildingsupgrades snapping is full of weird bugs and the tools are tedius bus lanes dont work regular cars will just use them anyways and you cannot change which lanes in an intersection goes to where

#####

the potential is there but this game is in beta at best i put hundreds of hours into the original cs and this game is awful in comparison after 70 hours of trying to pull off builds everything is bugged nothing works as it should and theres just no fun to be had 

not only are we paying to beta test this for you youre releasing dlc instead of fixing this buggy mess shame on you for the scammy product shame on me for buying the ultimate edition

#####

to be upfront i have only reviewed this game now due to their first press release of the year i have complaints with the game  in general itself among other things but the biggest thing i cannot excuse is how the devs repaid their loyal customers cs1 was a near masterpiece and outside of good game development the devs were loyal and friendly to their customers cs was the only game i can think of for a long time where buying dlc while costly at times was hardly a second thought because it both added content and was repayment for how much respect we as customers had for them

cs2 totally flatfaced most of us i bought cs2 not too early after release and expected what something between what was written about it and what i saw in cs1 i quit playing 10 minutes in when my graphics were all over the place didnt work half the time and when they did i felt like they stepped down considerably from cs1 after a number of updates i played again after hearing its better quality wise my honest opinion on cs2 is its not only unfinished in many areas but in places the game has taken a one step forward two steps back approach like special industrial zones changing and how they did was nice but it felt off the mark in other places like with how unnatural the zones are and how not many people can even occupy that site as a job and of course cs is a traffic heavy game but cs2 traffic ai is beyond broken as even with perfect road design you will always see cars paralyzed by excessive yielding and cars wanting to turn into a turning lane so they can turn out of it at the next traffic light  and god help you if you dont yield to their wanton desires

overall theres a lot of stuff that should be in the game that isnt stuff from the old game that should be like what happened to designing intersections with stop signs in the game and buggy issues that have yet to be fixed and with a game so close to modders youd think day one thered be mod support there are mods right now that could be here on steam that have fixed a lot of the issues mentioned but arent here because the devs have spent their time doing whatever it is

at the end of the day i can at least move on and forgive knowing these devs since their track record with cs1 was great but since cs2 the devs have seriously not only let down their fans but outright betrayed them and now theyve gone full out blamegame by accusing the fans  their loyal customers  of being toxic they suggest just making honest critiques and making suggestions but then ban or delete anyone who makes them in the games related forums for being toxic i was originally waiting to see if they would fix more with the game before i left a review of any kind but after seeing this latest toxicity accusation against us i decided to join others whove left negative reviews in order to show the devs we dont appreciate being missled and gaslit about a game they should have had no issue releasing in the first place i will only swap my recommendation if they apologize and fix the game seriously from now on until then i will continue to play since i have the game but i will not buy anything else from this devs like dlc until they change their ways

its not ready yet let it cook

review update
i am now at 85 hours after learning the mechanics of how the simulations work i will admit my original review is influenced by not fully understanding some mechanics for instance the constant low density residential demand

aside from bugs rendering whole chunks of the game broken such as trade and garbage bugs after 85 hours the biggest issues i have with this game are twofold
1 an extreme lack of content building and farm diversity is extremely lacking i suspect content will be dlced to hell which i strongly oppose paradoxs dlc strategy of removing content to the bare bones and then selling it to players later

2 design decisions that just simply dont work or dont make sense for instance pegging wealth to education level wealth should be pegged to career instead how off map city services function also doesnt really work they work against the principle of building a healthy functioning city if you lack a service it doesnt negatively impact your game except that sims have a little less wealth as they pay for the off map service but thats easily countered by cheaper taxes standard genre features like the rci meter work differently to all previous city builders instead of showing what to build for a healthy city cs2 rci meter shows what the city wants which most likely doesnt result in a healthy city design changes away from genre standards are fine just make sure to include in game ways to let the player know what the change is from the genre standard

anyways after 85 hours my final conclusion stands i cannot recommend cities skylines 2 aside from performance and bugs the game has very little content and has design decisions that dont work or dont make sense


original review
i tried to like cs2 i really did i can ignore the performance issues and bugs as these are things i see being fixed over the short term with some patches in optimisation however there are much bigger issues that you need to be aware of the numerous simulations in the game have such foundational flaws in them that i believe this game is the most fake city builder of them all

this game is marketed as the most realistic city builder ever with multiple levels of simulation in the city sims economy services and traffic unfortunately there are huge flaws in each are of the simulation

after 20 hours playing aside from the known performance problems which ive mitigated by running the game at lower gfx than i should be these are the biggest issues i see

 the economy is broken goods in your city arent actually traded importexport dont actually do anything so trucks deliver goods to your stores and train stations ports and airports but the transportation networks never pick it up to deliver off map industry commercial and residential dont use your produced goods there is no cargo traffic in your city because there is no simulation of producing goods transporting them to your shops and then sims buying those goods its all completely fake colossal order have confirmed this on paradox forums

 the progression system is broken just place a tourist trap and bulldoze it repeat over and over level 20 without doing anything progression is not linked to population just xp gained from placing stuff thing is it doesnt remove the xp if you bulldoze straight away as a result you can have a flourishing metropolis with 50 people each main step should have a population limit ie town 10k city 50k metropolis 100k or something

 most people dont actually go to work kids dont go to school people dont shop you can track individual sims when you follow them they actually dont go to work they will get in their cars or walk to the tram or whatever jump on and then do a circuit back home or theyll arrive at work and get straight back onto transport again to come home kids do not leave the house they will stay in their homes not going to school the whole rush hour thing is a joke basically the sims simulation is fake and this is the big ticket item that this game is sold on a simulation of each individual sim going about their world doing what the do living growing prospering dieing all faked

 the city only ever demands low density housing never anything else city of 50k with very little office demand always low density residential will be 100 demand you can even buy 20 tiles do a massive grid of low density residential itll all pop into existence and demand will still be 100

 you dont need to build any city services it all comes in really cheaply from off map its cheaper to import all services than to build the services yourself and pay for maintenance the only exception seems to be power and water you can export power and water for enormous profits

 maintenance and expansion is not balanced at all for some buildings its cheaper per unit to build a new one and some are cheaper to just expand for instance water pump 10000 to build 100000 unit pump and 7000 to expand one an extra 50000 units cheaper to make a new one there

 the traffic ai is just absolutely stupid and retarded i couldnt think the traffic ai could be worse than cs1 but they actually managed to do it cars will do uturns in the middle of a highway cars will stop in the middle of the road jump across 3 lanes causing a big traffic jam just to reach a lefthand turn they go straight through instead opposing carriage turns ie right from left side drive left from right side drive will not wait till the approaching through traffic is clear they will turn like its the middle of delhi and cause a huge accident or traffic jam

 the economy is extremely frustrating there are no smalltown service buildings so to cater for your citizen demands you need to build service buildings priced for cities much larger than what you have this results in grinding your citys economy into the ground the only way around this is to largely ignore city services until at least 25k population when your tax revenue is starting to be enough to pay for these demanded services all the while the annoying bird building icons and radio announcements will continue harping on about all these citizen demands on the flip side electricity and water exports are priced so out of balance that building a few extra coal power plants and water pumps and exporting every single piece of it will have you swimming in money

 the whole off map servicing of your citizens is quite simply extremely flawed at its foundations when you utilise off map services the price of those services do not adjust to cater for the simple economic principle of supply and demand you can pump as much electricity to the off map as you can and the game will continue to give you the same high price for each mwh same with importing off map services using off map fire services will remain the extremely cheap price no matter how many fires they have to come and put out

 the garbage system is totally cactus your incinerators will go get garbage from off map to burn rather than burning your own your landfill fills up your buildings fill up and stupidly off map garbage trucks come and get your rubbish the only way to get around this is to build huge landfills and once they are full just bulldoze it poof all garbage gone since incinerators dont collect your garbage from landfills as its cheaper for them to drive off map and get it there its the only way to process landfill

tldr  optimisation issues aside there are major flaws in each of the games simulations the entire game presents a facade layered on top of fancy marketing speak i think in reality this game is the most fake city builder out of any of the toptier city builders in the 30 years ive been playing city builders ultimately i do not see how colossal orderparadox proceed from here

#####

i was looking forward to the launch so much was watching videos like a maniac and now i just havent touched the game since october its not ready at all it has

 perfomance issues
 non working economy
 traffic ai is worse than cs1
 no bikes 
 boring art style
 not a lot of assets

it basically has nothing to keep me entertained at this point i suspect the game will be probably enjoyable in a year from now i am super dissappointed with the game would not recommend anyone to buy it if you want a city painter go to cs1 if you want a transport type of city builder check out transport fever 2 theyre both better than cs2 at this point

#####

upd from january 13th apparently some people still look at this review and get upset by the fact that i played this game for 70 more hours after posting the review so let me clarify
i came back to the game at some point in december to check out their latest bugfixes in combination with the unofficial mods ive started a new city and built it up to about 30k population in those 70 hours unfortunately while some things got improved overall i still found the experience too frustrating in many areas so ive put it on the shelf again i will probably come back to give another go at some later time ago when more bugfixes and mods roll out

with 108 hours in and with a heavy heart i am putting this game on the virtual shelf
i was waiting for the release more than id waited for any game in the last 10 years cs1 along with civ6 was my main hobby for a decade 800 and 1000 hours spent on them respectively 
i have even invested in a new pc exclusively for cs2 rtx 4070 ryzen 7 5800x 32gb ram 
so im sure i should be counted among the hardcore fans of cs franchise 
with all that said i just cant play it in its current state heres a few reasons as to why listed in order of priority highest to lowest
  a lot of minor issuesbugs none of them game breaking but combined they result in a rather frustrating gaming experience
  some game mechanics are either not working properly or at least not transparent enough to make for good gameplay top example is income  i went up to 300mil on my city while being in the negative most of the time the tax income also fluctuates widely as do government subsidies
  very limited assets of course a lot more than vanilla cs1 had but a lot less than what im used to now in cs1 with all the steam workshop stuff and dlcs 
  no mods im also far too used to the amazing mods available in cs1 which enrich the experience sooo much and while cs2 indeed covers some of those mods in vanilla most of them are missing and playing without them just doesnt feel right

sooo whats next i will wait for the paradox workshop to go online and get filled up with a healthy supply of mods and assets by that time hopefully most of the issues will be addressed as well and maybe one or two dlcs will be out then ill give it another go 
and my recommendation to anyone contemplating a purchase just wait for all of the above things first thats what i would tell myself if i could time travel a month ago


#####

this is a paradox published game meaning that buying new will only spoil the experience youll have when devs actually finish developing the game give them a year or two to fix the game release a few dlcs that should have been included at launch and only then pick it up at a sale price
just play the original until then youll be a happier person


and yes i did play after the above review at least five hours of that was spent trying to coerce the game into running above 5fps luckily for me i have access to a 10000 workstation computer that still struggles to run this turd this is not a next gen game its a poorly optimized game or one they dont intend for people to play for another decade

#####

the game in its current state is not great aside from the performance issues that they are supposedly fixing the games core has some insane issues and almost completely ruins the experience for me 

1 none of the cims you see and the cars you see matter they are purely there for the visuals as the cims seem to mostly idle in home and aimlessly walk around they dont seem to really be connected to the games simulation aspect

2 the 1st point also applies to traffic jams and cargo trucks as they dont seem to impact the overall economy or anything like that in cs 1 whenever you would have a traffic jam especially in bigger cities you would notice a decline in your economy and would notice buildings and businesses not doing so well because of that in cs 2 none of that seems to matter as your citizens just dont care about a silly little traffic jam or car accidents or whatever

3 importing is free yes you heard me right importing is free or costs very little as they dont detail the costs anywhere i just have to assume its free based on how much my services cost even when importing everything

you can also import anything such as ambulances hearses fire trucks police cars and cargo this creates a massive problem where it feels like there is no point building clinics and fire stations and police stations the only reason to build a police station is to increase citizen happiness bc they for some reason dont like a high crime rate so at least there is something 
so this creates a massive problem where you can exploit the game as follows 

you can start up a city build your power plant and water stuff or import that too if you really want but these are about the only thing that costs money to import keep building commercial zones and residential zones and absolutely nothing else play on high speed and watch as your city grows to 3k pop in no time 

imagine spending all that time carefully placing hospitals police stations fire houses landfills and incineration plants or recycling centres if youre more green than me and trying to manage traffic just to then realise you dont even need to build them because they can just be imported and it costs you nothing and that traffic management is irrelevant to the simulation aspect of the game 

4 natural disasters dont really seem to have a massive impact if any at all i had an entire tornado go through my city for quite some time yet it only seemed to damage buildings because as soon as the tornado got off a specific building the building was suddenly 100 perfect and had no issues unless of course the tornado needs to sit in one spot its entire lifespan and only then will you see a building destroyed which is also impossible and stupid every other natural disaster doesnt really do much and im not even sure if ive discovered all of them because so far ive only seen forest fires and tornadoes

5 shops always have low customers even when you have a bunch of apartments and high density buildings around shops there still seems to be one or two shops that somehow have low customers which further proves that the citizens in the game just dont seem to be simulated its all being done in the background where you cant see it

theres also problems with low rent housing not even taking in any citizens when you first unlock it and it just ends up in the buildings being abandoned you bulldoze it it gets rebuilt and the cycle repeats

thats about it really ill update this review if anything changes but at the moment the game is extremely disappointing when you realise that the simulation game you just bought is only 20 simulated and the rest is purely visual and sometimes the visual is buggy and messed up i loved cities skylines 1 but this game at the moment is a joke

pls fix

bcities skylines iib was a very longawaited sequel to the most famous urlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp255710cities_skylinescities skylines iurl

h1what went wrongh1

turns out  ueverythingu
lets go over some simpler aspects of why this game failed at launch

olist
having multiple editions of the base game
now of course i am not saying that this is a bad thing if one really wants to support his favorite developer  he can freely do so by buying a higher edition of a game the problem came with the rewards  bat the time of writing this review people that have ordered said editions have not yet received their rewardsb
whenever you offer your game for multiple prices people have a set uexpectationu that you as a developer must match this was not shown by colossal order whatsoever

the game was announced in the march and released in boctoberb of the same year
of course some game companies tend to work on sequels undercover and announce them only after they deem it up to their standards ithis was not the case for cities skylines iii at launch  it was bvery and i mean veryb optimised i am gaming on 64gb of ram and a 3070 alongside a intel i710700k which is a pretty solid build result average of about 2030 fps on medium graphic settings on a settlement with about 15k people to also add salt on to the wound  game would frequently crash i am talking consistent crashes every 1520 minutes

not being able to receive backlash for a very bad release of the game
if you were like most and were of course not satisfied with the release of the game in such a state you would try to go and say it on the forums write reviews and ask developers questions as to how the fuck it is possible to release this junk what you receive a mute maybe a temporary ban for the time being for harassing the developers
now i understand we are human and being human means making mistakes but what the fuck you release a very bveryb underbaked game and then you decide to call everyone who doesnt like this garbage as harassers and demoralisers

mods
or  lack thereof recently read a post from oc its the 9th oc post and inside and i quote  
quotecolossal order ltdpublic beta version of code modding and paradox mods will be available in the live build by the end of march
public beta version of map editing available in the live build together with code modding or soon after
public beta version of asset editing to be announced only after the technical issues are sorted can we roll out the toolquote

so let me get this straight you release a halfbaked game  with no modding support  until a year later 
and of course people got mad rightfully so

problems bugs and many core features missing
of course of course what did you expect a paradox game having a good launch phaha dont make me laugh both of us know that this will persist until colossal order will start making bdlcsb which not only paywall the original core features but also do the damned bug fixes
olist

h1final reviewh1

at the state the game is currently  i doubt it is worth your time you could spend the time you have on something more useful or a game that is more fun if you breallyb enjoy citybuilders and want to do something in them then you can buy this game

my review about i35 out of 10i
if you want to buy it wait for a sale presumably a 50 or 60 off as i do not think you are getting your moneys worth at the time of me writing this

#####

in its current state the game cannot be run to a playable level past 100000 population for 98 of steam users 

this needs 36 months of optimisations to run correctly and thats ignoring all the bugs and exploits

#####

they lied about the detailed simulation

they have admitted that there are failsafes to stop the city collapsing if the city can not fail it is a city painter not a simulation

#####

after 1000 enjoyable hours on the first cities skylines game the announcement trailer for this cities skylines ii made me very excited to start playing this game at the same time the trailer set high expectations and promised to be the ultimate city builder game 

a big part of my review will be about my findings in contrast to the previous game

on startup you will immediately notice an improvement in graphics and user interface i find this a very nice and welcome update landscapes weather buildings cars and roads all look so much better now also buildings look a lot more varied and zoning has been expanded with the same zoning types as before but various new densities the refreshed road tools are definitely one of my favorite updates roads look better especially connections and intersections and theyre easier to build too services got better with upgradeable service buildings which add features or capacity at the cost of some increased monthly upkeep you can use development points which you earn by reaching milestones to unlock services or service buildings i think this adds a new layer to how you build and manage your city and what you prioritize

overall the gameplay has had big improvements and definitely feels more advanced i enjoy playing this game and can only be positive about the added features however this game is not finished the amount of bugs and issues have cast a shadow over all the positive new additions the biggest issue by far is the performance whereas in cities skylines 1 i had no problem running cities with a population of 1m cities skylines ii becomes unplayable before reaching 100k on the same rig intel i5 6600k  nvidia gtx 1070  32gb ram its an 8 year old computer but still runs most other games just fine its frustrating how the goal of this game to build a fully functioning city is so limited because of the insane hardware requirements necessary to play and enjoy this game to its full potential i can start a new game and play it for a few days after which the simulation becomes so slow its not playable anymore the challenge and fun about this game is supposed to be to keep expanding and managing your city but thats taken away because of the poor performance besides this without a doubt biggest flaw there are countless other bugs that cause frustration among all players with more bugs being found and reported all the time there are problems with the new traffic ai which was announced to get refined but now turns out to be worse than before with traffic changing lanes right before an intersection and causing big traffic jams as a result same for public transportation vehicles instead of fixing traffic they cause big congestions and standstill traffic anyone that played cities skylines before knows that traffic can cause all kinds of problems throughout the city and it got arguably worse with this update furthermore theres a big instability in the economies with players suddenly losing lots of money for no reason at all a big part of the previous game that were still hoping to get in this new game soon is the addition of custom assets and mods these could help improve the game by a lot and would again be a very welcome addition to cities skylines ii 

there are plenty of other bugs and issues impacting the experience of playing this game too many to keep mentioning but i believe it proves how not ready this game was for getting released the game got published as a finished product not as a beta version the game were playing now even 4 months after release does not feel like a finished and stable game thats why the backlash has been huge and its for good reasons being called out by the ceo of colossal order as a toxic community in response to the negative feedback which aims to help the developers improve the game is just another flaw in the reputation of the game and the publishers

all things considered its a promising but not yet finished game paying 50 seems overpriced for what you get at this point in time i would actually recommend buying the first game since it is finished and much more able to keep expanding your cities so no i cant recommend this game in the state its in right now its frustrating to play and impossible to play as it was intended thanks for reading i hope this was useful for someone

tldr promising but far from finished game not worth spending 50 yet needs a lot of changes patches and updates to become actually playable

#####

save your money and wait for a sale  in 6 months dont spend time trying to get it to work because you cant get a refund if youve been in the game more than two hours the negative reviews about performance you see are accurate even if your hardware is more than adequate this game should have had another few months of qa before release

#####

at its current state no i wouldnt recommend it
the game is full of bugs bad performance and the biggest part of its problem is the lack of content 
it becomes boring very fast i was happy when it was released and could start seriously a real city without interruption and progress through the game slowly but surely

i burnt out quickly the game is boring the game ceo is shitting on us and trolling us like we didnt pay for this game
if you dont like the game this isnt for you this is a major middle finger towards the community 
what responsible answer is that  are we 5  
fix the damn game and listen to your community 

i am still hopeful tho 


#####

setting aside graphics performance at launch which is terrible cities skylines 2 is a deeply broken city simulation game

to be more precise it doesnt actually simulate a city in any meaningful way and its barely a game

the economy and various systems are all fake smoke and mirrors to give you an illusion of control and choice dont build a garbage dump garbage will be automatically trucked out of your city on its own by magic fail to have commercial or industry the city just works

the much improved traffic ai they claimed would eliminate the first games traffic problems it just makes cars teleport to their destination if theyre being too slow

these are a just a few examples but every single thing they claim is being simulated isnt its all incredibly shallow and fake and falls apart with more than a surface inspection in terms if city management simulation and city designing it is several steps backwards from the first cities skylines in every way

it is completely unsatisfying to play

#####

release workshop so modders can fix your game ffs it is clear you want to farm dlc first

#####

this game has received a crazy amount of negative reviews due to the poor performance which is justified however this seems to be primarily due to a bugged depth of field quality

this is with everything else on medium quality
depth of field quality on high  21 fps
depth of field quality on low  78 fps
depth of field quality disabled  132 fps

game itself is otherwise great so if you just disable dof you should be fine and the game is worth it

#####

if you want to pay full price to participate in an early beta test so you can use the improved road tools and mixed use residentialcommercial zoning then this is your game the headlines point to the many performance problems the game has but there are numerous bugs in the simulator and in the gameplay as well a lot of smaller bugs can be overlooked as the game is playablebut as you progressively expand your city you realize that the economy is not working properly chiefly importexport and garbage does not work properly eitherwhich makes developing any serious strategy pointless since the balance may get thrown completely off when bugs get fixed

colossal order did an awesome job bringing us the first cities skylines but i dont think we should reward them or especially their publisher paradox for failing to finish the game before full release right now this is a broken game and it should have had a much larger and longer beta testby months at least wait until modders can come in and fix what the developers havent gotten to as even some of their design decisions were silly toolike not allowing us to turn off the weather

#####

half a year has passed since the games release

ive been patiently hoping colossal would fix their game and didnt request a refund when i had the chance that was a mistake several months in they still havent fixed glaring optimization issues or their simulation engine opening the game to see 20 fps in the main menu or on an entirely empty map on 3080ti was a very special experience

since then in response to welldeserved constructive criticism regarding the game the developer just showed their belligerence and tried to wrap it as playerbases toxicity instead of fixing their barely functioning game or coming up with excuses in line with if you want better performance our game might not be for you

stay away from this game it was released in an alpha state and has not been fixed ever since instead their resources went towards paid dlc content

the ceo is a joke
constantly blaming the player base for beeing toxic
you are scammers not more not less you over and false advertised your game and delivered a not working piece of junk
and still you dont get why people are upset
we worked so hard yes and still you managed to deliver shit congrats

normaly i wouldnt write any comment on that and just carry on but the rly annoying behavior of the ceo since release trying to set themselfs as victims here is unaccaptable i loved cs1 but cs2 is nothing more than a scamsadly

#####

im sorry but such a basic feature like exporting cargo being bugged for weeks is unacceptable

#####

sadly this review is negative 

the performance is just unacceptable there are some rendering issues plaguing the game and on top of that there are some wildly unoptimized assets in this game

from small guard shacks with modeled out wires computers and keyboards to the horrendous looking procedural generated citizens that far exceed even some larger buildings in triangle count they are a waste of computer resources

the whole unecessary addition of a citizen lifepath is something very few players asked for and its clear part of the issues with this game relate to choises made during development of the game 

the truth is these citizen models look so hideous that they dont even invite you to engage with the lifepath mechanic at all id rather have they were significantly reduced in detail or replaced by assets modeled by an actual artist and not a procgen program before i would consider paying attention to the lifepath stuff this game offers

i wanted to love this game and in a way i still do everything else cities skylines 1 did is improved in 2 but the terrible performance and questionable looking assets really ruin the hype for me 

also this game has a launcher and just like the 1st game its totally unnecessary and offers no utility whatsoever beyond serving advertisements to you for nvidia

this review might change to positive if the optimisation is adressed in the future and the ability to mod the horrendous looking potatoheads is added before then if you are not brand loyalist like me stick to the first game a while longer this game needs a couple more months in the oven

edit further thoughts

after longer play a noticeable issue is that residential zoning demand is based on density not on affordability

wealth does not factor much in where a citizen will move in as much as density type does

this results in the player having to build an insane amount of low density zoning even though denser apartment building types would be preferred and more efficient limiting your planning abilities and creativity

the game will complain about there being a housing crisis when the real problem is that citizens will not move into denser buildings 

city policies are negligible and can no longer be applied globally instead having to be set per district 

building upgrades are a great mechanic however 

virtual texturingtexture streaming seems to struggle with alpha mapped objects primarily hedges causing them to look cubical with flat 2d planes sticking out of them this happens even with less performance intensive cities

i really want to recommend this game but even ignoring the performance issues which are being patched and have improved there are just too many basic bugs to justify buying at this price at this time
im sure the devs are not happy with the amount of negative reviews and as someone who works in software development i suspect it is a management push to hit a deadline regardless of quality that has hurt this game
there are just too many fundamental things that are wrong only some of which have been fixed eg commercial zoning has only just been fixed was completely unbalanced with no shoppers regardless of population garbage trucks clone garbage instead of incinerating it leading to massive backlogs hydro electric power plain doesnt work at all
the release should have been delayed until the game was actually working they knew performance was an issue and they must have known there was a massive list of fundamental bugs what should have been a well received game by an existing fan base is now just annoying and alienating and most former fans have lost all faith in colossal i certainly wont buy another of their games at release and for full price
 im sure this will be a great game at some point but that point is not now we know there are some issues is no excuse for releasing what you know is a buggy poor performing mess of a game and expecting people to pay full price for it

#####

youll get my money once the game is ready to be released

#####

sadly the game isnt ready for release hold off for now  ill be happy when the time comes to change this review

the game performs horribly and on the settings that allow it to scrape by with 20 fps it looks dramatically worse than cities 1 there are also various bugs especially around not enough customers that fill the game with annoying bubble alerts for no reason

#####

im gonna try to be genuinely honest here the situation for the game is pretty nuanced and that can be difficult to express in a time when everything needs to be a meme andor the worstbest thing to ever happen in short you can buy the game right now and have a heck of a lot of fun but the game might have gotten off to a better initial reception had it been delayed for another 6 months or so

pros the game is a lot of fun at this stage and i am so happy we already get to play it whenever we want

1 what is here now is definitely enough to call this a full release

2 you can do a lot and you have much better tools out the gate compared to the first game its less finicky while also more powerful so its a heck of a lot easier to reach a higher baseline of coollooking cities cant overstate how much of an evolution this is examples road tool is insane zoning and the way assets are categorized gives you much more control as well as more types of zoning

3 performance issues aside the game is an insane visual upgrade the game can look frankly shockingly impressive this ties into the first point to make cities betterlooking by default in the first youd need several mods to start making cool cities not here 

4 the simulation is really hecking cool there are some bugs but in general the way the city works with individually simulated agents makes for a city that has sort of its own life independent of your decisions  all of a sudden you might notice a lot of people have educated themselves and consequently want different places to work and live so you now have a bunch of other options to build different stuff cool so it needs a little bit of work but its absolutely mostly there

5 since everything is simulated traffic is a lot better mostly youre fine and at rush hour you get some backup thats pretty much it now


cons there are pretty good arguments it could have been a delayed for like 6 months or b released as an early access product

1 quite a lot of small bugs whether its education being unbalanced commercial having weird importexport stuff or garbage being handled oddly theres stuff in the simulation that isnt working as intended or is in need of further balancing most of the stuff is simply down to not having played the game enough before to notice or not having enough time to fix it i guess its annoying if you sit and think about it but not a single one of the bugs have really bothered me in a meaningful way

2 performance is bad but colossal order have been very upfront about that from before the game was released some of the reporting on it postrelease however makes it seem like they just didnt have enough time to finish all the work for instance the reports on wild amounts of polygons being rendered the acknowledge moreorless by colossal order about lod work simply not being finished or the broken effects you pretty much need to turn some of them off you can absolutely run the game  just check out the posted performance guides on which effects to turn off 

3 compared to a very kitted up cities skylines 1 with all dlc and mods you might feel a little restricted if youve played it a lot youll come across situations where you go what a great spot this would be for a custom park or whatever feature from the first games 10year life cycle if youve never played that version of the first game you might come across situations where youre like so i just build more of mostly the same type of district andboth yes and no there is some challenge to be creative but on the other hand that forces you to familiarize yourself with the tools at hand to get the most creativity out of what is here your mileage may vary

4 bluntly some things just make it seem like the game is like 34 finished why are there no unlocks past the halfway point of the development roadmap small citybig city etc room for future expansions or planned but cut features who knows dont get me wrong these are nonessential things but the feeling is there after almost 70 hours in the game

taken as it is you could argue they shouldve delayed 6 months or released into early access instead but you can also argue that releasing it will ultimately make the game much better much faster by both a making the developers accountable to the players rather than some arbitrary release date and b giving them more feedback than they could ever need to improve the game is it a little cynical maybe did they coldly calculate that the shortterm reputation loss would be offset by the longerterm improvements of both what the bottom line looks like for the fiscal quarter as well as the game itself also maybe but dont they have a right to do that and do we need to be maximally dramatic about it if that is what they decide to do looking at it coolly it is a complicated situation for a company and either way they would have gone there would have been pros and cons i wont presume id know so perfectly well what would be the right thing to do for players employees publisher and the company itself

furthermore you could argue that the early access label brings with it certain connotations  a neverending cycle of waiting for when the game is no longer almost finished and developers who just abuse the concept to avoid accountability or expectations of quality also is it maybe not allowed to release something as early access when its already been marketed as a full release sort of thing heck if i know  im not a lawyer

to sum it up issues notwithstanding im super glad im playing the game now rather than in 6 months im glad i get to play it in a state where i can expect what is there to be enough for a release and dont have to think about whats a month or two down the line as for the rest of it i might feel a way about it but ultimately ill leave up to colossal order because its their product in the end

#####

releasing unfinished game  no recommendation

#####

who would imagine that we would get another unoptimized mess of a game in 2023 i am tired boss

#####

bupdate after the recent update i have been able to play this game at least now i can adjust some settings to high however the city in my savegame is very small with 2k cims so i dont know for how much long it will stay stable stuttering isnt gone but now its definitely not as frequent as it was but maybe its because the city is very small only time stuttering keeps happening noticeably is when loading a save game after launching the game which probably means game takes time to load textures nevertheless the number of issues that occurred after the release shouldnt have happen in a full released game b

this review will probably not get any attention paradox or co probably will not even notice this review or may not even bother at all in fact probably no one will notice this review among hundreds but ill share my honest feelings about the game anyway

i do not have thousands of hours of gameplay on cs1 but i did enjoy playing it a lot ive used tons of mods to make my cities look cool even though i have not been playing cs1 recently i was actually excited for cs2 bought the standard and then refunded to buy the ultimate edition because i was sure i would love it so why not get the entire package

i saw videos popping up claiming bad performances of cs2 i became skeptical but i still hoped that i would be happy just to go with some medium and low settings i just wanted to have fun

turns out im just another idiot who really believed paradoxco and prepurchased this game despite the warnings having a 9900k running at 47ghz a rtx 3060 ti and 32gb ram running at 3600mhz with 1080p display seems to be not even close enough to enjoy this game even with lowmedium graphics that i had hoped 

i keep seeing reviews and comments from people claiming they are getting better performances with similar hardware i keep adjusting my settings according to their comments and i do see an increase in fps but even after tweaking my settings to mostly low my game keeps heavily stuttering way too frequently i keep wondering how people who have similar hardware like mine are playing this game and managing to build their city while my city is just at the start with no cims because im struggling to manage the stuttering 

most of my play hours consist of fiddling with the settings and seeing how the game performs i could not manage to even get a city going because the stuttering wouldnt make it possible for me to play it

people at paradox or co whoever is responsible for this disaster how can you release a game with such an unoptimized state and then claim that this game was meant for future hardware in mind like even your recommended hardware struggles with higher settings

i paid to play a game so i could enjoy it since my hardware at least meets the minimum standards i dont mind the lack of a steam workshop i dont mind that the game would probably look uglier and i lowered my expectations seeing all the negativity and now my rig struggles to run it even with lower settings i did not pay you to get a product that i would be spending time with to adjust the settings and be disappointed every time

if anyone at paradox or co actually sees this review i kindly ask you to stop releasing your game in such a messy state yes you admitted that the performance did not meet your expectations but instead of postponing the release you let this trainwreck happen im sorry if i sound bashful but we all paid real money during these hard times to buy your product and all we got was disappointment

#####

everyone already knows the performance is terrible so ill just share my experience so you have a further example to compare to
i have a 13900k 64gb of ram and a rtx 4090 playing on a 1440p ultrawide monitor
i got 35 fps at the main menu and in game on a brand new map wo building a single thing
turning off motion blur and depth field increased this from 35 to 50 fps

not a single other graphics setting changed the performance at all
i turned off every single setting i could or set it to the lowest possible and still only got 50 fps

this is impressively bad optimization i actually cant recall another game recently where changing the graphics settings literally did nothing to fps  just stay away from this until they fix it

#####

3060ti runs at 94 with a bare city models of rci arent loading game keeps forcing itself minimized into the taskbar sigh i was really looking forward to this

#####

you dont get sympathy points for warning people the game is a unoptimized mess you delay it until you are sure your playerbase can actually play it

#####

for anyone who thinks buying the game and leaving a negative review will get the attention of the publisher thats delusional the game may have mixed reviews but there are also nearly 19k of them all that shows is the game has a strong engagement and they know customers will wait patiently for them to fix it after they already have your money 

if anyone is actually interested in putting a stop to the anti consumer crap these publishers routinely do you have to refund or not purchase the game at all its common sense thats the only thing they will notice to be clear most of these issues stem from the publisher wanting to get paid not the development team the time frame these games are expected to be released in is not realistic anymore

quoteh1video version httpsyoutubeazawiwsly
written version belowh1quote

cities skylines 2 should not be released it pains me to say as a big fan of the original game but the sequel here is simply not in an acceptable state

bnote trimmed to fit steam check video for full versionb

so basically paradox sent me a copy of the game  thanks to the for that by the way  and given how many hours i have poured into the original i went into this one super excited i booted up the game and was immediately met by a 5 fps main menu not 60 not 30 but just 5 i figured okay ill change some settings around to see what i can get to work the devs sent me their recommended graphics settings so i swapped to those and managed to get the main menu to roughly 70 fps

this was great until i hopped into the actual game and it wasnt after just an hour of gameplay that 70 fps deteriorated all the way down to 30 after two hours it was down to 1520 with my population not even hitting 10000 yet i was playing at 1440p on a mix of mostly low and some medium settings my system specs are above the recommended requirements even after they were raised a few weeks ago which was already a massive red flag to begin with

the performance is just abysmal i can see maybe 30 fps being fine but the fact that the game frequently dips to half of that on almost the lowest settings is just unacceptable it makes the experience feel slow choppy and frustrating its not even like the game itself is bad from what i have played it has been a solid upgrade to what i loved about the first game its just that those upgrades are marred by some of the worst performance i have seen from a pc release all year

ive seen others concerned with the change of modding platforms  from steam workshop to paradoxs own mod platform  but honestly that doesnt bother me so much the performance is all that really matters at this point and i cannot in good faith give the game a proper review until it is optimized that might take months maybe longer

h2overallh2
i cannot recommend cities skylines 2 its almost unplayable in its current state and the fact that it is being released anyways is really just sad the publisher knows the game isnt ready and that really just rubs me the wrong way maybe good for business but bad for the consumer and that is ultimately who i always will side with

im too lazy firing my wood stove so i got this to heat the room with 900 watts

#####

unfortunately the discussion about the performance covers the real problems of this game
1 no animations children do not play on playgrounds you do not see the firefighters work nobody is swimming in the pool  only to mention 3 pieces

2 wrong information the info screen for the individual people is simply wrong 2 year old ceos of companies chippings that are completely wrong how can there be tweets if i have 0 inhabitants

3 import  export is not working how can you reliably import and export goods right you cant it is not working

4 industry specialization is bugged when you place woods specialization a lot of non wood related industries are built right next to my forrester and the wood industry is built on the other side of the map 

5 the graphics is awful for a game released in 2023 i mean compare it to anno1800 and you will notice that cities2 just looks really really bad

6 overall performance something is fundamentally wrong with your way of implementing unity on an empty map i have less than 60fps with a ryzen 5800x radeon 7900xtx and 64 gib ram playing in 3440x1440 additionally my gpu is constantly at 100 while the clcpu is around 1020 while you write the game is cpu intensive
how to resolve
1 implement animations to everything crowded sidewalks and playing children in the parks is what we want

2 correct the information screens and fix chirper

3 fix importexport to work properly

4 when a specialized industry field is built we need a system that lows us to build the respective industry right next to it

5 improve alle textures and out more love into all assets everything looks too clean

6 rethink your whole assumption of 30fps goal the game has to work at 144fps in 3440x1440p until we reach a certain amount of inhabitantslets say 500k

until these points are fixed i cannot recommend this game to anyone

big fan of cities skylines 1 but always wanted that something extra cities skylines 2 was supposed to be it i watched several videos on it for popular content creators and have been excited to play it since it was announced i bought this after the recent performance update as my pc is only decent and not topoftherange and still with most settings disabled or on the lowest possible the game runs so poorly this is to the point where it feels like im playing a poly game where i cant even reliably place anything bad bad frame rate constant stuttering its so bad that even the speed up time feature on max takes forever to progress its hard to judge the details within the game while playing with this but from the small city i have built i have noticed a few issues with the game itself
95 low density residential demand
public transport bus not being used
unreliable information on import and export of material power water etc
not much traffic traffic management is one of my favourite parts about the game but this may be due to my low settings
and more
i have high hopes for the potential of this game but for now i will be playing cities skylines 1 until i see an update where i can actually play the game instead of watching a slow stuttery slideshow

#####

we got on and off ramps and all we had to sacrifice for were our fps

found a solution for the moment though

h3performance parth3

went from 15 fps with massive stutters while everything on high to 60 fps with only occasional stutters through bsetting dynamic resolution to constantb dont set it to dynamic messes with the anti aliasing a bit though but could be worse

additionally you can bchange the anti aliasing method to taab under the advanced tab top right bto get rid of the messy edgesb introduced this way game gets a bit more blurry but its ok

furthermore you can increase the minimum resolution percentage scale to values above 50 and together with taa the game looks decent

if it looks super blurry you need to lower the overall graphics quality and try again

h3review parth3 

having played for about 7 hours and loving the game so far new street building tools are great as they have incorporated some of my favorite mods from cities 1 i love that they added modular buildings as well as new zone types that let you combine commercial and residential districts and there has been a lot of improvement regarding attention to detail for example if several cars are driving behind one another at night only the first car uses their high beams which i think is neat i also like the addition of a research tree 

have fun i hope this helps and you guys can enjoy the game as much as i do after the initial hassle to get it running 

#####

absolutely cannot recommend the game in its current state and im incredibly disappointed to have to admit that as this was something that ive been looking forward to for most of the year horrendous performance issues aside the fact remains that the simulation does not exist as advertised there is virtually no challenge you can have garbage overflowing in the streets high crime low healthcare bad traffic and you will still make money and see a city that is clean happy and flourishing after a mere 10 hours i became demotivated to play as i felt that there was no point especially combined with how poorly the game ran in the first place 

blows my mind that we had better animations and player feedback in a city builder which was released 20 years ago in cs ii you can paint a nice looking city with cool interchanges but no real detailing tools no assets to plop aside from trees so even if you prefer city painting over city simulation youll eventually be left feeling pretty bored 

i hope that these things along with the performance issues are addressed i really do but even if they are and cs ii eventually becomes the product that co  paradox told us it was it will likely be at the very least a year or two until that happens do not buy do not support these shady business practices

nobody can afford rent and theres to much traffic so realistic

#####

a potentially great game which is hampered by issues with simulation glitches and lack of key features that should have been available from day 1 i still recommend the game as there is no mixedmiddle ground option as long as one is aware of the games shortcomings

gameplay
most features from base cs1 are back together with a mixture of the old dlc content and even mods and some new great features of its own there is a ton of content available and this is where the game shines

building things is much more pleasant in this game than in cs1 no forced roadside requirement roads and tracks can intersect multiple other roadstracks upgrading and adjusting roads is much easier electricity and water are automatically transported via roads adjusting intersections a la tmpe is a breeze roads and tracks can be freely connected to city neighbors out of bounds intercity lines are now at the players discretion

buildings can be upgraded via modules a nice addition and one that quite likely allow for quite a bit of customization later on when mods are allowed  ie expandable train stations building scale is overall improved relative to the first game though airports are still horribly undersized

maps are bigger though like in cs1 only a fraction of it is available to the player without mods and even then there are limits on the number of tiles you can buy this is a drawback in my opinion and at the very least the available area that can be bought should be fully available if not the rest of the map

simulation
a mixed bag for me in one hand traffic is more random and when it works is more pleasant to watch in my opinion there are nice new touches like seasons  though more control over them is desired  and traffic accidents 

in the other hand the simulation is very slow and things take long to progress even at the fastest simulation speeds furthermore ai vehicles leave a lot to be desired in many circumstances for example near highway ramps where they tend to all try to merge into the highway instead of exiting at the very last second causing huge backups along the way

another key issue for is the separation of residential demand into lowmediumhigh density as a sandbox game the choice of density should be left at players discretion especially when commercial and office buildings are not affected by this in the current state that the game is there is way too much low residential demand that never seems to end forcing one to build swaths of suburbia even if some or all can be replaced at later stages in the game

graphics
i quite like the direction of where the game is visually going however the execution is poor in that visuals are quite grainy and pixelated and can look downright horrible at certain angles and distances even on the highest graphical settings with a good gpu

sound
the radio with a mix of generic relaxing music intersped with newcasts and talkshows discussing minutiae in and of your city is back music is ok but bland and overall rather limited in which it becomes repetitive pretty quickly personally i listen to something else in the background instead

other issues
at the moment there is no official modding support or a map editor included and there is not a big variety of maps to begin with in the base game  only a dozen or so there are already mods being developed and released in thirdparty platforms however

furthermore even when modding support does come in 2024 it will be limited to the paradox servers and there will be no steam workshop support

also the game may suffer from occasional to frequent crashes to the desktop so make sure to enable autosave which comes disabled by default and is a source of grief to many people in the forums or at least save manually often

summary
cities skylines 2 is a game that has a lot of potential but suffers from a rushed release updates will likely rectify many of the issues and the review will be reedited accordingly in the state that the game is now and its price i think is a decent game and one that is quite entertaining if it runs right but nowhere near its potential 610

dec 1st 2023 edit reduced my rating from 7 to 6 due to finding out no official steam workshop too frequent crashes at times and quickly dwindling performance in very large cities

#####

it sucks its not just performance issue but from a gameplayvisual standpoint its a traffic sim it calls itself a realistic simulation but its lifeless your cims dont do anything but drive and dissapear around the map the follow feature is useless kids dont go to school there are no bikes 0 animations even for firefighterscopsambulance the ai is still p terrible at pathfinding the lack of assets on buildings especially later on economy is broken you can beat the game by just putting on geothermal powerplant and you make a 10k profit capped at 1 million income 

as a fan of city builders skylines 2 is def one of the worst games ive played just coz 1 was bad on launch doesnt make it right for 2 to launch in this state with upcoming dlc already planned fix the game first

dont bother picking this up just keep playing 1 until 8 years when it comes out of pre alpha

#####

this game has got to be the biggest disappointment this year full release is actually a beta the mechanics are purely for show industry does not deliver goods to commercial goods magically appear bare bones version without any steam workshop support

they should have release this game with cities skylines 1 dlc already in the base game they are pulling an ea the sims where everything will be released as 30 dlcs totally over 300

colossal order also has the most arrogant ceo mariina hallikainen maybe this game isnt for you after being called out on how broken this game is

do not buy

b  4 worrying pr news posted wed october 25  100am b 

i cities skylines ii is built for the future with modern hardware in mind allowing us to add more depth and detail to the game than its predecessor had i 

 4090  i9 setup is obsolete nowadays


i  if you experience low fps we recommend the following

    reduce screen resolution to 1080p
    disable depth of field and volumetrics
    reduce global illumination
    check the full guide for more tips i

 because 1080 on a 4090 i9 setup is the future


i it is worth mentioning that for a game like this the performance target is to run at a steady 30fps minimum there is no real benefit in a city builder to aim for higher fps  i

 sure pan the camera around a bit and see how you like this peek at the future at 30 fps

i while some setups on pc have challenges we concluded the performance is not a dealbreaker for all the players i 

 and they were right some people are playing in 1080p with the graphics turned down and theyre completely fine with that please do note that i9  4090 is one of those setups that have challenges

update on march 11
its been 5 months since the release and the mod support is still in the works i cannot emphasize enough how badly co played their cards and all that expectation hype momentum whatever has definitely died down gj co and maybe i should check back in a year from now

update on nov 1
 radio is kinda boring and theres limited track list even worse the hosts give you straight up false info power outage no more water etc
 same thing with the chirpy
 again traffic ai is dumb sometimes they straight up ignore your signage sometimes they just do the weirdest thing on the road blocking the entire street case in point urlhttpswwwredditcomrcitiesskylinescomments17l6sfuradio_traffic_sucks_today_meanwhile_cims_hold_mysee thisurl


update on oct 29

i have a 6950xt and 12900k my profile has not updated to reflect this sorry if that confused you

 if you are like me who hated the new white reflectiontorn effect on the roads do the following
 enable developer mode by adding developermode to your launch options
 load up a game and press tab
 on gamerending  shaders disable bhdecalscurveddecaldeterioration
credit to rev0 for this

 the performance problem seems to be subsided after experimenting with the graphics settings i have now 40fps now but its only a 20k pop town so will see how things scales random stuttering still occurs

 traffic ai is actually kinda bad and borderline funny erratic lane merging getting stuck on a roundabout or 5point uturn on a street was often observed

 i studied some issues in the game economy and the solutions are uh quite not what i expected for example for the not enough customers issue it was advised to tear down its neighboring businesses until you roll into a biz that happened to use what that shop is selling for example you can have a food company with not enough customers and you should keep demolishing its neighbors till you get a restaurant company that turns food into meal problem solved or is it

 likewise rent too high issue is because my citizens are lacking education etc to find a job to afford the rent despite i have a number of schools all the way from elementary to college i built buses to facilitate transit nope still not enough people literally are broke they cant even afford low rent housing guess the game is telling me i need ubi in the city

and before you asked yes the game does feel like an upgrade from the first iteration with many much needed changes and qol improvements however i do have high expectations from the co and i hope these issues are rectified before i can wholeheartedly recommend the game

do i like the game yes but only because i loved csl 1 do i recommend it at this stage to anyone no



i really really really wanted to like it  but the game could use much needed improvements right now
 
issues includes the following
1 performance the latest 1011 patch did enable 80fps in the main menu but in game its still around 2030fps worse still the game now is stuttering very bad when i pan the camera which didnt happen with the original release this made the game literally unplayable for me post update

2 tutorial could be made better and more accessible as of now it doesnt cover basics well enough and as a csl1 player i got confused with some aspects still 

3 rent too high not enough customers buildings getting abandoned i have no clue how to solve them and the game isnt exactly telling me how to solve them either

4 bugs especially how terrain and buildingsroads interact can be funny

5 not mod ready still 

i will come back and revise this review should anything improves

#####

 horrible performance
 no variety in terms of assets mostly buildings
 no mod support
 progression seems odd
 balance issues economy broken education broken import  export broken
 lots of graphic bugs clipping flickering
 traffic ai stupid
 zoning system also stupid af
 cant turn off winter it sucks

#####

if you like city sim games then this is an obvious choice however seeing as this is a paradox game i would suggest waiting a few patches or possibly for a sale you are going to be spending 100150euro over the years on dlc anyway

#####

this has been a very painful game to play coming from cs1 cs2 felt incredibly draining my main issue with it aside from performance which for me was playable is the amount of low density residential demand there is out of the 11 hours i have played i would say 9 were dedicated purely to building low density residential i though it would be good that there would be different types of residential demand but when even after unlocking high density residential i only ever get to play low density this would make your cities have a tiny center and a massive sea of single family houses surrounding it the grid is another thing i have a problem with it is incredibly easy to break the grid this might not seem like a big deal but it means that it is stupidly hard to get your building to line up even if the road is straight it is especially noticeable with row housing my final issue is with the sizes of the assets the assets are gorgeous and incredibly detailed but they are massive an elementary school would take up at least an entire block and a cemetery although beautiful took up 2 city blocks in my city also assets keep repeating themselves over and over there is barely any variety and the assets that do exists especially for residential are incredibly drab and sad i understand that the game is meant to simulate reality but there has to be a balance because the game looks so gray and depressing my final complaints is that theres no bikes on a city sim game i would expect there to be the most popular modes of transportation at least it also feel weird that features available in cs1 are completely absent in cs2 apart from bikes theres no way to control which streets get zoning theres barely any vegetation selection not a single palm tree no quays no canals etc
i hate the game in its current state it has a ton of potential and i hope that it feels complete soon but right now it feels like a beta i wish i had waited another year to buy this game because after i finish writing this review im going to go back to playing cs1 until this game no longer feels like a beta

#####

one of the most expensive powerpoint presentations ive ever bought

#####

great new benchmarking software

#####

never preorder never ever preorder

#####

the novelty of the experience has dissipated and the enjoyment in engaging with this game has waned i have acquired a comprehensive understanding of the simulation if one could generously term it as such frankly this game appears to be a substantial misrepresentation even in light of recent updates upon reviewing the weekly developer videos one is left to ponder whether they were addressing an entirely different game it strains credulity that any of the developers have successfully managed a city exceeding 100k in population below i enumerate a series of grievances

cargo possesses the ability to teleport indiscriminately from one location to another obviating the necessity for any form of vehicular transport

absence of toggleable zoning on roads a manifestation i classify as a bug

the statistics panelmenu displays only half of the chart

canines are inexplicably abandoned when a simulated entity utilizes public transportation to a destination beyond the city limits

frequent crashes to the desktop occurring approximately every three hours

influxes of taxis originating from external locales converging on an arbitrary point idling and subsequently departing the city via ostensibly the most inconvenient route characterized by its protracted duration or sluggish pace

occasional inexplicable surges in the waiting on a hearse phenomenon without corresponding spikes in statistical data

inoperative post and mail sorting systems

hospitals and clinics perennially devoid of medical supplies resulting in diminished efficiency

inexplicable preference for exporting over support for local businesses

persistent pollution of water bodies unaffected by the passage of a decade despite strong water flow

shifts in wind direction notably the barrier island experiencing inland winds leading to the dispersal of pollution over the city

discordance between chirps ingame messages and actual occurrences within the city

the need to mute the radio after 25 minutes due to its repetitive nature devoid of relevance to the citys development

paradoxically the game operates at its maximum efficiency on the 1x speed setting while higher settings result in slowdowns rather than acceleration ie 05 or 02

the inability to sustain a 15minute simulation run before encountering graphic glitches specifically lod level of detail flickering

a discordant and unappealing city soundscape rendering the developers claims about audio in the trailer incongruous

public transport lines sporadically reverting to the default color

the flatten terrain tool fails to render the land truly flat leaving undulating hills and bumps in its wake

an anomalous phenomenon of building on water in the absence of proximate water sources

issues abound in both vehicular traffic and pedestrian behavior surpassing the deficiencies observed in the first iteration of the game

vehicles mysteriously despawn while moving at full speed

ongoing utilization of a removed pedestrian crossing by simulated individuals

peculiar stopstart behavior in the traffic ais interaction with roundabouts at full speed

lastminute lane changes by the traffic ai involving abrupt stops and 90degree turns

proliferation of illegal uturns throughout the city inducing frustration

#####

when they announced that the game would release with performance issues i was ready to refund it if the performance was truly bad enough gamestar magazine provided a savegame on release to test for performance in the late game i tested the game using that savegame and found the performance to be good enough after getting my own city to 230k pop 50 hours into the game later this still holds true

there are so many things i love about this game they really put a lot of love into the road building tools compared to cs1 i love how for example single lane highways connect into multi lane highways or roads of different sizes connect into each other in general i love how trams work i love how footpaths work i love the upgradefeature system for customizing road sections and we even got surface level subways in vanilla now i love the detail that went into the economy i love all the pretty little details you can spot when you zoom in and i can clearly see that the devs had a lot of great ideas for this game and in a lot of places put a lot of love and effort into it 
however it is also clearly visible that in a lot of other places they didnt get to finish their work be that minor visual stuff like some kinds of parks or buildings not properly reacting to the weather and season like other things do missing animations for emergency vehicles or the fact that many of the systems are just completely bugged like the infinite garbage import that completly breaks your city in the late game or that they gave us so much to micromanage but no way of getting any data statistics or overlays for some of the things you could really deep dive in why can i not see the profitability of my individual public transport lines why cant i see wether or not my bus line is actually being used at night why can i not see how many vehicles i have in my depots vs how many are in use at a glance why is there no overlay to see where certain resources are used and produced why can i not manage import via cargo trainsplanesships better why can i not see the origin and target location of carstruckspedestrians on the map by simply clicking on the to get a better overview over where my traffic actually comes from there are so many things that can be micromanaged but there is simply no data to base my decisions on other than clicking and tracking everything by hand
and in the end there is no real point in micromanaging everything in the first place because the end game economy is basically just having infiinte money regardless of how much i manage my economy until it all falls apart because somehow the entire planet sends me their garbage for processing and my 10 incinerators 6 recycling centers and 3 dumps are immediatly filled to the max even when i have twice the amount of processing needed to process my own garbage and my entire city drowns in trash
i really tried to love this game and building up my first city really was a lot of fun however im at a point where i see no point in further improving my city any more because at any point the garbage problem or something else is gonna ruin it completly and all the improvements i could make dont really matter in the first place and i see no point in creating another city just to get to the same point 

when they announced the game would release with performance issues they didnt lie but they forgot that the rest of the game isnt really finished either and for a successor of the first game it really needs the endless replayability that just isnt there right now its not a bad game but it is incomplete this game would have needed another year of development or so but sadly that just seems to be the industry standard now

#####

i am enjoying my time with cs2i love these kinds of games i usually find them really relaxingbut it is genuinely the buggiest state i have ever seen a game launch in and ive played every bethesda game on launch since fallout 3 as well as cyberpunk 2077 yes i should have learned my lesson by now but this is really really bad bethesda bugs are sometimes funny sometimes a little frustrating but never completely game breaking and not remotely as frequent as in this game cyberpunk was a little frustrating and crashed often and performed like ass but again on the whole was not nearly as bad as this

the performance is absurdly bad im only several hours into my largest city so its by no means a huge megalopolis just yet and yet im struggling to maintain 30fps on the very low preset which looks like complete ass on a 7600x and 6800 xt i could handle ac valhalla at over 144fps on mediumhigh which still looked really good yet this can only just maintain 30fps at a graphics level on par with mid 00s eurojank it looks pretty good when you turn the graphics up of course but then its unplayable

its crashed a few times over my 20 hours or so ive had worse experiences as far as new games crashing a lot cyberpunk for instance it shouldnt crash at all of course but it could be a lot worse too i suppose

but just about everything in game is broken to some degree or another theres always something going wrong on screen trains flying backwards over the city trams derailing as soon as they depart a stop on a perfectly straight road until you demolish and rebuild the stop in exactly the same place buildings complaining that mailgarbageetc isnt being picked up even though theres tons of excess capacity and no traffic blocking mailgarbageetc trucks cars making completely boneheaded turns like turning down a road only to do a u turn and leave it immediately or making u turns in the middle of busy highways causing massive traffic jams on both sides etc

the whole songanddance they make about how deep the simulation is is complete bollocks citizens will be assigned jobs or school places but they dont need to physically go there ever you can just build a university on an unconnected island with no bridges or transit connections and itll still educate students just fine for instance it will need to share the island with a landfill for garbage and have watersewagepower connections of course but the landfill will still collect the universitys garbage even though again no one can get to it so long as someone is assigned a job at the landfill the landfill will send out trucks

there seems to be very limited variety in building modelstextures too i have a city with a central business district containing a bunch of skyscrapers full of offices and its a shame how a handful of building designs are repeated ad nauseum some kind of procedurally generated buildings system would have made for a cool improvement over the first game but i suppose this is only a minor gripe

i have definitely found myself missing a few things that were in the first game in some cases from launch

id be disappointed in their choice to force you to use their launcher to downloadinstallmanage mods unlike the first game which just used steam workshop except that mod support isnt even available on launch like it was for the first game mods made a big difference to my experience with cs1 in some cases fixing or significantly improving core functionality eg tmpe

this should have been an early access release paradox should not be charging full price for this game in its current state and i do kinda regret paying full price and effectively legitimising their business practices here well i wont buy another of their games on launch at least

#####

i will give you guys a good review if you give me a good game

#####

to be honest i am deeply disappointed with cities skylines ii at first glance it seemed promising but as i delved into the game it became apparent that the developers failed to seamlessly integrate several crucial aspects greatly impacting the overall enjoyment

one of the reviews i came across accurately pointed out that the traffic simulation economy simulation and sim life simulation in the game operate independently of each other this means for instance that working citizens are not required to commute to their jobs and businesses do not depend on the transportation of goods through the road network this fundamentally contradicts the promises of a deep simulation that were emphasized in the games marketing

i feel deceived and let down by this approach it seems like the developers couldnt make all these elements work together and released the game regardless

similarly like other players ive faced performance issues even when setting the graphics to low the game still experiences significant stuttering and i find myself constantly tweaking settings in search of optimal performance this is quite disappointing especially considering that my system meets the minimum requirements

i really expected more from paradox and co their decision to release the game in this state is disheartening and it falls far short of what i had anticipated this experience has left me questioning the quality of their releases and their commitment to delivering polished enjoyable gaming experiences

#####

dont get me wrong there are performance issues but the core gameplay is very good and already leaps and bounds ahead of cs1

what you dont get 10 years of dlcs rrgular patches bug fixes mods etc 

what you do get new and exciting mechanics optimised ai more enjoyable management vastly improved detail of nearly all in game assets new playstyles

strangely enough for me rtx 3080  5800x the performance is jittery at first if i try loading in with max settings but after 30 mins or so switching to 1440p and running almost max settings is absolutely fine only at 20k pop so cant account for large city yet

buy it

#####

at this point the gaming industry should just make a new game genre called enjoyable after a year

edit after the co ceos statement i am even more infuriated that i supported this game from the get go response from a main representative of the company that made this game being you dont like it then it might not be for you while ignoring constructive criticism to obviously undercooked and unfinished featuresthat served as the main marketing tool to lure people to buy this game is absolutely pathetic and over the line 

i absolutely not recommend this game if you really want to buy it then wait for a huge sale at 3rd party site because this is such a slap in the face of a consumer that it shouldnt be tolerated at any point in this games life cycle

#####

 better graphics
 lack of modding support
 traffic ai still bad
 perforamance
 fun disasters etc

half baked game

#####

check what the ceo of co just posted
thanks for all the feedback when it comes to the gameplay and simulation we set goals for the game and we have reached those goals
surely there are issues that were looking into and fixing bugs but the overall gameplay experience is what we aimed for cities skylines ii is the better game compared to the first one if you dislike the simulation this game just might not be for you if there is a bug that ruins it for you theres a good chance its fixed sometime in the future games are a subjective experience and it is impossible to please everyone theres a bugfixing patch on its way soon however so hopefully well be able to resolve at least some of the issues that may be a deal breaker for some we thank you for your patience

for clarity the above is for the simulation and gameplay the performance is not where we want it to be and we are hard at work to improve it this is also the reason the consoles were delayed the modding support is an important part of a colossal order game so it will also be rolling out as soon as possible
we are disappointed we couldnt make these aspects of the game ready for you on time but we refuse to give up the missing features and platforms will be available in the upcoming months

ill tldr and simplify it if you dont like that its not a real simulation go  yourself

i applaud the audacity games are a subjective experience yall can say that when you all deliver the game you advertised i cant believe co wants to die on this hill but with that attitude no wonder its flopping

luckily i had like 50 worth of csgo skins so i barely paid anything for this pile of trash

please dont buy this for now review was posted 30112023

#####

this review is just in terms of performance not gameplay

update after 4h okay i played till about 5000 population the framerate is more like 5060 now so the performance impact of pop is definitely very noticable

update 2 at 45k population its down to 3040 fps with occasional stutters kinda annoying but playable yeah my cpu can bottleneck this card tho in 95 of games it doesnt

with the talk of terrible performance i just wanted to boot it up real quick see if the game is even playable on 3440x1440 with my kinda dated i7 9700k and rtx 4070ti or if its gonna be a 30 fps slideshow from the start


with these tweaks from reddit user dotcax it works fine at 90fps looking at the horizon

 use fullscreen windowed or disable vsync

 disable depth of field mode

 reduce volumetrics quality to low

 disable global illumination

 reduce the level of detail to low or medium if you dont need the extra fps

 disable motion blur this is a preference if you want it keep it on low

 in the advanced tab scroll to the shadows section and disable terrain casts shadows

 if you want to squeeze a bit more performance disable fog quality though i personally prefer to keep it enabled

i also enabled taa instead of smaa and disabled ssao and set shadows to medium

when you build a big city you can probably expect it to drop a lot though still this is enough for me for the time being

#####

addictive builder  i had to turn my pc settings down but i avaerage 30 fps woth a 3070 ti

#####

the game is not what it is advertised at all i would equate it to a scam i am only sad that it took me this many hours to find out this has nothing to do with performance or optimization

check out httpsforumparadoxplazacomforumthreadsallresourcemanagementinthegameisadeception1604434

your city doesnt generate a demand for goods when you build a cargo terminal the assigned ships or trains will deliver all resources in the game to it even garbage they deliver an amount equal to terminal storage70 of one of the resources at a time a cargo port has 15500 storage capacity so you will see ships carrying 222 metal ore 222 food and so on these deliveries occur even if your city has no commercial andor industrial zones

this means that even though i have spent millions on incineratorsgarbage processing lots in a small city the games fake economy actually imports endless amounts of garbage which causes my cities to forever to have overflowing garbage 

shops in commercial zones and industrial facilities will never use these resources this was tested by placing a cargo port cutting all highway connections in the city deleting all industrial zones and creating new commercial zones near the port commercial buildings spawn with a certain amount of goods to operate with according to their type you can see this by clicking on a delivery truck and checking its owner theres an invisible warehouse inside every commercial or industrial building you can wait until their storages depleted without any interaction from customers btw and the ports storage filled with goods 222 food 222 plastics etc
so you have commercial zones with no goods no highway connections and a port full of goods do the shops send their trucks to pick up goods from the port no they just stand without goods to sell but still generate income and pay taxes they wont go bankrupt

this is not as advertised the game advertises itself as an economy simulation game on the steam page it saysw deep simulation and a living economy this is a lie the most realistic and detailed city builder ever yet it is worse than its predecessor in the actual gameplay mechanics it claims to push your creativity and problemsolving to another level however there are no problems as it is all fake without a real simulation and the only creativity is endlessly coloring plots

exports are broken it has been to tested i placed a train cargo hub near a forestry industry and cut all highway connections i had over 700 tons of surplus wood and no industry to process it why dont they deliver wood to the terminal because they can deliver wood only to logs storage which can randomly appear in an industrial zone if there are no storages the trucks will simply disappear even if they could export wood logs so if you have no logs storage in your city all your timber factories will buy logs from the outside
but maybe they export logs by teleporting them nope i forced one of the invisible forestry storages to have 659 out of 60 tons of logs and they remained at 659

i have also personally noticed indefinite crashesaccident scenes even though i have invested tons in road management offices etc sometimes the pedestrianscars glitch on crosswalks and collide and then just sit there stuck for hours

to summarize
shops and factories dont need goodsresources to generate income
you cant import goods by trains or ships to be used by shops or factories they will stay in the terminal storage indefinitely
you cant export anything
this game is a scam and is not at all what was advertised

ok after 68 hours in this game its time to weigh in tldr the game is genuinely fun and needs tweaks and balancing in its simulation 

the good amazing road tools a great step forward with transit lines and outside connections zoning improvements and building upgrades make scaling your city feel more satisfying and realistic

the bad highdensity zoning needs rescaling hard to understand the real impacts of the goodsproduction system and buildings complaining of rent and input costs building upgrades are cool but lock you in too tightly

final thoughts this game fixed the structural limitations of cs1 and most of what it needs now is in balancing and optimization im looking forward to years of innovative building 



i have my own hopes for improvement that i will save for the end of this post at this stage im still invested in learning all the mechanics and exploring the intricacies of scaling my city before i get to what i like and dislike do not fall prey to comparisons of this game to your dlc and mod stuffed cs1 people have amnesia as to just how limited cs1 was and still is it was basically a decent traffic simulator with flexible road creation cities skylines 2 is so much moreright from the startand heres why

1 the new road tools are amazing you are only limited by your imagination most of the mod tools are present straight slope seems to work by default if you manipulate the elevation step the more i started customizing my own junctions the more utilized the various snap toggles i honestly cant envision how mods can improve this much

2 transit lines are excellent the new depot system adds a whole new challenge and element of realism drawing a line for all routes both cargo and transportation seems like an obvious step forward and removes the ambiguity around how the game generates vehicles and routes its true that if you create a route without equivalent demand you will get a lot of empty vehicles this isnt a gamebreaking bug vehicles will simply go through their paces until you manually reduce the number or demand fills them up this is working fine for me 

3 zoning and demand are vastly improved the ability to overwrite zones enables you to grow your city much more naturally by increasing density when and where it is needed also the new zone types and rci demand stratification gives you much more granularity in how the city develops the separation of office from industrial demand is a no brainier the three residential densities are also separate but interrelated allowing you to focus on density or sprawl or to get the advantages of both 

4 building upgrades and operational districts enable you to manage growth without having to construct new service buildings or arbitrarily move them this also allows you to scale effectively and customize the uniformity or urban village style development 

these are just a few of the good things ive found with cs2 what i enjoy the most is the universally improved way that you grow and scale your city being able to replace zones expand roads upgrade buildings and adjust transit efficiency all work so seamlessly together to turn your city core from a hamlet to a metropolis in cs1 you had to start every new neighborhood from scratch this was always my biggest frustration which has been addressed in cs2 from the start
now on to things i dont like so much

1 bad highdensity scaling true even with larger maps we still wont get anywhere near 11 scale with an actual city but the number of workers per office is absurdly low a 40story building will have barely 100 workers in it in real life it could be in the hundreds or thousands in terms of its practical impact on my city im currently building out the neighborhoods and suburbs 60k pop with a lot more room to grow and ive already effectively maxed out the workplace availability in my downtown office district when i expand my city ill have to focus on industry or multiple high density office cores just to generate enough workplaces this big leap to skyscrapers seems more oriented to aesthetic goals but i want to see my city transform through different stages 

heres what needs to happen co needs to create a lot more models for midsize office buildings vastly though not 100 realistically increase the number of workers and tweak the demand calculations to emphasize the construction of shorter highdensity buildings when there is more available spread therefore increasing pressure to build up when there are fewer areas left to upzone this could also be simulated by adding a medium density office zone type but i would like to see this influenced directly by demand and availability of workers

2 let them fail ive seen a lot of posts about the lack of integration in the goods and production system this is all very concerning though i cant directly verify the problem industry and commercial certainly seem to run as intended for the most part but my guess is that the handicap that developers built into the base of the gameallowing industry and commercial to function basically without inputs remember in the developer diaries when they said you could play the simulation as intensely as you wanted in effect allows buildings to become perpetually distressed without failing ive still not seen any building vacate or business fail because of high rent low customers or high cost of raw materials so when should i start caring about distressed businesses

heres what needs to happen co needs to fix the goods vacuum problem but should also introduce a proper hard mode that makes businesses more tightly dependent on transportation and pricing factors for raw materials and goods show us the real impacts of failing businesses supply chain bottlenecks and unemployment this may make starting a city a lot more challenging but i say bring it on 

3 building upgrades are great but pretty please liberate us from adjacency requirements for extensions and let us demolish them without tearing down the whole building this is a pretty dumb move one of the best things about cs1 dlcs was the freedom of building campuses for airports universities and parks i sort of understand reintroducing cs1 vanilla plopability but for bigger buildings and projects it gets quite boring and limits the player from properly building neighborhoods around big assets like the university you want to challenge us with extralarge lot sizes fine but for extension buildings at least let us place rotate demolish and adjust them more freely 

heres what needs to happen simply let players snap extensions either to the parent building or to another road within a certain radius you are already limiting us to a radius for resource extractor buildings that way when the developers or modders add more extension options you can still get some of the enjoyment of customizing your own campus areas while obeying the developers original vision for the upgradeextension system as it stands upgrades and extensions work much better for smaller service buildings like police stations and clinics than for larger heavier assets like the university 

4 little things citizens are too happy crime is too low its so easy to make money i couldnt spend it all if i tried traffic ai can be derpy and needs a tune up need to stock up on more building models to diversify designs and vary density can we have workers commute from out of town not just tourists

final thoughts im not going to review bomb this game i genuinely enjoy it and it is utterly superior to its predecessor in every way i can think of what exactly is it about cs1 that we idealize so much that it was stable in terms of where cs1 started this game is on a different planet

#####

the performance sucks yes definitely
that said my system is good enough i can play it so i can comment on the rest

the game is good the gameplay is good everything is a significant upgrade over cities 1 if your system is not bleeding edge then id recommend waiting probably until the console launch  pc version should be optimized then
otherwise this is a buy from me

#####

cannot recommend as a fully released game at this time 

its fair to remember that cs1 base game sucks but it has been just under a decade since its release thats a long time for updates patches dlc mods etc we all took for granted 

ive spent a solid amount of time playing this game relative to its release date so far i can tolerate the performance issues and the bare bones base game limitations given that this is the initial launch 

that being said this cannot be recommended for purchase in its current state this should be an early access game at this point visual glitches flickering misaligned road decals glitched buildings farmmine hub buildings glitching through ground general balance issues with demand and cost and crashes 

the worst for last paradox has cast aside the primary reason cs1 was successful  the steam workshop paradoxs very small workshop in membership and participation will destroy cs2 if it is the sole source for mods 

cs2 has potential with great graphics and things like smoother zoning densities an attempt was made at creating automatically adaptable intersection markings like a popular cs1 mod offers 

but there is so so so much left to be desired and if paradox will knowingly anger its customer base and essentially handicap its own development by cutting the steam workshop then all there is to say is save your money for now

#####

i am incredibly sad to see even cs2 fall into the modern game release nonsense of selling consumers unfinished products so we can be glorified beta testers just recently at the time of this review the developers are talking about how they are working on over 100 gameplay bugs so youre telling me you had no idea the game ran this poorly i was so excited for this game after the 600 hours of cs1 but they have really missed the mark with this one please do not waste your money wait for this game to be good if it ever becomes good enough

edit 32524 the developers and publisher have completely lost touch with reality and are absolutely out of their minds regarding the state of the game and the recent launch of paid content including landscaping tools palm trees what a miserable experience this game has been so far what little hope i had they would dig this game out of the grave they put it in on launch day is quickly dwindling how sad

speed development of the city love it much more realistic dont expect housing skyscrapers at 10k population

amd ryzen 7 6000  nvidia rtx 3050 
playable definitely but lower some settings
speed at 170k population doable and i love the extra heat of my laptop warming the room

exitment on forehand 10 my bad
verdict current state of the game 65
potential game 10

final verdict 
just buy the game of you are excited like me and can handle some disappointments remember it can only get better from here 

dont buy if you expect a perfect gaming experience for this money then wait at least 6 months

refund was smoother than the actual game

the short review mixed feeling
is cities skylines 2 worth it  yes but it still needs some work and time

the longer review
the 100 hours i put into cities skylines 2 kept revealing new complexities and problems to solve
while revealing new great feature more short comings and performance issues 


if you are like me have spent years playing cs with mods and dlcs you will instantly notice a big difference and a bit of disappointment 
but to be honest cs vanilla was not fun to play either the mods and dlcs made it fun 
they have included many dlc from the first game in cs2 already but moding and the editor is not available yet and we dont know when the editor will be released
i really miss all the mods and am waiting for them
i can go on about the details of the game but there are bunch of youtube videos explaining how to play it and optimize what is already there

i think the developers need more time to optimize the game and include more things so far they have been listening to people and acting towards fixing issues
i think colossal order should gift everyone a dlc as a sorry for the early release and performance issues 
spending 100 hrs also means that im hooked already and am hopeful for better fixes and bunch of mods to optimize my game

the economic simulation that co so proudly advertised is a complete hoax there is a reddit post that goes way more indepth into this than i possibly could but tldr is that the ingame simulation includes nothing like supply chains exports imports based on demand and resource processing 

the reddit post in question httpswwwredditcomrcitiesskylinescomments17had80all_resource_management_in_the_game_is_a_deceptionutm_sourceshareutm_mediumweb2xcontext3

edit 
co responded apparently its a bug and it wasnt intentional while its good that they responded so quickly it very much isnt good that basically the core feature of the game and what distinguishes it from its predecessor is at the moment nonfunctional it makes me wonder what other systems are broken like this

cos response httpsforumparadoxplazacomforumthreadsimexportbughintssymptomsandcausesallresourcemanagementinthegameisadeception1604434page4#post29216506

edit 2 looks like a recent hotfix has fixed some of the problems i really dont wanna waste time downloading the game again but it looks like they fixed the commercial districts no costumer problem and shops importing far too many goods im not seeing anything about the economic simulation in general though

game is already starting to feel more stable after the second patch cs ii has a surprising and impressive level of detail and nuance the cities really start to feel very alive once you get going definitely a lot of fun even coming from the original 

a couple of things ive learned 
  when you see rent is too high  you generally just need to up the density of the zones seems obvious but it took me a minute to figure that out 
  parking seems to be very important for cs ii if you start zoning medium or high density residentialcommercial its very important to make sure to have some extra parking lots cars will just drive around aimlessly for hours looking for parking if they cant find any
  education is pretty important make sure to build the elementary schools high schools and colleges as soon as they are unlocked income will massively increase once citizens start to get educated especially at the college level 
  garbage works a little bit differently in cs ii the incinerators still seem to be a bit buggy but its not gameplaybreaking co has acknowledged this apparently the next patch will fix it just zone a landfill and expand the zone for now itll work fine
  service range seems to be a lot better in cs ii no need to plaster the map with crematoriums and incinerators anymore just one or two will usually do massively improved over cs1 
  make sure to check the air pollution map before zoning industrial wind direction impacts where the pollution will go 
  the traffic ai is pretty advanced cars use all available lanes traffic accidents happen in congested areas and cims even get lost sometimes really neat to see the depth of the simulation although do note it takes a little bit of getting use to some of the strategies that worked for cs1 might be different for cs ii im still learning how to manage traffic its definitely different in cs ii 
  you can still get the nice avenues with trees in cs2 but you need to go into the road tools and add them from there by default theyre built without the trees but its still possible to get them they look pretty nice once they have them of course the downside is that you lose parking on the road by doing this so make sure you have extra parking lots in busier areas 

the game still has some bugs its not necessarily perfect at this point in time but i also definitely didnt feel like any of the issues were remotely gameplaybreaking after the second patch the game is a lot of fun and definitely feels like its going to be a great successor to the original especially once you get familiar with how cs ii does things

im just leaving a negative review in the hopes that with enough people like me doing the same that the company takes the feedback that we are tired of paying increasingly ludicrous amounts of money for games that arent finished we who are fed up with game companys releasing games with little to no substance or with major performance issues or bugs this practice needs to end we deserve to have the game that was promised and payed for on launch not 1 month down the track not 1 year down the track 

in regards to the game itself everyone has talked about poor performance so i wont rehash that too muchbut yes it iscan be bad 5000 population which only takes like 1 hour to get a city to this level seems to start taking fps considering my fps on medium graphicswhich at 30 fps is playable enough on this type of game any loss is significant also game seems to have odd antialiasing issue where the setting doesnt seem to change any thing thing still appear jagged regardless of setting used also seems like not a lot of effort went into textures game looks extremely downgraded compared to videosclips of the game from publisher

we are not paying aud12995 for early access so why does the game release like it is still in beta

also specs so you can see that this is not a game that my pc should be struggling with
running at 3840x2160 medium i get 3038fps with fsralso game only supports fsr10 so it looks like crap

i have a rtx 4090 and when i start the game the lights in my room start flickering bro this game is destroying my house where is the optimization

#####

game is great and i think its gonna be around for a long time you just cant build this quick or this good in cities skylines 1 which im going to compare it against the frist game is my favorite game of all time 10k hours playtime and this is in my view a good successor i played cs1 since that game was launched in 2015 and i could tell you all about how that game is not comparable to the cs1 we got today with all the user generated content ive so far sunk 300 hours into cities skylines 2 and during that time i have completed several incredible cities from scratch urlhttpssteamcommunitycomidteddyradkoscreenshotsappid949230look up my steam screenshots for proofurl this is something that just wasnt achievable for me in cs1 during the same time scale

bperformanceb
this game has performance issues right now nobody is denying that none so bad that they prevent me from playing and enjoying the game thoroughly i trust the devs will do all in their power to improve the game post launch but that doesnt change the fact that i already like this game alot even with all the current limitations im also on pretty modest hardware where most parts are from 2013

cpu intel core i74770k
gpu asus rog strix geforce rtx 3060 oc
ram patriot extreme performance viper 3 32gb
mobo asus z87pro atx
ssd samsung basic 840series 250gb

bsettingsb
you may want to tune the settings properly to have the best gameplay experience possible the best settings ive found to tweak for performance gains are the following
 set level of detail to low this may double your fps crank it up to high temporarily if you need high detail far out satelite screenshots
 disable dynamic resolution it doesnt do what it did in cs1 it just makes the game really blurry
 consider lowering resolution 4k will reduce your fps significantly compared to 2k
 turn off depth of field
 lower volumetrics and cloud qualities

for full transparency i will say that i got this game for free as part of the content creator early access campaign and this is how ive already played 300h with that said this is my independent and honest review the game is great even with all the issues it still has i will highly recommend the game for anybody who is serious about city builder games if youre not sure if the game will run well on your hardware you can try it and refund if it doesnt work out for you

i am a longterm paradox games fan i have spent thousands of hours playing their grand strategy games i have spent thousands of hours modding their games so i do know a bit about their quality of coding and release quality of dlcs etc i have spent hundreds of hours playing cities skylines i

i loved cities skylines i and i was really looking forward to cities skylines ii but this game in its current state is just not recommendable i am getting tired of those unfinished releases full of bugs and abysmal performance issues even i hobby modder was able to fix a ton of bugs of buggy paradox product releases so i know how difficult or easy it can be to fix their bugs and i am telling you right now

i am observing paradox product releases for quite a while now and it feels like its only getting worse and worse more and more bugs are being released with their new product releases and many of those bugs are not difficult to fix at all 

now if it was the case that they simply did not know about their bugs and tried to fix them asap after release then it would be at least a bit understandable in my opinion but they do know about their buggy low quality and unfinished releases and they decide to release their games and dlc anyway in such a terrible state

why do companies like paradox interactive and colossal order not learn from their mistakes in the past a ton of unfinished and buggy dlc releases and even buggy main game releases why do they not learn from mistakes of other studios like cd projekt reds cyberpunks unfinished release you know why because they think they dont need to people will buy their products anyway

even with a highend hardware setup and super low graphic settings this game is still super super demanding and making your hardware run very very hot and performing poorly or mediocre at best despite using low graphic settings and therefore getting bad graphics ingame so right now you can choose between super bad performance with mediocre graphics or mediocre performance with super bad graphics and i am not even speaking about other bugs of this game honestly this is so bad

i dont think customers should be treated like this and i really regret that i bought this game i highly recommend not to buy this game and i highly recommend not to support this behavior of releasing unfinished and buggy products i think those companies will never learn from their mistakes until they feel a real backlash in the form of disappointing sales numbers

this game and especially how it was released is a huge disappointment in my opinion

#####

i loved cities 1 so i instantly preordered deluxe edition of cities 2 and i was scammed 

there is no proper simulationeconomics in the game
there is nothing to do actually

your late game is looking at these messages
 no customers
 high rents

but why  there are not proper stats information nothing to fix it

there are zero challenges with the traffic

oh there is finally a dlc beach properties  like extra assets but you dont have beaches in the game

i was defending colossal order for a long time but releasing the empty dlc counting on modders to fix the game 
shame on you

#####

a lot of technical issues useless audio limited models and textures
however i still cant stop playing it amazing city building experience 
hopefully all the issues will be fixed with patches

h1cities skylines 2 a disappointing city simulatorh1

h3 poorh3
ithis game is a disappointment for anyone who is looking for a realistic and immersive experience of urban planning and management it is poorly optimized unbalanced and lacking in features it is just a pale imitation of cities skylines which is a more quality and diverse originali

this game is for those who love designing and managing complex and realistic cities but it will also frustrate you with many flaws and limitations

h2gameplayh2

the gameplay of the game is frustratingly slow and it is unclear what causes this issue despite all your desire you cannot speed up the game enough to see how the economy works in a longerterm perspective the economy itself is poorly balanced and relies only on the money that you get for completing missions there is no point in making a profit without a special need and there are some bugs with the productions that give you an unfair advantage the purchase of land plots is also artificially limited by the level of settlement as there is no money problem it seems that the current level of monetization and costs of various elements was specially configured for easier debugging of the product by testers the game needs some intervention and there should also be a more challenging mode when money is really scarce

h2graphicsh2

the graphics of the game are also disappointing especially when compared to the screenshots the vegetation the shadows related to it and the tire marks on the roads are terrible the water looks beautiful up close but turns into a monotonous puddle from afar the texture streaming is also a major problem which makes the terrain look like mush even at a short distance and the signs painted on the roads load right before your eyes sometimes for 10 seconds the lighting is also not welladjusted and looks very raw

h2performanceh2

the game is also poorly optimized and it can run very poorly even on highend hardware for example on rtx4090 and ryzen7900x3d the frame rate can drop to 17 frames per second which is unacceptable for a city simulator the game does not seem to utilize the full potential of these powerful components and it suffers from frequent stuttering and lagging

before the release of cities skylines 2 the developers admitted that the game had performance issues and that they had not achieved the benchmark they targeted  they claimed that the game was built for the future with modern hardware in mind and that it added more depth and detail than its predecessor however this seems to be an excuse to cover up the games unfinished state as many players complained of performance woes even on highend hardware  the developers also provided an optimization guide for players to tweak the games settings but this did not solve the core problems of the game

h2featuresh2

the game also lacks some features that would make it more enjoyable and customizable such as editors and mods there are no editors which they promise to add soon funny mods are limited only to paradox plaza which is a huge drawback for the modding community as they removed the support for steam workshop which was a great platform for sharing and downloading mods this decision seems to be motivated by greed and exclusivity rather than by quality and diversity

the game also did not launch in early access which could have been a better option to gather feedback and improve the game over time instead the developers decided to release the game as a full product even though they knew it was not ready this shows a lack of respect for the players and their expectations and a disregard for the quality and diversity of the game

h2conclusionh2

overall cities skylines 2 is a game that has a lot of potential but also a lot of flaws it fails to deliver a realistic and immersive experience of urban planning and management it needs more polish and balance to become a truly great city simulator i would not recommend buying this game at its current state unless you are willing to wait for updates and patches that might fix some of the issues even fans of the genre might be disappointed by this game as it does not offer anything meaningful or innovative it is just a pale imitation of cities skylines which is a more quality and diverse original

i hope that my review will change to a positive one over time as the developers fix the issues and improve the game i would love to see cities skylines 2 become a great city simulator that respects its players and its genre however for now i cannot recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a realistic and immersive experience of urban planning and management

bros forgot to optimise the game 

worse fps than star citizen 

18fps in menus with a 3080ti 

#####

tough one

long time cs1 fan but cs2 leaves me feeling both impressed at how much the engine has come on and disappointed at how much has been lost 

firstly kudos to co for at least warning us that the game was unoptimised but looking around at recent history should have told co that this was an opportunity however annoyed it may have left fans for them to delay this release by a few months more to get it into a fit state 

after 15 hours of playtime on the sequel i feel confident enough with a city of 110k to review the game fairly 

so firstly the pros

 game engine is much improved buildings look better animations are much better for the most part 
 the sims feel much more alive you see them travelling and periods such as rush hour are now accurately reflected as opposed to cs1 where roads would grind to a halt anytime of day which leads on to
 the road layout tool is vastly improved at first it may look like its a simplified version of what we had in cs1 but there are powerful tools underneath the initial views that allow you to control many more aspects of the road layout the ai also uses roads in a much more common sense way changing lanes and trying to avoid jams
 european and north american options for the most part apart from low density habs look sufficiently different although things like trains and some lorries are not localised with big old american trains for cargo spoiling some of the immersion 
 development points is a win replacing the standard unlocks as you grow your city you can now select particular buildings or service in the order you want to it makes for different playthroughs and options each time and gives you more control over areas to focus on in city development a major improvement over cs1
 slightly stolen from the last simcity but the ability to upgrade existing service buildings is a welcome addition rather than having to plop 10 different small police stations across your city you can now typically get away with one or two and simply upgrade them with larger garages or improved services the majority of the time its cheaper than buying a new building and increases the coverage area which reminds me
 the service coverage area for most service buildings is far more generous now gone are the days of having to plan to build 3 elementary schools all within the same area of your city because of their laughable service coverage zone service buildings now cover significant parts of the map i did the earlier to midgame with the very first police and fire stations you unlocked until i got to a pop of around 25k impossible in cs1 without the city resembling a friday night out in essex

now the negatives
 its day 2 of release so mods will come but right now the game feels sparse minimal buildings and options for many of the different types of service such as schools and police means once youve unlocked one or two lines of each services development section youve pretty much seen it all  im really hoping those of us who invested heavily in dlc for cs1 arent going to be stung by countless additional dlc that simply should be in the base game to start with its pretty weak currently and once youve unlocked most things there isnt a great deal to do beyond continuing to grow your city with the same buildings
 the game should have released with the creation kit and mods good to go if they can bung free copies to influencers to try and butter us all up over the last few weeks they could have done the same for the actual valuable members of the cs community aka the modders it would have left the launch feeling much less sparse on the subject of modding im not precious about steam workshop or their own version of it i would have just liked to have seen mods here at the start to make up for the lack of content 
 pathing whilst vastly improved is still an issue later in city growth get above 80k pop in a decent size city and regardless of improving your roads the ai seems to have a fit and forget all of the smart stuff its been doing up to this point and rely on the same core roads and pathing as opposed to the countless other options i tried to put in place for them to use which reminds me 
 public transport feels generally broken at the minute in a city of 110k i have 1 using buses despite very generous spreading of stops across my city 0 using trams 1 using the subway and 0 using my passenger trains seems pretty pointless very expensive and totally contributes to the snarling up of the road network definitely contributes to the end game making you feel like you are just constantly firefighting the road network than actually city planning and needs to be patched urgently
 the ui is pretty awful everything from setting bus lines to the size of menu screens and the lack of customisation around being able to move with the mouse all feels weak at the moment and less than what we had in cs1 its frustrating when you are laying out a transport line and suddenly a menu pops on screen and deletes all of the progress youve been making laying out your line
 ill talk about optimisation more generally below but stability wise ive had one crash my rig details below but most important point here for some unknown reason autosave is switched off by default which in a game like this where hours of work could be lost to a crash seems insane to me make sure its the first option you switch on and to the devs id strongly urge you to have this switched to on by default 

optimisation 
ok the big one 
firstly kudos to co for admitting they had a problem but that admittance should have led to them doing the right thing for their customers and delaying the release but hey we live in a shareholder driven world so needs must i guess 

optimisation is extremely poor depending on your hardware choices what this means looking at the steam hardware survey is that 99 of people will not have a game that feels next gen when they play co have themselves advised switching off a bunch of graphical options to get a decent framerate and whilst this isnt call of duty where frames  better the standard in 2023 should be having the game run at a minimum of 60fps for the vast majority of users this unfortunately wont be the case for many many people 

so things to make your experience more stable if less pretty 
 switch off depth of field  1020 fps improvement
 switch off vsync  same sort of frame gain as depth of field
 try flicking between borderless window and fullscreen some are reporting frame gains of between 510 fps
 run it in 1080p if you have to  can give you 20fps or more
 switch off all of the volumetric options  1020 fps 

all of the above is obviously dependent on your own hardware setup but on mine i9 12900k rtx 3080 ti 12gb and 64gb ddr5 ram ive been seeing a stableish framerate of 6885 fps with a pop of 110k running in 4k 

your own experiences may vary and im not disagreeing that some folks with better hardware than me are having a worse time than i have and this simply reinforces the point that optimisation does seem to be all over the place at the minute 

in summary though its not good enough when people with 5k rigs are having to switch graphical options off for a game that isnt a fps then something is quite clearly badly wrong in how its been built and delivered to its users 

the hope of course is over the coming days and weeks the game will be patched but that still isnt good enough for a 41 game that many folks have been preordering and building up to for most of this year sure it would have been annoying to delay it by another month or two but it would have earned co a significant bit of kudos and support from the community rather than the review bombing and open hostility we have now 

in summary then its ok but for those with weaker rigs avoid for now and wait for patches to come im pretty disappointed

#####

the game fells better than cs1 but in the current state its literally unplayable im sure they will come with later updates to fix this mess but until then id stay away from it lesson learned will never preorder a game ever againreally had high hopes for this one

#####

i recommend but at your own risk if you just want to get into a city builder because yo like creating roads and laying out a city etc you may have fun with this  however this is not a game at present that provides any challenge you do not have any consequences for a mistake or for forgetting to install or build a certain city service  heck you dont even have to pay for your roads the roads pay you without even needing a tollbooth 
i thought it was really weird to have barely any population and not be in the red for the miles and miles of road i placed down seriously i built out all my main roads interstate highways interchanges intersections i built all upgraded city services education medical etc with only a population of a few thousand but i was raking in money faster than i could spend it i have over 80000 residents and make over 2 million credits per month i have more roads rail air boats than i have areas filled by residents i have so many roads etc that most of them dont even get used

somehow my children and teens get highly educated even though i have 6000 eligible for hs but only 600 actually go to high school meanwhile my elementary schools are completely full 1200 students each in 5 schools  over 6000 kids i did have a college and university but i deleted them this did not have any effect on my high schools attendance  there should be a policy that says teenagers can not  go to college nor go to work until they have graduated hs

no middle schools in which world do kids go from elementary school straight to hs why isnt their any middle schools

pedestrians why do pedestrians jay walk why do they jay walk when they are provided beautiful pedestrian bridges  yes i have turned off crosswalk on my intersection but some pedestrians refuse to obey the laws most of them use the bridges but 10 which is a lot walk across the road and stop the flow of traffic  additionally it seems like everyone walks more people walk than actually drive i followed a lot of sims from their homes to their work or other activities they dont use the taxi the bus the metro nor use their own cars instead they walk miles and miles to get to work even though a bus stop and taxi stand are nearby as well as a reasonably close metro stop what is going on here

resource extraction some of my resources actually perform really well but others under perform even though the areas rated yield is 300 to 800 tn they never produce even half that and in my production tab it shows i have a deficit of double that rated production output what is happening there is this a bug no matter how many  more of these same resources i plot my production is never enough and it does not reflect what the resource production limit for the drawn out or zoned area is  this is just one aspect of the production chain

i could go on about other issues but i am tired its late at night so please buy and play the game at your own risk it has many improved features and other mechanics that cities skylines lacked mods fixed that however cs2 is not complete nor enjoyable if you were hoping to keep your city from failing with every new road zone service industry or etc you installed because for now it is impossible to fail no matter how badly you build the city

good luck have fun  for now until a major update is done or mods are officially supported i will not play anymore i will continue to play world of warships

#####

this game is clearly unfinished and should not have been released in the state it was multiple systems in the game are broken and unless you take the time to terraform your city with the studiousness of a bonsai tree it is going to look disgusting and unrealistic after just a short amount of time the poor graphics optimization also render this title almost unplayable unless you have a bleeding edge rig

shame on paradox interactive for forcing co to release this half formed turd

#####

generally speaking i dont like to do reviews i know theyre beneficial for the community and they help buyers decide but return policies exist for a reason and that reason is so that people can try it decide if they like it on their own and then return it  that being said when something is in such a state of horror that it defies logic i think its my duty to save you the reader from making the same mistake i did

i have been playing city builder games since before a lot of you were born i started with the first sim city in 1989 and have been an avid fan of the genre ever since  i love how the genre evolved over time and the games became more complex and at the same time more rewarding  its my idea of a perfect saturday afternoon sitting down listening to some chill music and watching as my planning unfolds into this megalopolis that was in my head  i love it so much that i had even started my 4yearold daughter down the path by having her sit with me and picking and choosing where we placed certain things in cities skylines 1 and showing her how the different mods worked

when i saw the advertisements for cities skylines 2 i foamed at the mouth with excitement and my daughter was over the moon that we were going to get a new better game that promised many more hours of enjoyment  we decided to purchase the top package that guaranteed us the most bang for our buck and the not yet released but announced dlcs that would add stuff as we started a new city together  we stayed home on game release day to make sure we were among the first to download and start building our new shiny city together  much to our dismay however the game was slow clunky and basically unplayable on a threadripper 3960x w 128gb of ddr4 and 2x rtx 3090s  we were sad to say the least but we still had hope  

people started sharing settings then official announcements came with other settings and we finally stopped having 13fps and got it up to 30fps  so it was playable right  well not really  there was still masssive stutter from time to time especially when inside of game menus i mean theyre menus why on earth are they causing the fps to plummet and dropping dozens of frames  it was and still is so bad that it randomly causes the usb to reset and the famous windows chimes that tell you when a usb has disconnected and reconnected play through the speakers  and then a patch was announced that promised to fix some of the biggest problems with performance so we stayed home again only to be let down once again  there was maybe a 5 percent performance increase overall and the menus were still causing massive game lag  co admitted fault and released patch after patch after patch in quick succession that we were overjoyed that soon we would get to be able to enjoy the game   but that time never came  

co stopped patching but promised that they would not release any of the dlc and more paid content until they got the base game right because that is what was most important to them  another promise another let down  now not only did they release a paid dlc before fixing the game they had to gall to charge 999 for it  bare in mind here i paid for the deluxe edition so it was free for me but it also let me know how much extra i would really be getting for the extra money i spent and it doesnt seem like much 

if i had one piece of advice for anyone looking to buy this game in its current state it would be to run very fast in the opposite direction of your computer screen  i cannot n good conscience recommend that anyone buy this game  instead take your family out for a dinner go see a movie go spend your money on anything else just dont buy this game  i would recommend spending the night in a trap house or a shooting gallery before i would recommend you purchase this game

so thanks colossal order for not only stealing my money but also disappointing my daughter  shame on you and paradox interactive for releasing such a steaming pile of garbage

#####

this is probably going to be an amazing game once the issues are resolved  however i would like to make it very clear that the skylines community are not a bunch of idiots  we realise we have been missold a game that is still in beta release as a gold release at full price because paradox publishing need the money to keep the developers employed  this has annoyed me  its as if everyone after covid 19 lockdown are scamming people in economic survival but its the one thing we have all shared as a global community and would all understand  im not slamming the  devs or even the publishers  im just pointing out that we are not idiots and know this game is still in beta and shouldnt have been released as a gold release   

we all know this and are a bit upset you didnt think we would notice  we have

i would recommend this game once it reaches the gold release standard and actually functions as advertised in the trailers  it will probably take at least 6 months or so until it is fit to purchase as a playable proper game  its not the devs fault they have done an amazing job with a very complex game and i understand why paradox have released it in order to make the business function  but they could have released it as a beta game at half price until it was fit for gold release got the skyline community to test it and give it fantastic reviews and fixed all the issues without all the hype and great expectations  even the modding communities would have fixed half the issues for free and the asset creators could have posted images of assets to come  hindsight paradox of a community that likes to be involved and improve upon a brilliant game  make use of your community dont exclude and gaslight them

#####

let me start off with some basic and relevant pc specs
cpu  amd 7900x 12 core  24 thread no oc
gpu  evga rtx 3080
ram  corsair 32gb 6000 mhz
storage  samsung 980 pro 1tb nvme game storage
monitor  lg 27 inch 1440p 240hz oled model 27gr95qe 

so after playing this game for a little over 7 hours here are my thoughts

game play overall very enjoyable and above and beyond what vanilla cities skylines 1 had to offer at the start and i love that some dlc are already included in the new game that were not initially available in the older one that said you can tell that there are a lot of things that will eventually be added to the game in the form of dlc or mods but it does not subtract from the game due to the fact that there are so many quality of life improvements and so much has been added in general personally i never felt a need for much extra and the game did not make me feel like i was missing much there is a ton to do in just the base game although it can feel a bit tedious and micromanaging at times its definitely fun and will undoubtedly take up countless hours of my time just like cities skylines 1 did there are some mods that i do sorely miss but ill go a bit more in depth into that later

bugs there are what feel like quite a few small bugs and i assume a lot of them are just because the game is much more in depth and i am doing something wrong or incorrectly for example i always have the icons for high rent or not enough customers even though there are plenty of low rent residential and medium housing available and a ton of outside connections at times it can feel like the infinite demand mod is in the game as well since you zone a particular area and even though you just zoned more of the demand it just skyrockets right back up there are also times that road placement can be a bit hit or miss and there are a lot of small texture bugs that go along with that there is also the occasional residential house that has no access to a road or pedestrian access even though it is placed directly next to a road that problem is often easily solved by just bulldozing the house and letting it rebuild itself that is the most ive encountered in my playtime and im sure some if not most is due to user error on my part

mods although this is a bit of hot topic i for one do not care where you can access them from as long as they are available sure being able to easily access them directly from steam was a nice luxury but i do not mind having to go somewhere else to get them if it means more people can enjoy their game more some mods i definitely miss for example traffic manager move it prop line tool anarchy etc not being able to individually choose how i want to place road signs can be a bit frustrating at times and so i have a ton of roundabouts in my city now hopefully this will come in the form of a mod or an update and soon thats really all i have to say on the matter

performance again another hot topic ive read a lot of reviews about performance being an issue and to them id say maybe try adjusting settings or checking your pc for issues that might be causing bottlenecks i have yet to have any real frame rate issues and the game runs infinitely better than cities skylines 1 ever did even without mods most of the time i am hovering anywhere between 70 and 80 fps at 1440p with occasional dips to the mid 50s when i zoom out enough to see my entire city and this was all with a population of 25000 citizens in a pretty dense area im running most of my settings on high with some specific features turned down or disabled all together leave a comment if youd like more info all that being said i do think we should see a bit better performance but i do not think its terrible by any means and i only expect it to get better in the near future

overall id definitely recommend the game its fun feels much more involved has a ton to offer in just the base game and it will only get better from here also always remember that you have a refund window if you are unhappy

this review can take two paths one leaning towards recommendation with caveats and the other leaning away but acknowledging potential so lets dive into both perspectives with a warming tale of urban simulation

comparing my initial experience with the predecessor at its launch to this sequels debut the latter is significantly enhanced how so

the first cities skylines emerged as a beacon of hope for disenchanted simcity aficionados establishing itself as the new pinnacle of citybuilding games it fostered a vibrant community of players designers and modders whose contributions have shaped its evolution it surpassed simcity in innovation breaking away from traditional gridbased layouts and introduced players to sophisticated urban planning concepts sparking a niche for urbanist content creators online yet when comparing the original titles in their base formssans mods and additional contentthe first installment feels somewhat lacking features like the daynight cycle and diverse transit options were absent at launch only introduced through subsequent updates and expansions

cities skylines 2 in contrast launches with a comprehensive suite of features from daynight cycles and seasons to mixeduse zoning and a nuanced economy reminiscent of the depth in simcity 2000 it offers a richly detailed urban simulation transportation options are expansive and city planning tools are versatile allowing for intricate road layouts and efficient traffic management the sequel also introduces environmental considerations such as pollution and disasters enhancing the games realism and depth

so why do some hold reservations with a yes but  stance

without delving into widespread criticisms already familiar to those reading multiple reviews the crux of hesitation stems from misaligned expectations regarding performance game mechanics clarity and content depth initial performance issues and a ui that some found obtuse have overshadowed the games ambitious improvements despite these challenges the game has undergone extensive patching with more updates on the horizon

a key point of contention has been content having been part of the original games journey from its 2015 release i witnessed its evolution and the explosion of community engagement it spurred this set high expectations for the sequels content offerings leading to disappointment for some at launch due to perceived insufficiencies and aesthetic choices

however the potential for improvement is evident the current drawbacksperformance optimization ui clarity resource demands tool refinement and the absence of mods and editing toolsare all addressable the development teams commitment to resolving these issues suggests a bright future for the game

in essence if youre considering the game know this i recommend but  be aware of the ongoing fixes and adjustments and you might find much to enjoy i dont recommend however  if you temper your expectations you can appreciate the sequels vast potential to redefine city simulation games the first game claimed the genres throne by merit and its successor is poised to defend it even if it faces challenges along the way

acknowledging the games current state its clear that there are specific areas needing attention

further performance enhancements are necessary to ensure smoother gameplay
the user interface requires more intuitive indicators to better understand the game mechanics
the game demands a significant amount of computational resources which might limit its accessibility
the existing tools could use refinement for a more polished experience
the absence of additional options such as props prop tools and decorative items is felt
the game currently lacks mod support a feature eagerly awaited by the community
essential editing tools including map and asset editors are not available yet limiting creative freedom
the console versions release is still pending leaving a portion of the audience waiting
bugrelated issues have led to delays in the release of the ultimate edition and its first two dlcs
some major bugs still require thorough investigation and resolution

#####

yes there are some performance issues but the gameplay itself is really enjoyable and big upgrade from first generation game although bike lanes etc are missing at the moment

#####

this isnt ready for the next gen hardware its ready for the one after that

#####

it will be much better to play this game at least 3 years later

#####

fun game impressive increase in detail from the last one

turn off depth of field to get your frames back

#####

despite its pitfalls at launch i am very much enjoying this game performance is manageable and in my experience little different now to the first cities skylines building is smooth and infinitely faster than in the first game a junction that would take 45 minutes to complete to still end up looking questionable can now be done in minutes so many frustrations and quirks of the first game have vanished i find this game infinitely more enjoyable than the first it is unfortunate that mods are not released in an official capacity yet but at the moment a realisticish city is more than possible without any i think this game is getting too much flak based on assumptions that it would live up to every niche expectation that was available in the first game anyone looking to build a city and do it peacefully easily and enjoyably should get this game

#####

get it on gamepass to see if it preforms well on your system

#####

in 3 yrs this will be a classic which will go for a decade admittedly barebones now but really enjoying it even so

#####

when you ignore or work around the performance issues cities skylines ii is an impressive city builder game and a hefty improvement over it predecessor unfortunately there isnt many landscaping options other then paths bushes and trees but hopefully they will add more options in the future although the game is good right now i still believe the game shouldve been released as early access and full release delayed until the performance issues were fixed

things you can do to improve performance
 turn off v sync
 disable dynamic resolution
 disable depth of field
 disable fog
 disable volumetric quality
 disable global illumination
 disable motion blur
 set level of detail to lowvery low

gpu nvidia geforce rtx 2060
cpu intel core i510400 cpu  290ghz 2901 mhz 6 cores
ram 16gb

running the game at 1080p medium settings except for above options
avg fps when starting new city 55
begins dropping slowly as city grows bigger frequent staggering when zoomed in on heavily populated areas
have not tested performance on lower settings

i would still heavily recommend this game to anyone thinking of buying as many performance issues will probably get resolved in future patches and game updates

정식발매된 게임을 얼티메이트 에디션까지 삿는데 왜 난 얼리억세스를 하고 있는 것일까

expensive early access game disguised as an official release

#####

colossal order paradox
i am getting tired

on release day
it was playable but disaster
maybe it will get better i told myself

one week passed
maybe it will get better

one month passed
maybe it will get better

three months passed
maybe it will get better

now
i dont know

the game is not ready colossal order and paradox
way too many bugs
poor performance everywhere
the game is literally losing its mind after 100k population

how the hell did this game get an ok to release

i am so damn tired

#####

im a big fan of first game game that runs locked at 60 fps on wqhd with 500 additional mods this one runs on almost a blank map with some settings turned off or down on unstable 2030 fps and looks like crap compared to prequel releasing this kind of unoptimized mess of a game is just unacceptable and should be punished in some way running on 5900x 6900xt 32gb ram 980 pro m2 after around 30 hours of playing the game almost every part of it is broken garbage postal services cargo almost everything is in shambles or straight doesnt work needs really good amount of patches so far stay with cs1 and dont buy it or you will just be supporting paying for doing their beta testing

#####

one of the worst games ever released the ceo of paradox  collossal order should be ashamed

if i walked into a bank and stole 50 million dollars id be in jail

but if you steal 50 million dollars with a fraudulent marketing scam digused as a video game your stock price goes up

additionally it is impossible to provide constructive criticism on the forums because their janitors will instantly ban anyone who is rightful negative

do not buy this game

#####

i have a 3060ti and it starts with 25fps in menu full screen max details

1 disable depth of field  increase fps by 100
2 windowed full screen  increase again by 100

i am now at 100fps everything else remained  in on max
will add here further tweaks if i find

i doubt this was not known before the big day

edit  in gameany map  50fps
3 drsq  constant amd fx

i am now at 80 fps in game  at fhd empty map

edit 2 after developer patch  i have now 100fps

4 set fhd 60hz  fullscreen 
reduce gpu workload from 98 to 5560
therefore gpu temp drop from 80c90hotspot to 65c

#####

the good
the best city simulator out there by far it improved on multiple things to its predecessor such as more realistic population density and better road tools unlocking buildings through a tech tree makes it also feel more like a game than a sandbox and i like that we can have a fresh start after all cs1 felt very bloated at the end and without mods it started to feel old

the neutral
while the game improved graphically very much i think on quick glance it still looks a bit self similar to the old one this wouldnt be so bad if there wasnt such a big performance cost to it i just didnt quite get the wow look how pretty this is effect you expect with hardware requirements like this

the bad
there are bugs as is customs with almost any new big title these days at least small updates are being released on a regular basis unlike other cases hello starfield but the unpolished feel is mostly responsible for the currently mixed reviews
second the game is unreasonably performance intensive even though 30fps doesnt feel as bad as it sounds  at least for me the frame rate while low is stable but they still have to improve things because i think games like this should also be playable for people with cheap computers
and lastly some things some people might call essential are missing such as quay walls and many things i can and cant think of right now

overall i think its a very good game and although its a bad habit to just trust companies to clean up their problems after you gave them money in this case i do

im so disappointed ive loved cities skylines and was really looking forward to cities skylines ii
i did a prerelease purchase as soon as i could i was looking forward to building bigger and more diverse cities

but the game just cant run when you reach a certain population size no its not your computer slowing the game its the game
the road tool is much improved like many have said and the graphics are pretty but paradox recommendation to the above issue is to reduce the graphics so you are left with a nice road tool and my partner has been playing around with making interesting roundabouts 
ive let paradox have five months before this review and i dont really feel like any progress has been made 

i regret my purchase and recommend cities skylines the first you can get it at a great price now  and it actually runs

#####

it works fine with on my 3060ti

#####

i was so excited for this game and i am utterly disappointed
day one review i only did the tutorial and the snapping is not working right or i just couldnt get it to work right connecting anything roads sewage electric is a nightmare for example i select what i think is the end of the sewage line but it ends up in the middle of the river far away from where i selected the whole point of this game is to enjoy building a city and i couldnt get through more than the tutorial why change something that worked great in cities skylines i love the new ui in cities ii and i love the new look and the options to build cities with no restrictions i just wish the actual city buildinggame play wasnt frustrating hopefully they get this issue fixed or make it easier to use

update after giving it another chance and 8 hours of gameplay this game is waaaay more difficult than cities skylines there is a lot more to manage and your city can quickly get out of control very fast changes i personally dont enjoy 1 everything costs points to upgrade so it takes longer to get upgrades  2 the ads on the music do not go away even when toggled off 3 traffic can no longer be contained with just making roads bigger you now need to incorporate stop signs street lights etc when road traffic is congested there is no notification or indication of the issue besides a tiny avatar above the car in an accident 4 needing commercial zones to be super close to residential in order to have customers i wanted to make a shopping mall type vibe but this doesnt work for the longterm sustainability of a city 5 adding the zones for industry chickens farming logging etc but then not allowing surplus to be sold for profit cmon this was a huge missed opportunity to help players get profit in early game i made it to boom town 6 and was still not making a profit despite constant need for all zones the only reason my city was staying afloat was due to the money from leveling up 6 last but definitely not least save your game often this game crashes even when it is paused and youve stepped away from the pc 

overall this game couldve been so much better but they pretty much took a great game cities skylines and made a bad remake of it they changed mechanics of the game that make the game waaaay too difficult for a casual player i used to play cities all night but now i can barely tolerate to play for a few hours

#####

i played this game in vanilla mode already over 130 hours and to be honest i like vanilla in this case

i will not compare csii with cs as they are two very different games and cs had 8 years time to get new features bug fixes code mods and assets therefore these two games have a totally different base to work with

csii is completely new coded  not simply reused code that got polished a bit and be sold as a new game it is a new game

we all know csii struggles right now with the performance but being involved deeply in the testing i know that co is working on this  as they already stated in their very open announcements would it have been better to postpone the release abit from a consumer point of view most likely but is it a bad game is it horrible coded no not at all it absolutely needs performance tuning no question but this says nothing about the game core mechanics and these define how enjoyable a game is in the long run once the performance issues are fixed

because of this ill write about the good core mechanics the game have and that are a solid base for former development

the simulation handles many aspects of a realistic simulator in a good way  eg industrial areas warehouses are automatically build where they are needed and this smoothes out the traffic in the areas a lot

the bpainting of industrial areas for farming livestock and so onb is a great base adding different textures in future will make this even nicer looking

the btrafficb itself  bincluding accicdents and rush hour systemb is manageable and the pathfinding in most cases is already very good tweaks will be needed to make the lane switches in last second appear less often  just as in real life their should be still people driving this crazy

city services like bfirefighter and police work over all goodb sometimes not enough firefighter trucks are sent out but this can be optimized later wo too much work adding later animated police officers firefighters and others doing there job would make it ofc looking more realistic the district city service options are good working too

the bmilestone and unlock systemb is imho a good way to direct the city the way you want and i can see here options to add way more things in future

the broad builder is one of the greatest toolsb in csii  even though it have a steep learning courve to master all functions and need some additional options force ground elevated bridge tunnel and handle zoning are imho the most important ones the road update tool to add grass trees and walls should use multiplyer keys to eg update a full road only with a few clicks and there should be an option to have grass and trees in one selection instead of two update steps

the bvisual style over all i like  its a bit too clean in my opinionb but thats nothing that is unsolveable better grass textures esp for the road upgrades also better textures for the water used in assets fountains are absolutely needed to make these matching the overall style trees on road update should have tree planters  tree beds if no grass is used vehicles should have no snow on their windows deciduous trees should not only be white but lose their leaves make them invisible in winter all these are just smaller optical things that would enhance the visual experience a lot

the bcity and district policiesb need more options but  the ones bavailable atm are a good startb

the bupgrade functions for various buildings are greatb and i like them a lot i hope there might be ways in future to have them even detached from the main building in a defined distance

the bterrain tools are also very strongb and free of cost  a hard mode with cost i would like to see later as well as the btree brushb while the latter still bhave a lot potentialb  eg mixed tree selections

what i like at the assets is eg that the bvehicles drive correctly into garagesparking lotsb as well as the fact that the bentry and exit of buildings not get blocked by parked carsb

the bphoto mode is greatb it is an massively powerful tool and the only wish i have there that there should be an option to use specific settings directly in the game play eg light changes to have way more oportunities to create different looking cities as it is not nice to build with different optical settings then doing the screenshots

i like that a lot of bbuilding are really largeb eg the train stations but i woul like to have there even more modularity also more variations in the city services buildings are needed only one elemantary school that not even matches a general european stile is not satisfying i see that pdxmods will help there a lot but imho co should deliver there always a basic selection of two or three alternatives per style

hrhr
h2to summarize h2

h3positiveh3
 good core functions as a solid base for future and long term development
 overall good simulation
 already good road builder
 great terrain tools

h3negativeh3
 the actual performance at least with changed settings its possible to achieve 30fps that are enough for a city builder
 optical various small details are missing that would enrich the game
 not enough variations in service building assets

h3neutralh3
 missing workshop but pdxmods is in development

good game base with a lot of potential to grow within the next few years  to be a very successful successor of cs

in my opinion it is worth buying the game if you want to play a realistic city builder that is not too hard to manage but offers a lot of features and if you are willing to to wait for the further development of the game to get better performance add more functions and become more polished

#####

so far the game is amazing yeah the optimization isnt that good and theres stutters every now and then but if you tweak with some graphical settings your game will run perfectly fine at least for me playing on a 3060 ti with an i7 12700k and it runs pretty well

optimization aside the game itself is amazing like i said and has very good building mechanics road tools are excellent and the new terraforming tools feel like butter

i recommend this game and i dont feel like it deserves the hate its getting at the moment since if you just tweak some graphical settings your game will be beyond acceptable and playable this is proof since my friend has a 1050ti with a pretty bad cpu and is running the game just fine some people just dont know how to change their graphics settings get used to it and stop whining

#####

h1 honest cities skylines ii review h1 involves majority of the dlcs from its predecessor with some major improvements and some not so favorable optimization overall i really enjoy the game with all the new features and management of you city from the ground up lots of mods that were available for cities skylines have been integrated into the second generation 
road building and structure placements have been made way easier to move with a new system for citizens to determine the most efficient way of transport depending on peoples needs turning your city into a bustling metropolis 

h3 the downsides h3 so far for me has been some of the industries as that was my favorite expansion of its predecessor the industries are easier to layout and forget but i enjoyed some of the management of it and the realism of the first on in cities skylines ii i think the resources should be reevaluated as a lot of canadian and american cities are built from oil and gas or mining sectors you will run out of resources in a area before your city can even reach a high milestone in which you need to redevelop your sector somewhere else i would like to see the ability for unlimited resources or a more accurate consumption rate with variety of assets you can invest into these industries

the main issues people have had with this game is its optimization my pc has handled the game fine with some tweaking of the settings as you have to do with most newer titles as time goes on i hope more people can actually enjoy the game as i do

i am offended you all think that charging 4999 for unoptimazed garbage is ok what am i supposed to do play photo album this is madness refunded and i will never buyfull price even when it is fixed what a joke


#####

massive performance issues aside the game feels more like a knockoff imitation of cities skylines made by some sketchy backalley developer than it does an actual sequel from the original developer and publisher

i neither hate the game nor regret taking vacation from work to play it at launch but its definitely another example of a game being released for an arbitrary deadline before it was ready

im reasonably certain that in time many of the performance issues will be addressed well enough for a multitude of people who are complaining about performance right now to be able to play the game decently well

what worries me though is the way colossal order redesigned certain mechanics of the game versus the prequel  i appreciate certain levels of complexity and detail when building my cities and the developers definitely tried to add layers of both to a great many aspects of cities skylines ii obviously taking inspiration from various mods from the first game for several features  but for systems that were i presume built from the ground up with those inspirations in mind they didnt seem to do a very good job at integrating either those inspirations or their own new ideas into the mechanics  so what were left with is in my opinion a lot of game mechanics that function too complexly for too simple of end results  and as these seemingly halfbaked systems are core elements of the game andor its engine im honestly not sure how willing or able the developers will be to modify tweak or outright change them to make them play better  

perhaps with time i will become more accustomed to the altered mechanics of cs ii and learn to appreciate them regardless of whether they get changed from their current forms or not  i know it isnt exactly fair to compare a brand new game on its launch day to a game that has something like a decade of constant development under its belt but is it wrong to expect a certain level of refinement from the very people who undertook that development  

hopefully this game will eventually grow into the shoes its trying to fill and we can leave all these launch issues behind us and look forward to many years of watching this game grow into something that surpasses its predecessor  but for right now it feels more like a step backward than it does a step forward  this and the aforementioned performance issues is why i cannot recommend anyone buying this game right now  wait a few patches and pick it up when the reviews start to turn positive  its probably better if you wait and buy it after it gets fixed rather than buy it now and let its disappointing current state taint your impressions and possibly keep you from coming back to it later

#####

while needing polish and performance improvements so many of the fundamentals are dramatically improved in this sequel

#####

a great many reviews so far both positive and negative seem to center around performance while its definitely true co shit the bed a bit here for most people these issues are fairly surmountable if not still having enough annoying present issues like stuttering for those same users so i feel compelled to counterbalance that by listing an assortment of the the much deeper shameful issuesannoyances in this sequel

 the improved traffic pathing would really be more appreciable if the lifepath of cims seemed to matter all that much there are distinct periods of high rush hour and low utilization but in terms of actual behaviors cims interact illogically park at location very briefly before leaving immediately sparingly or often not at all
 i know this is a complete rewrite of the game compared to cs1 but how exactly did water physics manage to regress this badly relatedly dont waste your money on a hydro dam as it appears to be wholly nonfunctional for power at this point
 or do waste money on your hydro dam because it actually doesnt matterthe game economy is opaque at best and nonfunctional at worst im not sure if people are correct in reporting a complete absence of logistics mechanics but it seems like colossal order have so little confidence in this area of the game that businessesindustries can get by on an excess of goods being teleportedfreely spawned in their inventories while also potentially suffering from a lack of customers and continue for an incredibly long time without ever going out of business ive seen a couple people successfully export goods but most people report their airseatrain cargo connections never loading a single thing while other people report businesses that have no outside road connection whatsoever still remaining in business so something is seriously broken in all of this also good luck getting your commercial plots to ever level up with their ceaseless moaning for customers
 you will frequently struggle to maintain a surplus probably due in no small part to economic silliness for most people they probably are overbuilding services but it is regardless more difficult than it probably should be not to worry though co have effectively papered over this by giving you particularly sizable cash bonuses every time you level up in the progression system unless youve been running a deficit with no profits and few milestones for a while youre unlikely to ever end up in a pennypinching situation this was also true to a large extent in the original game but that was more because the economy was easy rather than due to it being fudged
 dealing aesthetically with lotsroads on terrain in cs1 was never especially fun yet here we have also managed to regress massively from ugly to looks like a geometry error even if its not actually building on terrain has gotten worse mechanically in general as well twice as many slope errors and twice as easilysensitively quaysbridges yelling its in water at the drop of a hat for infrastructure literally meant to be proximate to water even if you get a road right on terrain theres a good chance you get stuck with a disgusting retaining wall setup etc
 cs2 got us all excited for increased ability to build noncardependent cities in contrast to the original then what we get instead besides small ped paths that work similar to the original is a single type of ugly wide pedestrian street that pedestrians dont properly utilize maybe due to aforementioned issues with their daytoday behavior but cars do love to utilize lmao especially if you zone commercial along it like one normally would do with pedestrian neighborhoods a lot of those commercial lots will end up being gas stations too i almost cant be mad at this one because its so whimsical
 further frustrating your plans for a beautiful modern and sensible urbanist city plan is the fact that it is remarkably difficult to ever push your cims into utilizing the public transit you very considerately built for them not impossible but far more often than not youll see marginal utilization on decent routes also remember how i mentioned ped pathwaysstreets in your quest to wean off car dependence you wont see a single bicycle on said pathways maybe thats just me personally taking offense as a cyclist but its yet another inexplicable regression from the original game
 roads are as everybody have noted massively improved in almost every practical way yet often beyond what a seasoned player might expect snapping is all at once too weak and too strong depending on context zoning plots becomes a planners nightmare as youll draw out a grid that is composed of perfect 90 degree angles and still get misaligned plots between the roads
 expecting all dlc functionality to be in this as sequel is not realistic butim gonna use this word yet againthe absolute regression here in campus areas park areas district zone specialization besides industry etc is pretty gaping
 on release of the original basegame the hypedup districtcity policies system was a little underwhelming as far as what you could really do with it and it was only after several dlc that the policies menu had any flesh on its bones it looks like an absolute abundance compared to the 6 or 7 policies theyve given us here lol
 ive made peace with the decision to not use steam workshop in favor of stillunreleased paradox mods but that doesnt mean i dont still think its stupid and as an imposition upon this game its just another feeble gasp from the increasingly frail wheezing body of paradox interactive ever since they went publiclytraded
 other cosmetic gripes there isnt even a tasteful fog to obscure how ugly the borders of the playable map are all vegetation and any nonsea water like rivers and lakes suddenly visibly do not exist beyond the playable boundary as do roadsthey couldnt even bother with something that kind of resembles a road going off into the distance the really funny thing is ive seen on the tampere map at least that trees can still render beyond the playable area and some scatter into it for tree clusters on the borderlines they were just too lazy to add any garnish to this area otherwise which doesnt really make you want to make use of the nearby playable area lol
 death by 1000 cuts so much across both major and minor functionality is either practically inoperative fairly broken or at least a little brokenunbalancedinconsistent including
 postboxes dont really seem to work the postal system does i think just not postboxes theres a lot of issues in other systems that are flatout silly just like this
 roadnaming and what the game considers a distinct road is all screwed up ive had entire grid neighborhoods have 80 of said grids roads considered one contiguous road and if you build off a road you never know how radically the game will shift what it considers to be part of the old road or a new road entirely custom road names are not protected in this process and you will lose your custom names extremely easily at this rate id rather just pretend road names dont exist anymore and hide them but hiding labels is not an option which it was in cs1
 seasonal cycles cannot be disabled and you cannot simply go to a climate that does not have seasonal cycles because all mapsmap themes are in temperate northern hemispheric climates anyway your winter wonderland will quickly become a snowy nightmare

textbook definition as of this writing for a mixed bag some parts of it are head and shoulders above cs1 the ease of building out cities and mapping out roads and transit has never been easier and its the most enjoyable part of the game by far looks nicer some ui is well improved theres a lot of lessons learned

but theres sooooo much missing and theres so little in the way of making a city feel like its organically growing and evolving at 100k pop every city sort of ends up looking the same and growth feels static because the rci system is not where it needs to be the way demand for highdensity housing is managed is poor and theres no way to plan a city to make use of it a lot of this is tied into how economics in general are calculated which is that the higher your education the higher the cims salary which is a sort of monstrously ignorant way of calculating either 

theres so much room for improvement but its also a sequel this stuff should have been sorted already im excited to see where it goes given cs1s lifespan but man rough start

#####

i mean i cant speak for others but my nvidia 1050 handles the game just fine without lag on low settings not even the lowest settings just regular low settings game had a lot of improvements compared to cs 1 that we saw in the trailers and i find it annoying that the grid tool doesnt integrate well with already built sections so i found myself manually drawing roads which has some other issues but i am still kinda trying to figure that out since the snap system is different and i like how they added ground water and air pollution so far ive just been messing around trying to figure out everything by myself as i go but there is a tutorial as well for new players which is more than cs1 had to memory

#####

whoa played 10 minutes first crash and really bad lagging this game is really far from complete maybe in year or two its playable dont buy it

#####

it pains me to write this i was so looking forward to this plus i shelled out 60 bucks for it but nah
in a nutshell its all just show  its not really a sim more like building a huge city of pixel legos  planes trains automobiles ships and pedestrians are just for show  its all show nothings actually does anything hopefully this will change hopefully

#####

i got early access and put in over 150 hoursin vanilla if this game was bad i would not have this much time put in such a short amount of time ive not had this much fun playing a city builder since sc4 the frame rates are better than cs1 and i cannot go back after using cs2 road building tools which makes anyone who ever struggled making intersections in cs1 feel like a pro and its not cartoony im looking forward to when modding begins which i believe will take this game to a whole new level if you liked cs1 you will love cs2

#####



#####

no lags on my side running the game on high settings i did follow the optimization blog post and turn off a few option like motion blur but who like motion blur anyways

anyway ive played a couple of hours the game is refreshing and the tutorial is self explanatory enough nothing to crazy veteran of cs wont understand im still at the very begining for now so i will update my review later but for now its very promising 

#update after a few more hours city grew bigger still no lag in sight except maybe a very slight frame drop when you wanna place a large building like the cemetery but it goes away once you place the building in question or cancel the blueprint

#####

even with dev recommendations it maxed out my 4080 and the graphics dont even look good my fps was decent but honestly the first city skylines looks cleaner id rather just play that disapointed what is maxis up to these days

edit after this initial review
i do like the core ideas in this game and can see a lot of potential they need to fix the optimization yesterday soon as they do i will probably recommend this game even though i hate they wont have steam workshop

right now though just wait if you dont  have at least the recommended requirements of a 3080 and 12th generation cpu which is insane given it doesnt even look that great graphically the design of the gameplay and functionality is premium though

#####

all the little details which made city skylines 1 unique are gone
no people in parks or on football fields no fire rescue animations no ambulance animations
what about police getting out of their cars and other cute stuff like that

the performence is also very bad a shame to release it in that stage

i hope this will get fixedadded soon so my review might change to positive one day

#####

so they are already releasing dlc except the game is in a nonplayable state

wish i could refund this product

#####

the game reminded me on how it felt to play on a slow crusty computer

#####

150 pm crash
155 pm blue screen
205 pm blue screen another one
220 pm blue screen scores again
230 pm crash 903
with my fucking rtx 4090 and i9 13900k on low settings only had bsod with this game thanks for this unique experience

#####

im getting around 20 fps on medium settings on a 100k population save game that you can download in the discussions page  motion blur depth of field volumetric quality settings fog quality settings and vsync disabled  dynamic resolution quality set on automatic  if i set everything on high i only get around 10 fps  

i have a i7 12700k cpu rtx 3080 64gb ram  a 3440x1440p resolution monitor and the games installed on a ssd  

its very disappointing that the game lacks proper optimization and is very frustrating to play with such low fps  as much as i would like to support collosal i bought the ultimate edition i dont think i can when they release a game in this kind of state  ill just wait for a year or so and hopefully by then they would have fixed the game and ill buy it again  for now ill just refund on steam and play it on xbox pc game pass because i feel 2 is what this game is worth at the moment

#####

the occasional slow fps having to lower the graphics to make it playable no props or even a line tool for trees and the fact i have to turn on autosave every time aside this game is just so much fun the tools and the way it plays are just absolutely too good for me to even consider going back to cs1 i have so many hours in cs1 so many assets downloaded but the fun i am having in cs2 is unmatched the photo mode the level of detail its all just so gorgeous i want to stare at it for hours im so so proud of the cities i build in cs2 and the tools were given to make such fantastic regions are unmatched once this game is fully optimised and they start releasing updatesdlcs that add to the experience its going to be immaculate 

i feel very very sorry for the devs on launch as to call it a bumpy launch is an understatement i appreciate their transparency and their honesty and i am grateful that i havent had anything gamebreaking happen to me in the 88 hours ive played since launch ive had one crash to desktop thats pretty good going for a game thats not super well optimised and one that im constantly having to figure out what settings work best for which map i cant wait for this game to reach the potential it promises and since i received this as a gift for my birthday i cant say if i feel its worth the money currently but i definitely cant stop playing it

#####

best slideshow i have ever purchased


#####

running well a couple of bugs here and there but not the train wreck people are trying to make it out to be a good improvement over cs1

#####

game performance is unacceptably bad even on highend machines you wont be able to achieve smooth gameplay

developers state that they were targeting for 30fps and that for a city builder game you dont need more but we are not in 2012 and it is not up to developers to dictate to us what game performance we should want people are spending a huge amount of money on highend pcs to get 60fps in whatever game not to mention that 90 of gamers with midrange machines expect more than 20fps

there is nothing in this game that justifies such requirements graphics are beyond bad detalisation is poor lighting is poor lots of shadow glitches and that aliasing even on max settings for gods sake at least add dlssdlaa

do not expect significant improvements moreover it will get worse with each next dlc as it did with the original cities skylines

#####

ive been really enjoying this game is it perfect not yet i say not yet because the first game got nearly a decade of updates as well as user content i have complete confidence this will surpass the original within the next year and even in its current state it is still fun to play

take the relentless criticism with a grain of salt yeah this game had a bit of a rocky launch but people saying that its unplayable is very unfair and completely untrue being unwilling to turn down your graphics settings doesnt mean a game is unplayable expecting the new systems to work the same way they did in the last game does not mean its unplayable

#####

ive been a co and cs2 apologist since beyond release  preordered 6 months ahead  going around to this and that youtube channel and a collection of r to offer a counterpoint  a grand future awaits just as was the case with the original i said i still tolerated the current state of utter brokenness of the basic simulation  magic goods appearing and disappearing from businesses warehouses and stations  nonfunctional freight  massive traffic despawning  the fact that your most heavily dirty industrial areas are judged to be the most valuable land on the map which prevents further industrial from growing  traffic navigation identically idiotic to the original vanilla game  
today the announcement was made that a no more regular community involvement and b paid dlc has been in continual development since release or before  instead of fixing profound abject core failures theyve put parallel and perhaps greater effort into charging us to dump further complications on top of a flaming pile of broken mess

this is garbage  the head of co admitted to said garbage before retreating from her community relations role  garbage move  garbage dev model  clear statement of intent that the future is garbage  i have nothing left with which to defend this game or company  it is a rotting product  dont touch it with a 90 sale pole

#####

hey dont normally review products on steam and this is more of a helpful note to those suffering form extremely low fps if you set the dynamic resolution scale quality to constant it fixes the fps issues took me from 30190 

system specs i710700k
                       32gb ram
                       rtx 3080ti
hope this helps

#####

you need nasa computers to run this game 30 fps on high graphics

#####

game is not done as of 19032024
so wouldnt recommend buying it till they fix the game

#####

it has many flaws still but the foundation is solid already can recommend since devs are patching regularly and its much better vanilla experience than original

#####

requires optimisation and lacks many features of the original such as bicycles metro and train station variants transport hubs detailed industries and parks however what it actually does it does very well and furthermore i havent had as much fun playing a game a while despite all its problems

#####

tldr i 100 recommend cities skylines ii despite the optimization issues and some bugs the game has tremendous potential and even in its current state it is a fantastic city building experience

i felt compelled to write a review for this game especially after seeing unfair negativity surrounding this game both here on steam as well as on other social media platforms firstly i will state that obviously my experience with the game is not necessarily indicative of how anybody elses experience with the game may be

my review will be broken up into a few sections and give you a wellrounded view of what i found particularly good about the game

b performance b

this is the biggest area that most people have been unfairly bashing cs ii i truly believe the only reason people have been as frustrated as they have been is because the game is not running super smoothly in 4k resolution with every possible setting and effect at full quality heres the thing if you go into this game with the intention of running it at that quality that smoothly you need a monster pc i went into the game understanding that my own hardware is quite outdated and have achieved a stable and smooth framerate so i have been able to enjoy the game without any real complaints i have my game set to pretty much medium graphic settings and it still runs smoothly with my citys population passing 10k residents  i hope that the game does improve in its optimization as it would allow for even more seamless gameplay but i am willing to deal with what issues i encounter until those fixes do come one thing i have noticed is that the game consistently runs gpu heavy where my gpu is constantly running at about 94 usage for reference my pc specs are as follows
cpu  i7 6700k oc
gpu  gtx 1070 8gb vram
ram  32 gb
i am also only using a 4tb hdd for storage

b visualsgraphics b

so let me paint you a picture of my gameplay experience so far after booting up the game i settled on building on the twin mountains map as i had heard it was based on iceland and thought this would be a neat setting but also a good way to test the accuracy of the weather climate and daynight cycles the game starts you in june 2023 at about 0800 hrs so summer time conditions the weather fluctuates between the mid 50s and the low 20s just like in real life i left the game unpaused and keep building as i wondered when night time might come as in real life icelands summer nights are very short the sun did not set until almost 2300 hrs and quickly rose the next morning around 0230 hrs i was blown away at the attention to detail and the accuracy of these systems the rain effects are stunning cloud coverage creates realistic shadows over the city and the visuals as a whole are absolutely stunning even on medium settings the game is just aesthetically beautiful to look at

b gameplay b

i came into cs ii with about 600 hours of experience on the original right off the bat this game is a vast improvement over the original in terms of how it plays the road building zoning districting and terraforming tools are much easier to use and function seamlessly the new zoning types fit right in and allow for redevelopment in a realistic and creative way the only thing that i have felt underwhelmed with was the lack of props and ways to fill awkward spacesgaps between uses to be fair the original cs did not find a solution to this problem until the advent of the parks dlc years after the initial release so even then cs ii is not in a bad place with how things have been so far i look forward to the introduction of the map editor so i can design my own maps mods and new dlcs that will just add to the overall pleasant experience that i have had so far

b final thoughts b

i know many people have been less than enthused about this game many have been angry demanded refunds review bombed the game or outright bashed the game to oblivion online they have their reasons i am merely posting my review to give you a side that hasnt been talked about in that discussion i have a mediocre pc by modern standards and have been able to play the game just fine at 1080p i know that with time the review score here on steam will become positive given how colossal order has previously handled cs and made it one of the best games of all time i have faith that cs ii will become the best city builder of all time with all of its new features and innovative simulation functions

overall i would give the game in its current state an 8510 it is not perfect and has its bugs but is a great foundation with potential to get even better

#####

tldr  i dont have to have amazing fps just in case the policeman comes around the corner and shoots at me until they make a mod for that

as you see ive been playing for a number of hours and honestly im not having serious problems at this moment 26 oct 2023 im having a little stuttering and lod issues but its being worked on as we speak at maximum settings and a city with 100k people which comes in at 30fps close up 40 far away sure i have a good computer i9 13 gen 4070ti but im so busy keeping up with all the new mechanics on managing the city thats what the game is all about right city management and thats what really distinguishes this game from cs1 this is a very rich deep simulator 

i can understand the frustration if youre new to cities skylines but if youve been with cs1 since the beginning you know this isnt the final show i expect the evolution of the game to be similar to cs1 which experienced massive changes and improvement  it doesnt even look like the same game remember things like cartoony graphics and the wonky modless road tools back in 2015 we didnt even have nighttime  always noon 

if one thing is true colossal order  paradox work hard on their games for a very long time after publishing i expect this to continue that wellestablished tradition you can certainly hold off on your purchase if you wish but keep it in mind because there is undoubtedly much excitement to come hang in there friends and hold on to your hats

#####

had to refund after 10 minutes of playing is either unplayable at high settings or looks like a ps3 era game on low settings

edit tried it again with geforce now and with the stacked highend hardware it offers it is mostly smooth but i still cant give it a thumbs up for being released in this state

#####

fix the damn game we dont need or want any dlc unless the game is fixed

#####

the pipes in the game are very clunky so clunky i cant even connect the water pipes to the water plant

#####

excellent successor to the original tweak the settings a little as they are pretty aggressive by default and this will bring your system to its knees

#####

dont do it if you like modding and customization wait for modding support or buy the first game instead in its current state it feels like a free demo version of a full game first game still has lots of life

#####

lets ignore the performance and optimization problems and turn to the other issues

 zoning is a mess the system gives priority to older roads for zoning but if you only build a 2squaresize house at a square you cant zone the remaining inside cells from the other road the game punishes you if you try to be realistic in smaller details

 there is no simple undo key

 no bicycles

 however there are parking spaces they probably will use your parking lot but theyll disgrace you if you destroy it furthermore the parking lot creates redmax noise even without a car in it

 citizens keep complaining about healthcare even if the healthcare has capacity available

 you cant mute the bluebird announcements

 the news is repetitive on the radio

 you can control taxes in detail this was nice but you cant control the budget in such detail if you reduce the welfare budget you also reduce the police stations budget if i understand correctly this can result in a sin city scenario less welfare  more crime fewer police  more crime so once you build a welfare center you cant deny accessibility

 when you control the budget they dont tell you how much budget is just enough for your city lets say you dont want to invest too much in sewage and water you just want it to run efficiently without overconsumption you can play trial and error to find the sweet spot
 no placeable props

 the road is more detailed but you still dont have enough freedom to control it just a basic option to turn off autopainting crosswalks

 there is no hard or traditional playstyle option i dont want to get a ton of money every time i want to develop a remote village and fight for taxes let me do it

sadly im about to reinstall skylines 1 this is currently a demo version



#####

i love this game i havent experienced any major bug or performance issues since release day and i have been playing it quite a bit nvidia is suggesting low settings as optimal but it looks awful so i have it on medium with not really a performance drop but my pc runs a lot warmer  not a problem coming into winter for me

this version feels more like a real city i love that we can see the industries and what the city needs to steer you into the citys  development i am actually embracing mining and farming etc compared to cs1 where i just went for a towering metropolis i genuinely feel like i am getting a more realistic and next level city building experience its very cool that you can build food farms and lumber mills etc and you can see the industry that processes the raw materials and that one feature that i think could be more ideal is that if industry near the raw material source is more aligned with that production line eg industry that requires timber is more likely to develop close to tree farms i also hope that this can happen in redevelopments as well as in factories relocate to premises built closer to supply chain sources

i like the changes made to the service buildings and the accuracy of their size i really enjoy that they can be upgraded instead of needing to build the same buildings everywhere for example the large fire and police stations have a huge service area instead of needing each of the stations in every suburb

traffic flow is much more realistic and more dynamic with its peak time rush hours and lane usage that said as of now there are some traffic ai qwerks that need some work  like the 35 point 90 lane changes at intersections which congest traffic further along with an excessive amount of intersection uturns that said with enough planning you can work around these two annoying features there are some interesting traffic quirks as well which for me are just comedic more than a problem  like people walking along the sidewalks in very long tunnels surprised there is even sidewalks in such tunnels when a motorbike accident occurs the cim remains on the bike laying sideways on the ground until the accident event is over fire helicopters drop water on to tunnel fires through the ground and pedestrians and cars levitating back up to bridge roads if they come off during an accident lol

i love the heat mapping overlay for many things like pollution and ideal spots for commercial zones etc but i will say that sometimes there is so much visualisation that its difficult to see the heat maps i will also add here that underground works are hard to see due to the volume of information you are seeing on screen

the seasons are great but the extreme darkness of winter makes builds harder haha

off the back of coming from cs1 which has a litany of expansion packs and mods this can feel a little stripped down in many senses but honestly with bug fixes and more content this will be next level exciting times ahead

#####

edit at 20 hours
now that they have released two patches even with a city with over 80k cityzens my framerate with the settings i had when i was getting 2040 fps in a starter city i am now getting 4060fps my biggest issues at the moment are the amount of trash in my city it seems that no matter how many incineration plants i build theyre always full edit looks like 9th of november they released a patch to fix the garbage problems d

after 5 hours of gameplay id like to give this game high remarks for being what i expected ofcourse as everyone expected performance was not as you would hope the other cs2 to have counter strike that being at max frame rate at all times 

the fps was for me with a ryzen 7 5800x and rtx 3070 arround 20 to 50 fps i felt that was perfectly playable ofcourse i had to adjust the settings a bit to get that perfect fit for quality and framerate i prioritized factors like antialiasing and others while tying to reduce vram stuff like texture quality due to only having 8gb of vram i think the picture looked pretty a lot prettier than cities skylines 1 i think this is one of the most beautiful games i play 

i did also turn the simulation cpu setting to max and that might have affected me dropping frames now and then but as someone who loves simulation games my profile should speak for itself palytime i feel cpu bottlenecks are the best case scenario for a game

this game is a perfect excuse for having the kind of hardware i do have while at the same time giving me a reason to look at gpu prices in the future i know that if i get a new gpu itll be contributing to something and not just being a vanaty purchase

personally i love the simulation aspects of the game as someone who really enjoys infrastructure way too much everything from trains to houses to electrical grids this game is the perfect sandbox for me to be looking at the details of the inner workings of my city its not mandatory for my city to have radio masts but if they do the cityzens will thank me  for it theres also a level of microing you can do with low and high voltage power lines that i enjoy a bit like in oxygen not included but as with the radio masts its not really something youll get annoyed by in normal gameplay

i feel like this game has so many macro and micro simulations that it will keep me occupied for a very long time there will be a lot of small and interconnected moving parts that i want to learn how they work the splitting of the rci meter to more colours is a great way to communicate the needs of the city to the player the import export page is a great way to communicate what the city is lacking suburbanites noting that their rent is a bit high is a great way to reward the player for building more housing

with the more realitistc style of assets in less donut wans realistic looking consumer cars realistic parking daynight cycle with the agents driving at different rates at different times larger scale and upgradable services i feel this game deserves a 1010 from me personally

for the possible optimizations i hear the devs were going to focus on now to get the console releases out i hope they wont toutch their beautiful simulation to make that happen if they just find some optimizations to make the graphics run better then thats great i do love the way the graphics look i think this is the first great ray traced game after quake 2 rtx ive really played that i know of even though ive had rtx cards for like 5 years now it looks great and the artefacts of temporal antialiasing are barely notecable assuming your framerate is above 20fps d even then just for about 3 frames depending on your settings d also the lighting effects are great highrises make great shadows to alleys with the global ligting system the water looks great too

tldr
buy if u like simulations and you have a decent enough gpu to run it if you do the game is beautiful

#####

over eighty hours in and i can definitively say that in time this will be a great game it is standing on the shoulders of a giant in its predecessor a game which was severely flawed but completely rebooted how city sim games should be

dont get me wrong cs2 isnt bad it really isnt it just isnt ready

at first i assumed that there would be a number of minor niggly bugs the stuff that playtesters might have missed and yes co admit there are performance issues and they are working on these but the more i play the more issues im finding which should have been picked up by playtesters and if they were then needed to be fixed before release

my early general support for co releasing the game on schedule was more than a tab optimistic in my opinion the game is 6 months to a year away from being release ready and certainly isnt value for the launch price right now i consider this early access and the public are being bug testers

as i said the game isnt bad and there is a tonne of fantastic improvements over the og the road tools are a builders dream the extra residential zones add variety and control the clever way props are used to add variety to buildings the industrial  commercial  consumer mechanic is very intriguing and in time will add a lot of nuance to the game overall the general aesthetic looks good even if all the maps look a bit meh

there is stuff missing by omission some will arrive in dlcs and content packs and yes the modders will raise the game beyond all limits but things like there only being one category of industrial zoning means that you have very little control over these areas why dont we have light industry heavy industry smoke stacks and warehouse given the added control in the other zones this seems a ridiculous failure

so the devs are going to need to be busy and i mean really busy all the upcoming dlcs are going to be wasted if the foundation game is not up to speed and right now it simply isnt for example at the time of writing rail and harbour cargo hubs do not export yep you read that right my city is losing money because my expensive industrial complex cant sell their goods the only solution i can see is building more power stations and selling excess electricity  which frankly isnt the sort of city i want

i will happily amend my review in a few months time when the game is in a fit state to recommend to a nonloyal player but right now you are better off spending your money on something you can enjoy now

meanwhile i will continue to play and produce tutorials so that ifwhen you return the guides are there to help you

#####

my grandma runs better than this game

#####

palm trees are dlc fuck you

#####

after the first couple of patches im finding it much easier to play and more enjoyable there are still several significant balance issues relating to ageseducationchildren issues with rent and unemployment and household sizes

im actually running a couple of rebalancing mods that have made it more realistic and playable id recommend you start out with three specific mods population rebalance economy rebalance and historical start unlocks rail shipping and farmingmininglogging these have provided better gameplay and smoother growth patterns for me so far

#####

cities skylines 2 fails with outdated graphics big performance issues and boring gameplay with 1530 fps lock compared to first cities skylines its not worth that much money at its current state id rather wait until they fix the problems before buying it

#####

runs worse than cyberpunk 2077 did on release

#####

this game is in a terrible state even without any buildings or extra roads built it lags when moving the camera or zooming in or out on low graphic settings embarrassing

#####

nobody should release a game that runs this bad
the progression system is doing everything to stop you from growing an organic city
all service buildings for some reason have massive parks around then seems like the only reason is to take up more space so your village will look bigger than it needs to

#####

shocked and saddened that the game was released in this poor a state i take no pleasure in saying it as i was note the tense a loyal co customer but releasing paid dlc when the games known sometimes gamebreaking bugs still havent been addressed in the several months since release is inexcusable

#####

like its predecessor bcities skylines 2b is an enormous sandbox in which players can build the city of their dreams  or nightmares  from the ground up you can play with finances enabled which means you have to keep an eye on your budget and will be limited in your possibilities or go wild with unlimited funds you can also disable the games progression system in case you want all advanced building options right from the start in a regular game you unlock points as your city grows and invest them into whichever options you deem necessary for example the construction of a subway system usually needs to be unlocked by progressing through the tree for public transportation but if you want your dream city to include underground trains right from the getgo then the game affords you that freedom

in terms of toolsbcities skylines 2b has vastly improved on its predecessors options partly by including popular communitymade solutions entire suburbs shoot up from the ground in mere minutes thanks to how easy it is to lay down roads which contain water and electricity lines now roundabouts can also be built right from the beginning it helps thatbcities skylines 2b comes with fantastic explainers for each system the game has to offer so even players without any citybuilding experience will be able to enjoy their time you can look these little ingame guides up any time you need them which is neat

in addition to your regular housing business industrial and office zones you can create special economic zones in which you can construct farms mines and other resource producers  if the areas provide those resources of course sourcing coal for your power plant or oil for your chemical industry locally will greatly benefit your citys economy but you can also export goods this is possible due to a new feature of bcities skylines 2b  outside connections

youre no longer isolated in the world roads train tracks and seas lead somewhere else now opening up new possibilities to generate profit for example you can sell off any surplus electricity youre producing to boost your coffers or forgo power generation entirely and just import energy is a hydroelectric power plant incredibly expensive yes itll allow you to export copious amounts of electricity though in addition to powering your town without any emissions that cause health problems

bcities skylines 2b features dynamic seasons so snowfalls can happen even if theres no snow at the beginning of your game and a muchrequested new hybrid zone that contains buildings combining residential and commercial functions  such mixed housing feels natural especially for the european theme speaking of which you get to choose between a european and north american theme once again which changes how buildings signs and vehicles like ambulances look and sound but has no gameplay impact

contentwise any veterans of the first game will probably feel a bit restricted after years of playing with dlc and mods  its the whole civilization phenomenon where the new game feels like it has a little less to offer than the previous one which had years of support behind it due to bcities skylines 2bs overall improvements i dont think this is going to be a prevalent feeling

even in this subpar technical state bcities skylines 2b is a potent and captivating sandbox thatll see the hours fly by as you engage with it its a worthy successor to the title that dethroned the mighty simcity and will define the genre for the years to come official as well as modded content will surely supply players with even more toys and tools in the future

bthe goodb
 massive visual upgrades
 cities feel more alive than ever
 complex building mechanics are now very intuitive and easy to use

 performance might be an issue
 the game needs dlc and mods before it can reach its full potential

ive finally hit milestone 20 in a city so i can give a review of the full gameplay experience
in its current state i cannot recommend playing cs2 over continuing to play cs with mods

the games got a lot going for it and is certainly a worthwhile standalone product it fundamentally stays true to the vision and gameplay of the first game but with many of the mechanics having been overhauled or reworked in a novel way i love the freight cargo lines and road tools which offer much more precise control over how cargo and traffic flow through my network i love the milestoneprogression system because of the agency it gives me in what i choose to unlock the maps are huge specialized industry is so much better than the first game

however theres many issues with this game as it currently stands progression past milestone 10 is utterly pointless the game suffers from major performance issues and the simulation begins to break down around milestone 15 buildings will intermittently stop sending out vehicles when off screen editing public transit routes will take a long time due to slow pathfinding the zoning tool will lag and get stuck in a painting state which can result in rezoning half your city by accident beyond the bugs and simulation issues though theres no gameplay reason to progress past m10 you dont unlock any new buildings services or mechanics you merely receive increases to your loan cap which you probably wont need to take by m10 by m12 i found id unlocked just about everything i actually wanted for my playthrough theres no achievement for hitting m20 nor any ingame reward the aforementioned performance issues slowed the games tick speed so much that roughly half of my playtime in my m20 city 3040 hrs was just spent on grinding out the last 4 milestones by m18 180k pop for me triple speed time would result in about 15 seconds per ingame minute it really feels like the game was designed with 10 tiers of progression in mind and the other tiers seem tacked to bloat the amount of progression co can boast

the traffic ai is just as brainless as cs if i build a roundabout interchange vehicles will prefer getting off the freeway going around the traffic circle and getting back on over simply staying on the freeway vehicles all decide to swap lanes at the exact same spot causing massive traffic jams at major junctions and interchanges vehicles are super reluctant to enter traffic circles even when the lane they want to go to is free pedestrians acknowledge no higher powers and will cross where they please

the path info view from cs is gone this tool was incredibly useful for figuring out traffic flow issues allowing you to click a road to see the paths of all traffic whose paths include it i cant imagine why it was removed from the sequel

the lack of mods is what really kills the experience for me im baffled that co didnt pay more attention to the most popular cs mods wheres my parallel road tool why isnt the lane connector from tmpe in the game clearly players desire that level of control and why are they planning to use their own platform over the steam workshop maybe this is just bethesda ptsd but i fear they may be planning to introduce paid mods

overall i wish id stopped my playthrough after m10 but regardless having reached the final milestone i cant say i feel much desire to start a new city it makes me feel much more like booting up cs and checking out whats hot on the workshop

between performance issues bugs and half the games progression feeling pointless i cant recommend this game in its current state i know co is currently working hard at improving these issues and hopefully i can update this review to reflect a more positive take this game is so so close to being great and im optimistic that in time it will be

#####

early access quality for full price

#####

rx 6800xt  r7 5800x3d  30 fps

#####

i waited the whole year for this 

#####

i decided to play the game for some hours currently at 188 hours before proceeding with this review with the following result

despite the fact that theres still a good amount of negative reviews about the performance issues with good reason i decided to give the game a chance and personally i have had a generally good experience however with some issues here and there
in the first especially two hours of my playtime i did experience game stutter and three complete game crashes which wiped a good amount of city progress after i tweaked some of the game  graphical settings and put some of them into lower settings i havent had the critical issues with game crashes 
i do however from time to time experience a small stutter for like 12 seconds once in a while but thats basically it

furthermore i believe as time goes by the game will get even more updates and hotfixes to address these kind of issues

that being mentioned the game itself is full of an inccredible level of detail you really need to take everything in consideration when youre trying to expand your city its everything from air water  ground pollution to how to manage service costs including export and import possibilities

the level of detail actually makes the game very complex and maybe even overwhelming at first but when you have given yourself some time to figure how the game system works then its in my opinion super fun to have those things to keep in mind for your next city expansion plans

if you like management games and can accept the probability of not being able to play with ultra settings for now then cities skylines ii is still a candidate to consider to add to your collection of games

#####

who the actual fuck even reviews games these days 
unquestionably the best citybuilder ive ever played some d1ckweed from jvmag says and everyone whos played this will know that its as big a lie as vice calling starfield a masterpiece 

im wellaware that cities skylines have had sevenorso years of optimization bugfixes and general qolupdates and that this game is written on completely new code but i get 14 fps in the menu alone which is insane when i can play cyberpunk with every setting on extreme and still get 90fps yet even if they fix that theres a myriad of bugs and apparent glitches youll see from straight out of the game 

i used to spend hours with the terrain tool to make beautiful waterfalls set up massive dams overlooking my city and planting deep forests on the outskirts but none of that is satisfying to do here because damns arent implemented in the game and the terrain tool is abhorrently sh1t to use and doesnt even have half the utility it used to which genuinely makes me sad 

another thing is everysinglenode will somehow be blocked by another thing making snapping underground tunnels bridges electrical and waterconnection extremely tedious and sometimes downright fistthroughscreen angerinducing building grids makes me want to self ham 

aestheticswise this looks more like a simcitygame than the original youd think they fired the art team and hired intern on fivercom and if you were hoping to build a nittygritty sin ciityesque gotham of your own youre gonna have to wait until the modding community pumps out luts and assets that overhaul the entire game or just downright stick with the original title and set the weather to be foggy and rainy 


tldr its unplayable until the game is optimized they fix the poor terrain tools and somebody adds an anarchymod a disappointment that the community  hopefully  in time will fix with mods ill come back to this when performance is better and the modding community has had six months to play with it

until then ill just be pi55ed that i  once again  huffed hopium when another company that i love released a game that shouldve suffered another year of development

fcking publisher pr1cks


do not  i repeat  do not give colossal order your money in this betatesting cashgrab 


update jan 2024 
this game wont be supported by steam workshop which we all know means the mods will be sh1t full of microtransactions and the game will basically be unplayable for years as the devs continuously destroy the game theyve built to sell more dlc what an actual scam 

update feb 2024
i tried coming back to this garbage and immediately after having tried to make a grid  which i couldnt because apparently overlapping another road makes it unbuildablewhy the fck wouldnt it just snap to the road instead  so i uninstalled it again 
i fcking hate how they butchered this title 


its as if they want this title to fail 

fck everyone involved in publishing and peddling this sh1t

revision 2

 performance  graphics 
performance issues mostly meant volumetric clouds and resolution being the problem so reduced the resolution to 2k fhd just causes eye cancer on a 4k monitor as well as enabled amds upsampler well it runs smoothly with 60 fps now but damn it hurts the eyes aliasing everywhere kinda reminds of early 2000s games

the bad thing clearly its not just performance visually cities 2 has miles to go still it just looks plain awful when i zoom out not far just as much as you do most of the time buildings start to get transparent shadows flicker and basically it justs gets a huge mess strains the eyes looking at that

really bothers me this alone lets me think the game should have been postponed a bit longer as this really reduces immersion a lot and makes it tedious to look at

 gameplay 
while the game itself is the fun kinda city builder were used to you realize after some time that a lot of the mechanics simply dont work as they should for a relased game there are so very many small annoying bugs that you encounter along playing be it traffic jams because some cars got stuck in the ground and block the road road snapping being totally broken when you try to merge a new road into an existing one while at different heights  it just doesnt snap automatically all the time and if it does sometimes in very weird ways

besides the bugs lots of controls are unpolished deleting underground low voltage power lines is tedious you barely can select them building complex roads is exhausting so often things break and you have to delete and rebuild them differently for example i tried to connect my highway to a roundabout not a flat area i built the first connection tried to build the second one and realized that my roundabout was gone it just replaced it with a normal street

thats just a few examples of it just feels unfinished cities 1 surely wasnt perfect from the beginning but it feels like cities 2 really should have gotten more love from the devs it feels rushed


 conclusion 
while its playable and fun most of the time after only a few hours you feel exhausted the facade cracks and you realize it just has too many problems and issues and you begin to become sceptical like  is it really that my few commerce areas dont have enough customers in a 5k city or might this be yet another bug

co should have postponed it and rather released it once its more polished sure aint a mess like cyberpunk but it really makes you feel they wanted to cash some money already

i cant recommend it yet not for that price wait a few months until they fixed the core gameplay not just performance as everyone is talking just about that

#####

despite the criticisms im having a great time this game is barebones in its current form but already in its vanilla form it looks a thousand times better than a cities skylines 1 city with an intermediate amount of mods and assets the road tools alone make this such a better user experience than fiddling with road plopping positioning from the original

#####

plays like v03 priced like v10

#####

note to those talking about menu lag wait for the virtual texturing to complete changing graphics settings back and forth may restart the process so have patience and read the screen

however i still dont get why there are so many graphical bells and whistles when the core graphics dont seem sussed out one of the most if not ithei most rewarding parts of building a city is viewing it not stammering through a smeared and blurry version of it that only has seasons win 500m of the camera maybe i have an antiquated way of looking at things but i really dont understand why they got fancy w volumetrics before if im reading the dev logs correct sorting the lod system

highly disappointed at and worried by this attitude towards releasing a game but optimistically hopeful that thingsll get smoothed out in time

#####

ive been having fun so far nice new and refined old mechanics and no bugs except some minor inconveniences with snapping seeing all the hate bombing over fps issues i preemptively reduced some reflections and illumination settings a bit and it gives 3040 fps on average not good and not something you would expect from a rtx 4070ti but not nearly as catastrophic as some clickbaits make you think and perfectly playable and enjoyable for a city builder

#####

this is a hard decision to make yes or no but in its current state and price i can only say no  if it had been about half the price theyre charging for this then it would be a yes but i feel a bit cheated at this price

the game feels very beta like they didnt quite get enough testing in before release
to add to this compared to cities skylines with a whole bunch of dlc cities skylines 2 feels quite empty i feel like ive swapped an old ferrari for a brand new kia  yes the kia looks more modern and has a few fancy gadgets but its no where near as fun to drive as the old ferrari

bullet points of bad things

 garbage processing is very broken
 mail collection is semibroken you have to put a post box on pretty much every street
 education system figures might be broken especially for college level upwards
 subways are very hard to build
 road elevation changes are very hard to build
 bridges are very hard to build
 sometimes a building you previously connected with a road and has been working for ages suddenly decides its not connected anymore
 sometimes things cant be deleted or moved due to incorrect shape whatever the hell that means
 performance is horrible and yes i have disabled the things they advise to
 graphics dont look nearly as nice as i was expecting even when on highest settings
 a number of random crashes
 radio glitches out all the time and repeats the same news broadcast exact words back to back sometimes with the same character other times using a different one
 ports are much harder to build than previous game
 its really hard to tell which type of residential zone you have already laid down as theres now i think 5 different shades of green and when you click on the building it doesnt tell you which type it was

bullet points of good things

 progression system is really nice much better than before
 building variety is much better
 variety of road types is much better
 seems easy to make money even when youre loosing money due to rewards provided
 map is much better  bigger which makes things feel less cramped

#####

its an unfinished game and it take ages to be updated 

with barebone paid dlc

what a disgrace

#####

game runs about as good as my quadriplegic grandfather

#####

doesnt run great but aside from that its a general improvement on the first

#####

was having fun working on my first city no real performance issues and then my game randomly crashed and deleted over an hour of progress because autosave is disabled by default for some unknown reason

note to the devs if you know your game is an unstable mess you should probably enable autosave by default

for those on the fence about buying the game you should keep waiting for a whiiile

there are still a lot of basic playability issues and missing features that make this feel more like an unpolished early access title than a game that was fully released months ago unpredictable zoning grids awful visibility in certain view modes weird glitches that prevent you from properly placing and deleting utilities  the list goes on

i was happy to look past all that but the random crash has pretty much vaporized all of my interest in playing this game until a lot of changes are made

#####

a truly tragic loss for colossal order and for all of us gamers years of building up trust and goodwill ruined basically overnight its been almost 6 months since launch this game is exactly the same as it was on day 1  its bland laggy blurry mess with broken gameplay bugs and questionable simulation its not the worst game ive ever played but its not enjoyable at all

now after 6 months of waiting im happy to hear that they will release a new paid dlc next week yay and a radio station incredible stuff i think we might get this game into a working order in about 20 years at this rate keep at it co s

seriously though this is probably gonna be better in maybe a couple of years time if theres anybody left playing it and the studio keeps the support because im deleting this and forgetting all about it i understand you have your deadlines and publishers pressure but wow 6 months with basically no updates and then dlcs are still charged go  yourselves

#####

game was released unfinished now the devs blame players for being toxic and upset really not ok with this if i only do half my job at work i get fired the devs release an abomination of a game and blame the players for being upset seems like theyre playing the victim card instead of working on fixing the game

#####

 steam forum accepting suggestions to improve the game
 ask for the workshop nobody got and everyone wanted
 post gets deleted by moderator

198410

#####

the game was released way too early  lots of bugs and unfulfilled marketing promises the economic and traffic simulation is a joke the state of the game reflects the state of the game development industry fuck you

#####

i will just sum it up
is the game good hell yeah
is the game broken yup
is the game economy broken yep
is the traffic ai broken partially
did colossal fix the game since the release nop they mostly complained about the community
as long you got a good pc and want to have a small populated city you will be fine
otherwise wait a bit until they actually fix the game
i do not recommend the game rn because the game for me is not in a finished state


#####

buyer beware this game is a scam content that was prepaid as part of the ultimate edition and supposed to release in 2023 has still not been released and the game description has been edited to change the roadmap dates the developers are refusing to communicate with fans outside of promises that it will come eventually and have called the playerbase toxic and the ceos opinion is if you dislike the simulation this game just might not be for you

#####

it still has major bugs and instead of fixing them they want you to pay for palm trees

#####

feels like theyre holding out content to distribute over dlcs which should be in the base game

#####

i have been thinking a lot whether or not this game deserves a recommendation or not i have been playing it every chance i got and have been thoroughly enjoying the game nevertheless steam doesnt ask whether i like the game or enjoy it it asks whether i would recommend it and at the current state i wouldnt despite loving it and wanting to play more

performance is an obvious reason this is just what hits you as soon as you log into the game it is not unbearable but i do wish it was better i dont think asking for 5000 fps is reasonable but i would like to see my city even when i zoom out and not see black buildings and weird glitches this often i can enjoy the game despite the technical problems but they are really annoying

the broken economy is a big problem for me and although it doesnt stop me from playing and liking the game if it doesnt get fixed quickly i will get bored faster than i would if i could manage my economy properly right now the shops dont need any supplies and just generate income from thin air the industrial buildings are importing almost everything your excess specialised industry produce is not getting exported for money its really wild and this was one of the big promises of the game a good economy that simulates supply and demand and you have to calculate a number of things etc it is there i think it is just currently so broken you cant do anything with the economy even if you want to a huge shame takes out a lot from the game

and finally the crashes and all the weirdness that exists the game needs more time and at this stage it is very far away from what cities skylines 2 should be

if you havent bought the game yet wait until a few months and a sale then you get a fixed and much better game if you already have it you can enjoy it but there are so many broken things i wouldnt blame anyone for being upset that the game has almost as many broken parts as working ones i wish i was exaggerating on that point

#####

unplayable extremely poor performance when you build a road the map disappears scrolling is really laggy and clicking on anything there is a good few second delay 

do not buy at least until the shocking reviews improve due to patches

#####

what is it with new games running like dogs shit lately

#####

add multiplayercoop for this game
cities skylines ii has a lot of potential but its missing a key feature coop multiplayer imagine being able to team up with a few friends to work on the same city your friends work on highways you draw the street lines
it would add a whole new layer of fun and collaboration not only would it make the game more engaging but it could also attract more players to join in on the experience

coop multiplayer could take it even further players could compare their cities incomes or even connect their cities to trade resources this addition would elevate the game to a new level making it possibly the best city planner ever

while the game can be great as it single player optimizing it further and gradually introducing these multiplayer features could truly unlock its full potential
heres hoping the developers consider these suggestions to make cities skylines ii even better

1  collaborative city planning players can team up to plan build and manage a city together sharing ideas and strategies it fosters teamwork and creativity as friends or even strangers work towards common goals

2 social interaction multiplayer adds a social element to the game allowing players to connect communicate and cooperate enhancing the overall gaming experience

3 varied specializations different players can specialize in various aspects of city management eg infrastructure economy aesthetics creating a more wellrounded and diverse city

4 competitive edge friendly competition can arise as players compare their cities progress encouraging them to strive for better designs higher incomes or unique city features

5 trading and cooperation enabling resource trading or collaboration between cities encourages interaction and interdependence fostering a dynamic and interconnected world

6 extended replayability multiplayer adds a new dimension to the game extending its longevity by offering new challenges and strategies each time players collaborate or compete

7 incorporating these aspects into city skylines 2 would not only enhance its gameplay but also create a more engaging and socially immersive experience for players

edit 32724
they released the beach properties update and totally broke the taa unplayable as of right now because all the other aa options are super rough to look at it took me 5 seconds to notice taa was broken and was making the border grids and most of the ui icons like high rent etc are invisible unless zoomed way in on then they are visible but 90 transparent still my god can they do anything right anymore this has to be some kind of joke at this point how many months before they fix this i wonder probably whenever the next overpriced soulless dlc comes out


original review
 i rarely ever leave reviews think in my 4 years of steamin along ive left maybe 4 or so but colossal order is a colossal failure truly a paradox for those of us who played and enjoyed cs1 for so many years hard to fathom its the same team behind this game i am not surprised whatsoever 30 of the reviews from the last month have been negative they deserve almost every bit of it in my opinion most of the toxicity and hate as the devs like to call it is 100 warranted we have toxic whiny developers who somehow feel as if theyre the victims here
my damn good pc can hardly run this crap at a population of 10k even on medium settings without dipping down to under 2025 fps at times and thats if my save file can even last to that point without getting corrupted and crashing 510 secs after unpausing the simulation and no its not my pc like the cities skylines and paradoxcolossal order loyalists and apologists say on repeat like a broken record its this trash game still no mod support months later still has terrible optimization toxic developer attitudes that heavily reminds me of my ex girlfriend who was 2018s  queen of gaslighting traffic and foot ai is just terrible bugs galore the sim speed is a disaster particularly at higher populations it just never ends man i have 300 hours in this game spent nearly 150 of that on my last city that subsequently corrupted and went fubar causign the file to crash to desktop after 5 seconds of unpausing the sim no workarounds could bring that file back to life 2 months later i had just spentoops i mean wasted 150 more hours of my life to try another city which also just today corrupted and crashes after a few seconds of unpausing the simulation no mods this time fk this game playing with peoples time and money is a great way to make sure your company has a poopy stained reputation for a good long while if not for the thunderstore and those who tweak the files and add them to it this game would be even more unbearable and unplayable than it already is 2 cities i worked meticulously on with my limited freetime for hours corrupted gone crashing to desktop immediately upon unpausing in case anyone else is also having this issue ill tell you what exactly didnt work for meeverything
x removing all mods
x validating game files both times it reacquired 2 files but that wasnt the culprit
x launching in dev mode and removing all cars and peds before unpausing
x reinstalling the entire fking game
x updating and reinstalling drivers
x unpausing saving the game quickly then reloading that save
x getting beyond angry at the 2nd fked up file and violently punching my training bag for 30 minutes straight pretending like it was cs2 and colossal order
i have absolutely no drive or patience to ever try to make a 3rd city again ever its over for me me and cs2 are officially divorced and its father colossal order is a dckhead like in many real life relationships and in the same vein as real life colossal order received 70 and i got nothing but lost time and disappointment i wont be returning not even 8 years from now when the devs finally hell maybe not even then get this st straightened out im done

h1 no steamworkshop  no reason to buy this game h1

by the general trend all games lately are released unfinished and unoptimized i was willing to endure this wait for content updates and patches that fix all the flaws b but b to encroach upon something sacred  steam workshop because of console players who will benefit the most from the new workshop is assets is a real slap in the face to me and my colleagues in this game 

the esteemed developers apparently u forgot u what kept and still keeps the first part afloat and why is this game mostly purchased in steam and decided to remove the reason to buy it here and replace it with their own product which no one asked for 

yes the new road construction mechanics modular service buildings and updated public transportation route building mode are all great and bring significant improvements to this game but whats the point of a sandbox if there wont be a proper tool for its full realization b whats the problem with having two workshops b the feature of having two workshops is used in stellaris

as for optimization i wont say much because its something that can be easily resolved with a couple of patches but i havent experienced any issues on my 3080 and i7 7700k however the absence of trolleybuses bike lanes detailed construction of service and industrial zones and many other things which will likely be fixed in a year or two makes the game look like a car lobbying simulator litterally and its not worth my money especially since they doubled the price after the release interestingly about 75 of the content from the first part of the game is missing here

i have around 400 hours in cities skylines 1 and it seems like i will have just as many if not more because it is clearly better than what we are seeing in the second installment b if there is no steam workshop there will be no game in my library thats my stance b

#####

original review
i cant believe this game released in this condition after all the goodwill the community put into colossal order  paradox this was a launch on the order of spore not sc2013 bad but not far off this game looks horrible in literally any mode and barely runs in their ama they said 

    we just dont believe there would be a long term benefit in setting the target to 60fps
 what what world is this thatd be ok if it didnt run like hot garbage on the recommended specs they should have delayed another 6 months but i doubt that would have fixed the broken unity engine

50 hours in review
while the bones of the game are fine possibly even great the presentation leaves much to desire
  no rural train stations only oversized ones by default
  no subway interchanges
  no elevated subways only atgrade and below grade
  trying to realsize scale objects has instead made them way too large
  broken traffic simulations means that the funnest part of this game so far is creating picturesque commuter suburbs with good transit linking i call this mode new jersey simulator 2k23
 procedural objects and better ways to handle corners and 45 degree angled buildings should have been in the base game youre city is going to look half empty some 1980s bronx aesthetic if you will
  path finding ai can send cims walking do your train trucks like their gutter punks hitting a ride

while its getting better youd be better off coming back in a couple years ala cyberpunk 2077

update march 25th 2024
with their latest dlc they have shown their willing to go even lower not only is the dlc beyond poor quality a record low for them they have chosen to add foliage options to it exclusively by doing so theyre locking some parts of the game behind a paywall for landscaping just as things were getting better they did this oh and paradox mods instantly broke in the world of hyperscalable cloud services i have no idea how they managed this this is even more sim city 2013 than sim city 2013 now

#####

my fps seems fine

#####

what were they thinking the most important aspects of the game dont function and theyve started releasing paid dlc 

maybe in 3 years with 150 worth of dlc itll be playable what a scam

#####

if you like jest planes and jet engines get this game  guaranteed to turn your gpu into one my 3080ti sure did now i can be maverick

optimisation currently sucks and the game should have been either delayed or released as an early access  and get a huge red warning about the fact that it utilises 100 of gpu even on an empty map

when they fix it ill update the review but the practice of releasing totally unoptimised games or poorly optimised and counting on dlss to bridge the gap is abhorrent and a cancer of current aaa gaming

#####

i heard no steam workshop anymore what a fking stupid decision

#####

really unfortunate to see the developers current stance on this broken and buggy mess of a game from blaming the community to working on paid dlc before fixing fundamental gamebreaking problems its clear they have completely given up on their playerbase in favor of squeezing out every last penny from them the recent patch release statements are out of touch with reality and have solidified the future of this game i feel really bad for any content developer modder or map creator that was counting on this release

#####

has a lot of bugs no optimisation at all im getting barely 60 fps on medium with my 3080ti why release it when you delayed it for consoles just to get review bombed another bad 2023 release dont buy it

#####

putting all the graphics glitches and bugs the game was fun for 20 h then you realise than none of the things you do does matter in the game public transportation moving sliders its almost impossible to lose at some point its more of a challenge to go bankrupt than ran a successful city it feels more like a puzzle than a game dont regret spending money but its so boring and lacking of challenges that playing just doesnt make sense

#####

tldr this game is an alpha test of what may come in the future  i recommend waiting till 2027 for this one to ripen 


my top points

 every house looks the same in this game i mean all identical houses you can change between european and american but besides that they are identical the first game had so much variety it made it feel like an actual city this game feels weird in comparison 

 the public facilities are now massive too massive they dont fit the theme of a small town anymore they are all built for these massive towns it seems its all very strange and honestly bad game design 

 the radio that plays the great music that we come for now has a beyond annoying group of announcers that blare pointless jabber in your ear every 2 songs this you cant turn off and you have to just listen to them complain about the taxes every 5 minutes or turn off the radio all together 

 traffic simulation is better than the first but not better than the first with mods in comparison you can do so much more with the mods 

 the visuals are garbage i dont know how they did it but it looks worse than the first ive tried changing color formats and turning on and off hdr but whatever i do this game looks much worse than the first the lighting is very off putting giving it an uneasy feeling at all times on a ultrawide 4k screen the shadows and antialiasing are both awful its hard to describe but i think its due to the suns movement that cause a constant flicker on all objects and shadows even at max settings the first game looks incredible in comparison and runs much smoother 



theres more but thats enough for now 



#####

i cannot recommend this game to anyone right now there are too many issues sticking to cs1 for the moment i have specs above recommended but the constant stuttering and flickering made it a strain on the eyes i have requested a refund 
soo sorry because i was looking forward to the game and the new road tools 
please hold off of buying this mess how tempting it may be hopefully they will fix the problems

#####

no mods for console players not to worry paradox have the fix in cities skylines 2 no mods for anybody

plus its buggy dismally optimised and constantly crashes every single play session i have had in this game has been punctuated with and ended in ctds sometimes bsods in this day and age and my pc is quite the beefcake

ive never built more than a small city because it just gets frustrating as everything slowly grinds down into a laggy buggy mess  on my 64gb12900k4090

theres so much potential in here and i feel like theyve just thrown it away particularly on the mods thing

#####

2nd edit i preordered this game on october 11th i really believed that it was going to be a great game but it wasnt now my playtime is just shy of 5 hours trying different ways to get it to work and work well

now the preorder and playtime are working against me as steam wont honor a refund dont even look at this game it isnt worth the hassle

edit dont even wait for christmas i tried to play this after the 1st hotfix and nvidias recommended settings were released when i tried to take a screenshot of the notre dame which looked horrible btw it made my motherboard give me a cpu beep code

what that means is that it took so many resources to take a screenshot of a singular asset in a brand new map that it crashed my pc gonna fight for a refund it is not worth destroying my less than a year old pc please see below for specs



this is gonna be much like other reviews gameplay looks to be as fine as it can be considering the circumstances but the fps stutters caused by poor optimization make it hard to play i followed the recommended optimization by the dev team and at first the stutters were bearable the first time i played then i stepped away and opened my save file with about 1000 citizens a couple hours later the stutters were too much

for context my desktop has rtx 3070 i9 11900kf and 64 gb of ram going by paradoxs recommended specs my pc is just shy of the recommended there is no good reason to have to go any lower than high graphics with small tweaked settings it also has 8 fans liquid cooling and it ran up to 75 degrees celsius before even starting the game

i wouldnt feel comfortable even trying to run it on my rtx 1070 laptop which also falls well above the minimum requirements itd fry the machine

i have faith that they will fix it in the near future if for no other reason that they have to for their financial quota but until that day comes itd be better to hold off spend your 6090 usd on another game or a nice outfit or a date i wish i had

#####

the scariest part because i dont think its an easy fix is what biffa highlights in his youtube video b nothing matters b all these complex simulation systems and still nothing actually happens that you have to worry about unlimited money unlimited happiness traffic doesnt matter its so sad because this game had a lot of potential

#####

bugs are still kinda meh but its definitely fun with updates itll be great

#####

they ruined my favourite game

#####

wait until they optimize it  goes on sale it runs terribly right now and isnt worth 50 i truly love this game but the fact that they havent automatically set autosaves on means i lost several hours of work  please wait until mod support comes out too because some of the roadbuilding tools are hard to use and dont always do what you want them to

#####

6950xt  5900x  32gb  17fps 
this does not need a comment just wait

#####

2080ti  1440p with 16 fps in menu at high settings wtf is this

#####

unoptimized and buggy at launch as any other game in 2023 pisses me off and got tired of it already

here i will leave the cat friends who pass by can pet it and give it a thumbs up

this is a definite improvement over cities skylines

the two top things that put it above the previous game is the traffic simulation and the graphics

the traffic sim in cities 1 was what made me stop playing it i got so frustrated in the game being more about traffic than cities still a great game dont get me wrong
the next thing is the graphics cities 1 looked good but this game is a huge leap forward in pretty cities i dont know if i could go back to the first one

on the note of graphics i have to say the devs have been going to great lengths to optimize the heck outta the game in the time since i received my preview key  i have a gtx1070 kept a few graphics at high and was still able to stream with out too much stuttering maybe im just used to having slower computers so a few dropped frames dont bother me
the devs have a list of things you can turn off to help and i think it helped me out a lot let me know if you want my graphical settings i can get you a link to a clip of them

other than my top two reasons i have a bunch more things i liked but its a lot of little things like i really like the modular upgrades you can do to buildings now its like they took some of the best things from the disaster that was eas sim city and incorporated them into their game

there are a few nitpicky things i expect them to balance once the greater player base gets their hands on the game and give feedback a few buildings are on the large size andor ineffective incinerators three massive upgraded ones cant manage a small city aaagh while some seem a little too effective for their size one post office managing a super city if they are really problems and im not an idiot i expect paradox will balance it in a patch or something

even if nothing is changed i had quite a lot of fun and i find myself a bit addicted seeing that i put 25 hours into it is surprising game really sucks you in and is a very fun city builder for a wide range of city builder fans to the model city builders to the gamers to the dream city makers

#####

i am sure that this has been repeated ad nauseam in the reviews for this game but if it had not been for simcity 2013s disastrous release the degree of popularity that the cities skylines franchise has attained would simply not exist one would think that nearly on that games tenth anniversary it might be in mind for executives when determining a release schedule for their game

why did cities skylines 1 succeed where simcity 2013 did not simply put it was unlimited where sc2013 imposed limits there are many examples of this that you have probably heard before community content map size oneway roads yada yada why is it then that some the very things that helped spur the popularity of csl1 in the first place not the first priority in a full new release 

this is all stuff youve heard before what i have not heard nearly enough people talking about is that this game seriously lacks charm compared to its predecessors i admit this is quite subjective but hear me out like it or not the donut vans and obnoxious sirens of the first game are iconic and goofy and felt like they gave the game a charming identity an unrealistic identity perhaps but it had spirit it also had outrageous ploppables like the hadron collider in case you wanted to embrace your unrealistic side simcity 2013 lest we forget had quirky thought bubbles a poorlydisguised advertisement for progressive insurance the 100 electric nissan leaf the whole future expansion that changed literally every zone and on a more sincere note the most fitting music for a city builder that ive ever heard ever theres a reason why the simcity 2013 music pack for csl1 was popular no shade intended that is hard to follow up what is the identity of this specific game spasm electronics

i will give credit where credit is due the road system of this game is vastly improved over cities skylines 1 as are the building and vehicle models i prefer the zoning categorization in this game as it is a major step up in realism the north american style does feel pretty american anyone remember roads united and that whole fisaco roundabout support is very nice the tree growth and seasons are nice and adds value to every tree you place down 

the developers of this game are good people and i believe that they wanted to make a good and fully fleshed out game i believe strongly that they just needed more development time to create a proper sequel or they needed to release this game in early access like many others have already suggested one day i hope to revisit this game once it is in a more playable state but i am worried that it will never get there for me

#####

as my first city builder im really enjoying this game and they provide a wide amount of tools to allow you to build the city you want 

pros
 keeps you busy as your city continues to scale
 challenges to maintain your city change over time
 provides nearly every building you can imagine to build your city except public libraries
 plenty of tutorials to support players that are new to cities skylines 

cons
 game slows significantly after reaching 150k population 
 some parts of the game still feel like theyre being worked on
 some of the building designs are uninspiring 
 game crashes once in a while  make sure you have autosave on

lastly i bought the base edition and hoping that they offer a means to upgrade to the ultimate edition im surprised they dont already offer the means to do so 

im already enjoying this game but also looking forward to seeing the game further developed and more addons and updates become available

#####

cities skylines 2 is a disappointment as someone who has made over 200 videos on the game and who owes my youtube career partially to it its a slap in the face for paradox to release the game in its current state

performance terrible even the loading screen struggles with an rtx 4090 lod issues and bugs plague the assets and the detail in the game is completely inconsistent why even add a high quality setting if the worlds fastest gpu cant run it

content perhaps worse yes the road tools are way better than cs1 yes the simulation is more in depth but in my opinion releasing this game at a higher price than cs1 means we should expect the content from cs1 to all be present and im going to be bold and say i truly expect the last games dlc to be there as well  how else are you justifying the price increase the game feels so empty no disasters no bikes 

if youre considering buying this wait a while

#####

after hesitating on the initial release i finally took a chance and im fairly happy with the release certainly its not a complete game and comparing to cs1 is unfair since the previous iteration had nearly a decade to expand and continue development the skeleton is solid and despite some nuisance bugs i find that the game offers the same problem solving challenges that made the previous game so enjoyable with significantly improved road building i definitely want more from this game and im eager to see what comes next but as far as i can tell the only real problem with development is that its not happening as fast as people want if you are looking for a fully developed game with a wide diversity of buildings and addons come back some time later if you want to support the growth of a new platform with potential to offer so much more make the investment 

regarding recent anger 
there is clearly a lot of anger in the community which seems to be a growing issue with steam in general more and more releases have been garnering hostile reviews and calling for allornothing solutions all i can assume is that people are growing tired of buggy early releases and dropped projects its a difficult environment for developers right now and everyone is experiencing a change in player behavior with paradox and colossal order now being fairly well known players in the gaming world perhaps they are experiencing growing pains and the kind of leeway that players gave to youthful smaller studios is no longer something co and paradox can expect maybe people are making comparisons to larger studios that have also put out lacking titles for increasing prices we have already seen inflation in gaming as new titles on playstation have increased from 5060 to 70 yet games like cyberpunk 2077 the day before assassins creed valhalla starfield and other major titles have left a bad taste in peoples mouths 

to the teams behind colossal and paradox i find the game to be fun and engaging and i am excited to see what comes next please dont be discouraged by the public sentiment and know that there are players willing to keep the love going keep it up

#####

just play the first one and wait another few years for the alpha to be finished  sucks

#####

so i was reluctant on giving it a try because of the performance issues even before release and overwhelming amounts of user reviews but then i saw some people in discussions saying that all them whiners just didnt turn off the depth of field

thats why i decided to try it out for background here are my specs
intel core i77700
nvidia gtx 1080
48 gb ram dont ask
far from a power rig but i did manage to enjoy aaa games such as god of war cyberpunk 2077  rdr2 at high settings with at least 40 fps 

upon launch i was met with the notoriously bad in terms of performance main menu  mine was jumping between 7  11 fps first thing i did was go to the settings to turn off the depth of field like all the smart kids in the discussions do and yeah it actually boosted the main menu performance to a whooping 60 fps maybe theyre not wrong after all  i though

so i launched my first city on archipelago map before we proceed here are the settings i ended up with 
2560 x 1440 resolution
medium overall graphics settings
no depth of field
no motion blur
no volumetrics 
minimal aa

the empty map met me with 24 fps  a worrying sign but then as i started building the city assigning the first zones adding electricity  water supplies  my game was already dropping to 17 fps at an astonishing population of 3 three people

im sorry but thats not considered a playable game in my book i can only think of horrors id see at 5k population  god forbid 10k or more if you can endure this and actually have fun in the process  congarts youre a certified masochist im not judging

make of it what you want but i made a refund and waiting for them to actually optimize the game cause the potential for the best pure city builder of the decade is definitely there maybe in a year ill buy it again and will be able to actually enjoy the game

#####

i love modern gaming i love modern gaming

#####

i have over 1500 hours of gameplay on the original game ive literally been counting down the days until this release and i am so disappointed i guess we all have to have 5000 systems now to be able to enjoy the gameplay i have 64 gb ram a decent amd 7 processor and an 8gb gpu and gameplay is shitty even in low and medium settings not to mention visually at that quality it resembles simcity4 i have been playing since the release of the original nearly 8 years ago but sadly i think yall lost me over this 94 with tax for the ultimate edition and its virtually unplayable on my machine for context i play starfield with virtually no issues on max settings  make it make sense mechanics are clunky to say the least and the weird choices to change keyboard mappings from the original are just odd should have just kept improving the existing game i am actually uninstalling csii as we speak so very saddened you guys made a game for pros and developers not for your fans and it shows

#####

runs like a asthmatic hippy even on 1080p i can deal with the low fps but the game looks like a japanese porno 
pc specs
ryzen 5 7600x
32gb ram
rtx 4070
m2 ssd pcie gen 3

#####

the game runs smoothly at 60 frames per second in 1080p on my midrange gaming setup featuring a ryzen 5 5600x cpu an rtx 3070 gpu and 16gb of ram with the game installed on a pcie 40 nvme drive

initially i was concerned about the games performance based on negative reviews during preorder however i decided to wait and try it for myself to my surprise the game runs well on my setup

i believe the developers will continue to improve the game with future updates addressing any initial flaws and making it even better

#####

i regret i bought it at launch half a year has passed and cs2 seems an unpolished early access game on top of that colossal order doesnt communicate and attacks the fan base

dont buy it

#####

i got the ultimate preorder pack its been months and not a single thing they promised theyd provide with it has been released the trailers all made it seem like an ambitious deeply complex game its not its an extremely broken mindless game csii lied to me it lied to everyone and it took my money for it personally i would call that a scam do not buy this game

#####

if you want to spend time in this game i can only advise you not to do it at least not now
it looks great and have lots of potential but what we got here its cheeky 
basically unplayable without mods 
the balancing and the programming here is horrible there are bugs my friends and i have so you can think that no one has tested this game for more than 5 hours before
i spended more than 100 hours now installed mods so i can have a playable experiance but there is a point in this game something is to annoying and theres nothing you can do about it like the high land value

i am very upset about this game now because i love and hate to play it in the same way why we got so much games like this not ready to play but ready to pay for it this is an early access game for a full version not worth the money

wait for the game to be cheaper and ready to play 
its a testversion at the customer at the moment

#####

this game is probably my biggest disappointment of 2023  
as of march 2024 there are no significant patches fixing the main issues of the gamei wish i could just refund the game and forget that his game ever existed

#####

i played this game for 57 hours from the launch 
reading news from other website i set the game to a mix of low  mid graphic settings
i didnt experience any major lag but the game did crash on me once 
otherwise the main issue in this game is the balance

what kind of balance you might ask
well the first one is the density ratio 
pretty earlier after only few milestones you unlock medium and high residential density i place maybe two rows of medium housing and another two row of high housing
the medium housing all built but the demand never rose after after 23 hours of gameplay the high density built 23 building if at all
it will give you the office zone but its basically useless 
my town consisted of 80 low residential area not only that but it was only asking for more and more while nothing else was asked 
i was about to run out of space when i abandonned

the tax income ratio doesnt make sense either commercial revenue doesnt feel real for how much you will have 
house will have no residents as they died but are not set to abandonned or not sold either even if there is demand

personally i dont mind the low graphic issue even if it is annoying i was under the recommended settings before they changed it 
i really hope they work on it more and balance it

#####

performance issues aside the game is not done and requires months of work lets see how many dlcs they release before actually finishingfixing the game 
when its done it will be worth your money there is an amazing framework of what they wanted to bring us but not today

#####

while the game does have a few lag spikes once you get used to it the game functions well the highdensity residential demand is a little bit buggy and never seems to go up low density is always at the max though for the most part i would recommend the game as long as you have a decent computer

#####

everybody is talking about performance

my pc  i5 8400 geforce 3060ti 8gb 64 ram ddr4

5060 fps on medium 1080p

its just about settings copy from reddit post
optimal settings
dont go around reducing the global settings thinking its your only option a lot of the graphics settings have no impact on the fps while there are some key ones that have massive impacts

start with a high preset and then

use fullscreen windowed or disable vsync
disable depth of field mode
reduce volumetrics quality to low
disable global illumination
reduce the level of detail to low or medium if you dont need the extra fps
disable motion blur this is a preference if you want it keep it on low
in the advanced tab scroll to the shadows section and disable terrain casts shadows
if you want to squeeze a bit more performance disable fog quality though i personally prefer to keep it enabled

these settings should give you the best looking graphics while also increasing your fps significantly

so cya later i have a town to build love the game

#####

clearly unfinished very poor performance graphical glitches overall just feels like a mess
cities skylines the original has one of the most loyal fanbases of any games i know of who would have been more than happy to wait it out for a properly released product

#####

please dont listen to the negative reviews theyre horribly misleading and intended to drive traffic while the simulator definitely has some launch bugs theyre not nearly as bad as some of these folks are saying 

in fact dont even listen to me try the game out steam has a refund policy if you dont like it you know what to do

the best thing you could do if you enjoy these games is stop listening to people who are negative solely for the fact of driving traffic to their youtube and website or people who never play simulators and like to pretend that theres an incredible launch record for these games 

ignore the nonsense the game is legit fun

#####

they should have waited until the game was actually ready to release which it is not
big l for paradox
dont waste your money

#####

performance has improved to the point where i can now run on medium settings instead of very low resulting in a much more pleasant looking game there are also less random crashes now  i think the simulation still needs work the demand meter seems quite random and i wish we could decide the type of residential zone we want to build otherwise i feel like all cities will just look the same  i can however now give this game a positive review

#####

a testament to modern games

first release the game in an incredibly broken state from terrible performance the utter lack of  content inside the base game which we all know they plan for countless dlcs to milk as much as they can from it and the bugs inside the game which cause so many problems once you start to build a city of more than 10000ish people

second play it off as no big deal the poor communication from release until just recently in early march words of the week that gave absolutely no real information about the game or how things under the surface were done

third modding not having official modding support at release was the worst thing that they could have done and they did just that so many things that amazing modders in the cities community could have done to help fix this game in the weeks following launch but they couldnt to just now add modding support 5 months after release is a disgrace 

we all know that modders will be the ones that fix this pile of garbage that co and paradox call a game the newest dlc being 10 for a handful of house assets and 4 trees is just another sign that they dont care about the state of the game and lack of content just that they want your money

save yourself the money and buy something from a different publisher one that actually cares about making good games and that work on release


#####

paradox interactive is setting the standard on how to absolutely destroy a game developer do not buy this in its current state show them with your wallets

#####

i love the game and played for more than 200 hours
 i bought the game after release but after buying it and watching my brother play he prepurchased the ultimate edition i felt bad about not having any way to get the additional maps that are on it besides buying another copy of the game then i read about it and tampere is only prepurchase also after playing for so many hours and trying to figure out how to increase tourism i realized that i didnt prepurchase the game so i also dont get to use the landmarks in my city tourism is quite limited to only four buildings some that look ridiculous in my current city tbh this feels wrong specially on a game that had such a bumpy release cant recommend the game as it is right now sadly i hope the post gets some attention as id like these issues addressed by the developers not the community its a punishing newcomers
theres still lots of work to do specially if you build a city with public transportation systems hard to select each line hard to rename the connectionsstations or you try to build with tunnels avoid if possible inside a mountain youll need to slope considerably i played a map with considerable elevation and makes things quite complicated with the slope there are many things not explained an i think that the community will have to build guides around it also spent hours trying to build a dam it follows very specific conditions and you dont get any way to measure the output until you get the water at a certain level meaning most likely you fail except youre on a cascadewaterfall in one of my cities it didnt work because the river split the output of the dam was almost nothing when it had 200mt by at least 50 metres tall

thanks for reading the game is still entertaining and deserves a positive score eventually i admire the work put out its just some things are unexpected
cheers

#####

i am running this on a 2600x and rtx 2070 8gb 64gb ram 

i have clocked 12 hours in game today and have not had any performance issues at all i disabled dof motion blur vsync volumetrics and dynamic resolution any other settings perform absolutely fine on high my gpu has remained around 77c all day i have had maybe 510 moments when i pan quickly across the city or otherwise make quick camera adjustments where fps drops to 1015 all day i have consistently run anywhere between 2530 fps performance has been absolutely acceptable for me in a city builder 

the gameplay itself has been really enjoyable so far road tools are fantastic city service building models look great and i love the wider variety of zoning options

#####

if you dislike the simulation this game just might not be for you
mariina hallikainen ceo colossal order

well i love the first cs bought almost all of the content dlc  decided to support cs2 despite the comment above with faith that improvements are coming

the state of the game now its fine  cities grow and expand quickly the new unlock system is interesting and theres a lot of services and assets that come with the vanilla version that had to be acquired with dlc or mods in the first game assets are much more versatile and you can tell the groundwork for a great simulation is there

whats notsofine

visually assets that clip through the environment onramps that appear to dip under the grass pedestrian bridges with giant concrete walls that cims ghost through limited variety of aesthetic items like trees and props  optimization needs some work it gets choppy when things get busy on my midrange system i77700k rtx 3070

functionally  some vanilla assets are set up goofy eg some intersections have slower speed limits for the highway segment than the onofframps so cims take the ramps instead of the straight path  cims will disobey traffic settings eg no left turn turn anyway  import fees will jump up without warning if you have a deficit in something like furniture  all of a sudden your budget board is upsidedown and no advisor to give you a heads up  its difficult to track issues in your city without constantly checking all the info panels

overall it just needs more time in the oven  the simulation is for me it just needs to be finished

#####

kind of a how dare you feeling coming over me i supported you on launch it was awfulit still is youve not fixed the game yet but trying to sucker others in with a sale which is wrong for at least 2 reasons

1 people paid full price for your awful game and still dont have a working game give them a working game or give them a partial refund ive even had to go back to skylines 1

2 youre selling a game to new unsuspecting people by luring them in with a discount

shame on you

ps the game is so so bad please dont buy it yettheyve barely made any improvements and only hackers and crackers without any tools from paradoxcollosal order have made the game not break after playing for an hour its still bad and awful but without their work the game would lose all rico demand and your city would die

#####

colossal order is now a colossal joke they have really lost their way with this series releasing their first paid dlc while the base game is still broken is unacceptable also the cool new assets would have been things modders would have already introduced in droves oh wait mod support still isnt in place yet either as someone who was naively hopeful for cs2 and bought the ultimate edition this dlc is a slap in the face

#####

absolutely horrendous performance rtx4070ti i713700k and 32gb of ram and without touching any settings i am getting 20fps in main menu after changing some settings i am getting 6070fps in an empty city any additional changes which bump the fps to 90 make the game looks very bad eg blurred commercial buiding logos when zooming out the game can freeze for a moment the gpu usage is constant 97 rtx4070ti  even with those 70fps i have a feeling that after the city grows larger the game will be unplayable because of lags update 1k population  4050 fps it is a shame that it was released now because the performance makes the game unplayable and the game itself looks very good a lot of good changes compared to cs1 avoid the game until the performance is improved  it is a great game that is not working

#####

unacceptably bad performance 

4090
128gb ddr 5 ram
i9 13900k

update this studio is so corrupt that they have the audacity to release dlc for this broken ass glitchy game

#####

i am writing my first ever negative review to hopefully save other players 50 bucks on this game i had seen a few bad reviews discussing the outrageous computer requirements  one reviewer claimed that about 7 of steam players had a computer beefy enough to play this game others discussed slow frame rates i thought i would gamble and see if those problems were deal breakers for me  
1 this is the base game and it requires so much space i downloaded it fine from steam and then required more space i do love cities skylines but i have other hobbies i like to do on the computer 
2 citizens are screaming about crime i check the crime graph the whole city is good citizens are screaming about health care i check the medical center i have 5 sick people and the whole city is covered i looked this problem up in case it was a me problem it is a cities skylines 2 problem
3 always in the red  the services i need for my city cost too much month but i still required them  the ability to upgrade services is a neat idea but i dont know if it would be a good idea to ever pick them up really they are expensive to buy and maintain i do really like that concept
4 it is ugly cities skylines buildings were pretty to look at these are not 
5 the maps seem wrong there doesnt seem to have much thought put into them  maybe they are trying to encourage you to use the teraforming tools 
i am going to ask for a refund it might not happen as it is a little over their 2 hour mark but the bugs in this game are small but numerous hopefully i can get my 50 dollars back 
i hope i can change this review in the future but as for now i cant recommend it 
on the upside it did make me want to try to play workers and resourcers that soviet city builder game or reinstall city skylines the original a game shouldnt make you want to play another game and i will never preorder another game again

#####

what an awful release of a game i have faith in paradox and believe eventually they will make this game live up to standards i have a 7950x 3080 ti 32gb ram and i struggle to even hold 30fps on default settings 

this game is nowhere near a state where it should be released

#####

who wasnt happy when skyline 1 arrived after the downfall of simcity

but now paradox slips into the same shoes like ea before by destroying their own powerful franchise they are obsessive with shortterm profit stock value and investor happiness that both investors as well as paradox management fail to understand the basic rule of business keep customers happy

skyline 2 isnt worth a single cent i cannot recommend  it at all i would rather spend that money to short paradox shares instead

there are so many issues old and new alike its simply insane to release such an incomplete game without remorse

let me list up just a few of the experienced issues
 no kill button to wipe clean the entire city even simcity had it already
 symmetrical zoning is more complicated than before
 traffic rules are completely ignored by cars and pedestrian
 waterways generally make bridge building nearly impossible lack of proper compatibility
 tunnel entrance a visual mess and bug
 rail stations only attach to existing roads but not to existing railways
 natural disasters and traffic accidents require complete overhaul complete mess
 jets fly through tornado like it doesnt matter
 planes land on occupied runways and they just pass through each other
 no option to disable sidewalks or to stop pedestrians from entering tunnels or other offlimit areas
 hydro plant provides a street on it but cannot change traffic mode onewaytwoway
 hydro plant doesnt have emergency empty feature removal means flooding
 operating range of many buildings unclear not visible
 upgraded buildings cannot be adjusted requires to bulldoze and rebuy from scratch
 agriculture looks all the same regardless of grain vegetables animals or whatever
 mods disabled community cannot fix issues on their own
 new issues outnumber new features
 old issues outnumber few features
and i could continue the list of issues for much longer but its a complete waste of time since paradox doesnt listen to their consumers at all proof check early access date release date and how many fixes were added until today

i wouldnt even mind to buy dozens of valuable dlcs but skyline 1 proved to be critical in that matter too at least half of the offered dlcs were not worth community mods did a better job it would be smarter to hire such creators and make a winwin for all

do yourself and all others a favor by boycotting paradox until they learned their lesson and resume their business properly its not like we wouldnt pay a good price for the game but we want a completed game which we can enjoy from start and with reliable support

steam says i officially played 168 hours probably half of it afk timer but regardless i did my part to check the game thoroughly to make this feedback

its very unfortunate that both skyline as well as simcity are now dead to me i never expected paradox to be such a stupid company comparable to ea its a cancer to the game industry

#####

saw the reviews about poor performance scoffed have a top end compy with 3090 and 7800x3d processor ran the game performance was terrible fiddled with the graphics settings got it running at 30fps at 4k 

despite all that the reason i am returning the game is the way shadows and foliage render is terrible it just looks bad worse then the first game imo  this is like a underbaked cake it needs some more time in the oven too bad the simulation aspect looks interesting and complex 

glad steam does refunds

#####

so  i understand that theres a lot of criticism surrounding this game about certain features not implemented major performance and game issues and developers not listening to the community

although i cant review the reason as to why the developers may or may not be listening to the community i can review my own personal experience of csii which was absolutely freaking amazing

first of all i was introduced to cs when it first came out in 2015 i wasnt able to play it because my computer at the time was quite sub par and it couldnt handle a game of this magnitude around three years later i got an apple laptop from a friend of mine although the game performance had improved it wasnt the best when my cities became larger  but this was my first real foray into the cs world another two years later i decided to buy an actual gaming laptop and once again cs performance improved massively  but once again when my cities reached a certain population higher than the mac game performance lagged

why am i telling you this

its because ive experienced the actual frustration of waiting for my games to load for cs to crash on my crappy laptops you wouldnt believe how excited i was when i finally bought my own mid ranged gaming pc an actual pc and csii almost ran like an absolute dream i say almost because not all games are perfect and csii definitely has its share of certain performance issues but one i can handle we all knew what the gaming requirements would be even though the devs didnt initially release that information to begin with 

so to sum up the performance issues performance was not a main game breaking issue for me with my new mid range gaming computer

second of all key features are missing what exactly is a key feature im trying to wrap my head around that is it the seasons and snow feature with its ploughs or the pedestrian boulevard accesses how about the mailing system and the postal vans oh no wait its the industries the ore oil and farming industry that we didnt seem to get in the original cs until its seventh expansion pack yep that must be it 

but apparently the missing feature is bikes i actually had to look up all of the dlcs that came out with the first game to make sure that i wasnt missing any major features and i havent been able to see anything my theory is that the major key feature thats missing is the mods and the issue of it now being behind this new system called paradox mods probably also an issue for everyone when the game came out with no modding capabilities now if thats the case then this is a different thing altogether because i do love certain mods and they really do help improve gameplay tmpe anyone but the idea that you need a mod to actually enjoy the game is beyond ridiculous it will enhance the game play for sure but i think that without mods it makes you think a little bit more for yourself  and i only mean this for the actual game play mods for all the decorative stuff it does make my city look prettier

lastly my personal review look as you may or may not have read above ive really enjoyed this game ive sunk over 200 hours into it because i absolutely love redesigning and starting a city from the ground up the game has an amazing street tool system and the new zoning capabilities are great the absolute look of the game has improved immensely from where it was in cs and i can finally understand and appreciate the name of the game cities skylines because theres nothing more amazing than watching your citizen drive through that complex intersection you concocted and into its little suburban district whilst the major business and tourism districts skyscrapers bloom up in the distance creating an amazing urban skyline

and for me thats what csii is all about the ability to dream up something beautiful and amazing in this next generation of games call me deluded or crazy but no amount of bugs or graphical issues could take me away from this



#####

is it unplayable hell no is it smooth enough to not notice most of the time is it smooth as butter with ultra graphics no but thats not news for those saying that i must have a top of the line rig i have a 1080ti running on medium graphics 

still worth a purchase just fiddle with the graphics for a second like you would anyway unless you do have a streamer pc and youre not used to doing that by default

#####

the game should have been released in early access and all the drama would have been avoided

#####

games poorly optimised pretty sad they fell on the sword here with the old its a city simulation game our target was 3045 fps thats all you need bull  you think we buy 3500 dollar computers to play games on 3045 fps why dont you get with the times and release a game that runs smoothly 

not to mention a lot of the mechanics seem broken traffic doesnt seem to really matter the transport of goods doesnt really matter sometimes you dont even need road access for people to start working at a place this games all over the place 

its crazy theyre now trying to sell us dlc how about you fix all the performance issues then try that at a minimum

big miss here paradox and colossal sad to see you guys are no different than every other aaa studio these days over promise and under deliver

#####

warning do not buy
total scam getting 25fps on 3080 and 14600k
flickering glitchieness popups
looks like mobile game

i went back to cs1 i forgot to leave a review here and here it is

this is a neutral review leaning to recommending as long as you have the patience to tweak the graphics to tune it to your own setup yeah its not great that it runs like a cold lizard on first loading it up but with tweaking and further optimisation itll be fantastic i think people are being possibly slightly overly dramatic and also maybe a bit intimidated by how to optimise the graphics to fit their own hardware was i shocked to see 89fps on first loading it up yes but i then tweaked the settings and got it to run a smooth 2030fps on mostly high settings in 4k

running a 13th gen i913900k overclocked to 58ghz and an rtx 3070 at stock settings

as i said above im getting between 2030fps on 4k on mostly high settings after 15 hours of city building which is a lot better than was reported to do that ive disabled things like motion blur and depth of field textures  shadows are on high as well as aa on high it takes some fiddling but my recommendation is one of try 2 approaches  either set everything to low and turn up anything relating to texture  appearance and see how it runs by then turning on  off anything that impacts on the simulation or effects such as lighting water etc or start on high and turn off animations etc until you hit a sweet spot of appearance vs performance

id also like to strongly encourage colossal order to look at how frontier have incorporated dlss into jurassic world evolution 2 with no dlss the thing can barely scrape 15fps at 4k on my rig but with it i get a flawless 60fps no matter the intensity of the simulation such a complex simulation really benefits from ai tools to get a smooth experience 

this is just my 2 cents but i believe we are now seeing a clear demonstration of exactly why the last simcity was limited to such small maps when it was released a complex simulation requires an insane amount of computing power so you need to use all the tricks at your disposal to make it a smooth and functional experience not just the latter and the only trick they had at the time was to cap the simulation to tick both boxes co have taken a hugely ambitious swing but its a near miss without some serious outofthebox rethinking on how to manage the realtime simulation processing

boş haritada bile 30 fps ile başlıyor insanlara karşı dürüst olmanız  teknik  sorunları çözmüyor ya da oyunu oynanabilir hale getirmiyor optimizasyon sorunlarının yanında oyun visual bug dolu erken erişim olarak çıksaydı bu kadar sorun etmezdim ama tam sürüm olarak çıkartıyoruz deyip bu  kadar rezil bir durumda çıkarmak  büyük rezillik

#####

very poorly optimized for what you pay for ill keep playing cs1 and baldurs gate 3 to distract myself from how much of a disappointment this game was

#####

ive loved cs1 since it released upgraded my gaming pc specifically for it have all the dlc etc i so wanted to like this game i watched every dev diary with eager anticipation it was my one and only exception to the no preorder rule and i played it at launch and saw what a mess it was 

ive waited and been patient but at this point i feel colossal orderparadox have used up all my goodwill and a lot of the community feels the same way there are still fundamental flaws with the game a lack of modding support which made the first game so good and now lacklustre and very late for the deluxe edition owners dlc i cant recommend this game in any way right now  maybe in a couple of years if they actually fix things

#####

the performance issues people are having are from bugged graphics settings which are enabled by default  i can understand the frustration but i think it got review bombed heavier than people give it credit for  followed this tutorial and have been sitting at 5060 fps with a city of 60000 people  

performance tutorial  httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvi6p9wjidutot1sab_channelcitiesbydiana

some of the editing tools for things like terrain and roads are a bit finicky with a learning curve but once you get used to them they are very powerful and well made

overall the game is super addicting if you liked the first one with lots of really well made updates

#####

so this is an odd one

you get a great company with loads of experience making games and then the sequel to one of your favourites comes out and it gets bad reviews so you think how bad can it be surely so i got it anyway

sadly its a bit heartbreaking there are so many really odd decisions from the economy down to the ux that makes me wonder if this is truly the same people it goes all down to the little things like why have a circular influence area and then force the player to trace it with polygons the simple drag and click interfaces that snap into place if you wanted them to  gone even the most straightforward of interactions like building roads and setting routes has become a chore i double checked this with my resident ux artist just to make sure im not just suffering from habit bias its justweird

i appreciate quite a few of the changes such as attaching water and electricity to roads finally city builders finally and the more meaningful zoning options but they dont counteract the clunkyness of the interface and the wobbling economy system and the soulless cheap weird radio announcements like the money was spent in all the wrong places

i really want to recommend it but i cant it doesnt even look meaningfully better than part 1 its like this hasnt been made by the same studio at all this one is a true headscratcher and i would love to hear the studio goss on this one

edit oh and the bugs so so many bugs 

#####

colossal order what have you done to us for years we have supported you and been dedicated to the cs world i preordered this and have tried it for a week now lets be real  it is not ready yet this game could be brilliant and hopefully will be but for now its not

my rig
i9 13900k
asus rtx4090
128gb ddr5 5600 ram
m2 drives

playing at 4k 120hz and ive got everything set to high except depth of field and motion blur both off

according to benchmarks this is a top 1 machine and to be fair it plays smoothly at the moment although ive only got a few thousand inhabitants of my first city so at the moment despite online videos talking about performance my issue isnt fps although im told thatll come unless its patched or optimised

my issues is the rookie mistakes some examples
1 i zoom in and the road houses and people render sharply but next to them a car is still blurred and a billboard is unreadably blurred and they never resolve no matter what i do with the graphics settings

2 every time i pan and zoom everything redraws like its just loaded in why

3 the daynight isnt worth it what is just means is blurry flickering shadows pointless

4 trees keep losing and growing leaves instantaneously they flicker on and off irritating

5 the water animation whilst good doesnt scale when looking at the map from a mile up the water looks like a puddle i have a mod for cs1 that looks better than this

6 the settings dont make sense when changing from high to medium some things look better what is that all about

we all really want this to be brilliant im sticking with it and hoping for updates and improvements but i will stop playing it until then because at the moment its just disappointment after years of hope

#####

devs moving to additional monetization via dlc instead of fixing the base game

#####

so far i have had a great time with the game
had some minor issues but nothing that has ruined the experience

the game offers a lot of features that required mods in the first game and adds a lot of other tools that makes the city building experience a lot better
still got some way to go but this is a great step in the right direction

#####

most of the reviews are talking about performance with monster pc setups  i do not have this just a tad more then the minimum but cant even load a map  i wouldnt suggest even trying this right now unless you have a way more than the minimum  all settings to lowest it will go  1080p resolution

#####

total waste of money the simulation is a lie by way of teleporting citizens and player failure prevention simply a city painter and nothing more

#####

i shouldve listened to the reviews this game is a mess

#####

until mods are added back this game is completely useless you cannot control lights or chose which specific street gets a stop sign without anarchy mod you cant place anything anywhere you want the game constantly fights you on the most stupid placements the move anything mod is also essential as it for some reason you cannot move paths please just look back at your original game take the mods that where extremely popular and figure out how to integrate it into the game without them this game frustrates me beyond belief

#####

this game wasnt released in anything close to a ready state its missing so many features from the first game and they dont even have mod support yet cause they had to make their own damn launcher for the mods and then realized that oopswe dont have a working launcher yet

now after one update in october they are adding payed for dlc before even trying to fixing the game but they are saying that modding will be included in the actual patch that will be coming with itso well see how this goes

but yeah i preordered but didnt do it through steam so im also missing out on the bonuses from it but i am very happy i didnt get the ultimate edition for twice the price sure you get some dlcs and i think a bridgeand then four trees

update 201223
cities skylines 2 has received some updates since my original review it is heading in the direction of a thumbs up with each patch but it is not quite there yet to be more specific if you are a fan of the genre the game is now playable and the systems behind it bmostlyb work performance is now on par with how i remember the original game being which is not great but playable 
however its not quite where it needs to be yet for a more general recommendation hopefully with a few more months of dev time they will get it there


original review
game is pretty good they made a lot of improvements over the original and bi am enjoying my time with itb systems wise its actually very impressive imo there is a lot of simulation going on and its fun learning all these systems the game is balanced very differently to the first game which is nice 

however the performance is clearly not up to par even on minimum settings with everything turned off an rtx3060 is not hitting 30fps even in a small town when i first launched the game before i adjusted the settings even the main menu screen wasnt hitting 20fps 

the game needs more time in the oven to get patched before i can give it a thumbs up  imo a full priced game has to run properly on a modern gaming system before i can recommend it which is a shame because there is a game here that is actually pretty good

#####

i enjoyed it but would not recommend it 
tldr it was badly optimized and had some bugs

bugs for instance were like  regarding placement of specialized industry randomly having problems

i did not interact with any of the citizens and from what ive read theyre a major drain on system resources which i can clearly tell 

the game crashes occasionally as well and its not like i have a bad rig make sure to save or change the settings  as autosave is off by default

i would wait a few months for them to fix the game and only then would i recommend it if they fix the game

#####

deja vu colossal order delivers a colossal disappointment with colossal potential

honestly i expected this to suck on launch day yes there are performance and graphical issues out the wazoo remember though cs 1 was not it when the base game released but over time it became the city builder everyone wanted i think its important to keep in mind that cs ii is going to become something amazing right now they are just letting us play with their platform we all knew the dlc train was going to continue with this one i would say buy at present if you are a die had cs fan and want to play as the game grows at the same time there is 1000 no shame giving this one another several months to a year before diving in im very much looking forward to where cities 2 is headed

#####

i find cs ii not enough polished and stable as of yet while the changes look positive in the overall it needs way more work and while workshop and mods are officially still missing i would like to thank the community for stepping up and providing mods 

i would not recommend yet to buy csii i found that starting with the game is way more complicated than cs i
