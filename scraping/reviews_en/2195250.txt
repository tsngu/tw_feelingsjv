hello ea this is an offline player writing yes we exist sorry that we spent just 80 euro for your game and not 2005000 like other online players or streamers to open your packs you make tha game worse and worse for us i know you dont give a damn so its the last time i will ever buy a product from you guys oh also i play on pc another thing that you people dont care about i get it you are a monopoly 

ps you removed teams endrance in the field to make it faster for online players you could do that only to ut just saying guys just a small example of how you destroy immersion and fun for the offline players
i mean you made playing a 4th division game feeling absolutely the same as playing the champions league final thank you for that

#####

i know ea gets a lot of hate but personally i dont think it gets enough

#####

year after year ea despite being one of the highest grossing video game company of alltime you fail to actually deliver a product on release day that is reflective of its price people are paying a premium for your games every year and are met with some of the most lacklustre mundane and boring features every year sure you can blame us for continuing to buy the game but the truth is i love football you love football and fifaea sports fc is the only game out there that can scratch that itch there are no viable competitors therefore through our love for the beautiful game that is football we keep buying it and you know that ea that is why you refuse to actually do some hard coding in your game and add new featuresimprove the game

you are too busy milking all the 12year old futwhales that spend mum and dads money on your stupid packs which is all that ultimately matters to you in the end you do not care that career mode has not been proper innovated since the dawn of jesus christ or that pro clubs has so much untapped potential all that matters to you is fut and the whales that keep splashing thousands upon thousands every year only for all of their players items to be obsolete the following iteration of fifaeafc 

i would also like to point out that despite us paying the same amount the level of disrespect you have continuously shown us pc players is unforgivable not just this year but every other year do not think we have forgot about the absolute disaster of a release that was fifa 21 fifa 22 and fifa 23 if you are lucky enough to even launch the game you are most likely met with terrible fps choppy animations bugged out player models and honestly the list is endless if i wanted it to be speaking of lists i am going to provide one with all of the bugs that i encountered in my first few hours of gameplay

  choppy animations frames drop and becomes an eyesore to watch
  commentary does not work on launch there is 0 commentary
  player models the hair bugs out when it is rainy and foggy becomes pixelated
  can not connect to the internet whatever this means 
  controllers not working properly
  game keeps minimising on pc 
  the game is not opening and launching for so many players
  can not sack coaches in career mode it just freezes 
  objectives not counting
  not getting xp when completing objectives 
  the game freezes on the ea fc logo 
  stuck in halftime animation
  gameplay stutter 
  overall terrible performance even on highend hardware 
  anticheat error message 
  media questions still make 0 sense
  same animations for media interviews and transfers
  same animations for injuries etc 0 innovation and creativity here
  menu in fut will freeze and you have to close the game and launch it again
  if you navigate the menu too quickly it messes up and goes all over your screen

again like mentioned this list could be as long as you want it to be the point is you are incompetent ea and you are especially incompetent when it comes to creating a proper pc port but of course because you know we love football and we simply have no other alternatives you can keep getting away with this i am an idiot for playing this game and enabling it and i know i am but that is not going to stop me from speaking out about the disgrace of a company you run 

also why on earth would you remove players walking out onto the pitch and lining up before a game what went on in your heads over there at ea when you thought hmm let us replace this key part of immersion building and realism and replace it with a few stupid cutscenes then immediately throw you into the game where everyone is already on the pitch ready to go what about champions league nights important finals etc there is no immersion anymore you do not get to watch your team walk out line up with the anthem roaring in the background your players lined up and ready to battle it out it just sends you straight into action this is so stupid as a career mode enjoyer shock i know right cause who still willingly plays this neglected mode this totally kills off getting any sort of feeling towards your games especially big ones mindboggling decision begs the question in typical ea fashion which iteration of ea fc will you bring this back and market it as a brand new immersive feature

 fifa 23 renamed to eafc 24
new update
after more than 200 hours timeplay here is my review for the gameplay
tbh purble place is a better game than fc24 this game is awful
do you want to win 71 depth  5 at back  cutbacks  direct passing  and there you go you have anything that you need to win now its up to you
how this game works its more like rocket league the ball just gonna bounce 1284 times until you concede a goal like bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce finesse shot and yep thats a goal there is no point in defending the ball just gonna bounce back to your opponent
your cdms are man marked by strikers yes your cdms are man marked by strikers and the rest of your players too 
90 minutes pressure without lossing stamina and the only option that you have is to make a long pass from your lb to your rb or from your rb to your lb and then you have to wait for your opponent to make a mistake so you can make a move and create yourself a chance to score
for those whos gonna defend this company and say skill issue let me tell you something
there is no skill issue cause this game doesnt require skill anymore
its all about being a rat and have some luck 
do yourself a favor and stay away of this awful thing  im not gonna call this thing a game anymore cause its not this thing is not fun or entertaining like it supposed to be

its crazy how despite the fact they copy paste this crap every year they still somehow make it worse its actually impressive how useless they are

okey after a long time i will finaly post a review of eafc24 and the fifafranchise as a whole yes i know that it isnt called fifa anymore

this gamefranchise from ea is sadly the only real way to scratch your itch if you are actually looking to play the game not only manage it like fm the way ea has done it has been insanely painfull to watch i have played almost every game of fifa now eafc since 2010 on console and now on pc and console it has gotten worse every time the features they add that are new and cool they remove as fast as the next version is out but i get ahead of myself let me review this game

they put all of their marbles into fut and volta this is where they milk their whales and scratch the itch of football gamblers around 3040 of their playerbase is supposed to be people that play careermode a gamemode they have taken a massive dump on since 2016

1 the play it self is full of bugs people glitching out hitboxes not being in place etc i dont know how many times i have rewinded to see that a ball went through a leg or a bodypart because of the hitbox glitching 

2 the ai has become seemingly worse for every game the ai reacts to everything as the input is put in on your end but it seems like your players arent doing it at the exact second it has a small delay making the opponent seem like they are reading your mind 

3 the amount of scanned faces is just downright bad a couple of days ago started a new career wanted to play a real manager it is like less than 30 faces of real managers actually scanned into the game because instead of putting people they have previously scanned into a folder at the end they are just removed i dont care if the small picture of my manager is his real face when you never see that picture but you always see the worst version of a fake model for a manager ever created 

4 customization on the different platforms you make a character on volta or clubs the online gamemode vs other playercreated teams you get access to a huge number of hairstyles features tattoos etc those are not accessable on career at all the jerseys you have on createaclub is horrible they say they added sponsors and it is just the dice logo and an ea logo this was something they had on fifa06 where you chose fake companies that added both a kitsponsors and some challenges to the gameplay to get more money into your save that feature has still only been in that game 

5 kitsponsors for some reason i dont know if it is licensing or whatever but if you go online on some teams their sponsors disappear i now have a save with watford if i am online they have no main kitsponsor if i go offline they have 

6 goalkeepers okey i only have 2 issues with goalkeepers and i will keep it short they cant save on their nearpost 90 of the time they just cant if it is the animations or how they are coded in positioning i have no clue doesnt matter if he is 50 rated or 91 rated cant save it problem number 2 with keepers is the way they move this might be a bug but sometimes when you force them out of goal they seem to pull straight out not regarding their position at all so run straight out and the goal being fully open because of their movement 

7 the gameplay okey i will not shit on the gameplay too much just a tiny bit for some reason i still dont know why this is how ea has treated the gameplay 20182020  pace was king 20212022  lay the ball into the box and you will have most chances of scoring goals in the last games they have added this feature and i still dont know why powershot powershot is seemingly vs the ai the stupidest gameplay mechanic out there they ai are in your face long before the animation is close to trigger and if they are for some reason not there are 8 people in your way blocking it seemingly disregarding every single teammate you have around them just to block your shot if you turn handball on in rules you will have a literal ton of freekicks and penalties but if you keep it off they seemingly play handball due to animations and positioning 

its probably a lot of stuff i have forgotten to mention but this is what is in my head atm

conclusion since there are no other good footballgame to play sadly this is your only option if you have played this series of games before you know how bad it has gotten even with its newer shinier finish i cant recommend it at full price at all it is not worth it and if you love football all the small things will annoy you ea is getting worse and worse for every game they put out so do not think the next one will be any better

why can i be upset about this game i have around 10k hours in fifagames in total most on console i have followed fifa since the original xbox and the ps1 all the way up to ps5 gamingpc and xbox one x i have both played fut clubs volta beapro and careermode fifa and now eafc are games i come back to because i love football and because i see it as a chill pasttime

hopefully this is helpful for the ones thinking about buying it ea will never see this review or think about it and will probably never change their ways

updated review

please note that this is purely my experience of the game during the stupid hours i have sunk into it

i wont be completely critical of the game and ill give credit to a couple of things most notably the gameplay i like the animations and the motion of the players they are fun to control i play on normal gameplay speed and it feels great players are responsive and it is very fun trying to keep shape defensively especially against ultimate difficulty but with practice you get there attacking is satisfying too i like the different dribbling styles although r1 dribbling at the time of this review is a little overpowered but even still i am happy that its possible to dribble past players in this years game and score some lovely solo goals 

i play purely offline as where i am currently located i just cannot get a good enough connection to have any kind of online experience

however  despite ea releasing updates not one of them has combated the biggest issue myself and many many others face which is the abhorrent optimisation which is leading to stutters and for some lag and game crashes 

i would not want to know how many of those hours i have spent trialling fixes and it is the first time in my gaming experience to encounter a game that just wont play sometimes a workaround will fix things temporarily but upon the next launch it just doesnt work again this to me is unacceptable they are aware of the problem yet nothing has changed now for well over a month of it being released the hell ive been through to sort it should never be required to play any game i paid 80 but i feel like ea owe me a years salary for the amount of work ive done on their game for them crooks

stutters in these kinds of games destroy any pleasurable experience you can get from it imagine playing an f1 game but before every corner it stutters for 3 seconds and when it fixes itself youve crashed into an entire neighbouring village and caused 500 million worth of damage youd say forget it and toss it in the bin the same goes for football games you need precision and reactions because timing is important you cant do that with 3second stutters intermittently during a match how can nobody have seen this i feel like mugatu from zoolander

it was a new era for the franchise a fresh start so i allowed myself to believe that things may be different but it just isnt the case for any of the offline modes if you think adding cut scenes of players winning the balon dor where nobody even speaks other than some announcer which freaks me out and an opentop bus parade of trophies youve won which is cool the first time but it is the same every single time after then you dont understand why we play football games  we want to play not sit there and watch silent movies is this their attempt at making it more immersive disaster

true some promising ideas were introduced like tactical vision and hiring coaches in manager mode but heres the thing  that was bugged when it was released imagine working on a new feature but for it not to work properly what i mean is that you cant fire coaches youll lock the game and have no chance to back out i actually hope it doesnt get patched because it doesnt matter it tells us what we already know  they dont care 

its a shame because i think that if theyd just put more effort into it this couldve been a really good game the foundation is there with the gameplay and thats the heart of any good football game but why not just stop being a bunch of fraggles and develop your offline game modes more the amount of work they put into create a team for example which was just uninspiring is what i am talking about put that work into actually making a comprehensive immersive career mode create a team was fantastic in the f1 game it works in that circumstance but for a manager mode on a football game it isnt what we want 

for those who cant be bothered to read all that youll feel just like mugatu from zoolander  it really is the same face

#####

did i ever tell you what the definition of insanity is insanity is doing the exact same fcking thing over and over again expecting sht to change that is crazy

#####

rubbish poor optimisation for pc developers dont care about pc players dont waste your money

#####

this is by far the worst ea game actually scratch that just game in general for starters my character is an absolute cinder block who cannot hold onto the ball for longer than 2 nanoseconds and there is no reason my 93 pace striker is getting beaten by some 7 foot 400 pound defender in speed if they literally carbon copied any fifa game it would have been 100 times better than this piece of shit and that is so sad ea is by far one of the worst companies right now the cpus all are fresh out of the lobotomy table the menu looks like a mcdonalds menu and the movement feels like my character feels like a neanderthal who never played soccer before was put into the premiere league if you are considering buying this game please give your money to anything else or maybe give money to the anti lobotomy association in hopes of the ea developers getting the help they deserve this is by far the worst game i have played in my life and it is really sad steam allows this pathetic idea that shouldve been swallowed made it to the platform i hope ea goes under and the ceos starve this game is just horrible and should not have ever seen the light ea losing the rights to fifa was a sign from god to end this horrible excuse for a franchise yet they could not see the massive letters in the sky saying please do not play this game should have been looked at for 3 seconds and then executed along with the developers please do not let this pathetic game and company trick you into stealing your money for some dog shit worse than roblox soccer game genuinely roblox feels so much better than this in some of their soccer games and it is so sad that as a society we allowed this to get more than 1 person playing please do not buy this game i am on my knees begging please save yourself i guarantee you will get stage 4 brain cancer and will most likely hurt yourself playing this other than that the game is great this game is so shit that i would still be upset if they payed me to play it do not buy and thanks for reading this game sucks dick

#####

good game like always especially the gambling mechanics designed for kids are something that is really innovative

#####

im playing tot vs mun and i hear the crowd chanting chelsea we love you really shows you the state of fifa
no commentary weird brightness glitches terrible online servers they made the players move 1 more realistically and called it a day so glad this is an ea play trial do not waste ur money on this go torrent fifa 14

#####

purchased ultimate edition 
recieved none of the things from the ultimate edition 
ea launcher says i purchased the standard edition 
i despise this company

#####

ive played this game a bunch of hours  sure but its absolutely horrendous they regress every single year as do my brain cells unfortunately for continuing to buy this garbage

its glitchy football that crashes and is devoid of any worthwhile tutorials

the game is tailored for pack openings in fut of which i have no interest in

the only  and i mean the only  reason i get this game is to stimulate myself while i do more worthwhile things with my life like listening to music podcasts or audiobooks

an absolute waste of time on its own by a monopolistic greedy company that owns the rights to the biggest global sport

worst game to play you cannot make the plays you want to make ai is completely scripted when the dda is in your favour you cannot make a mistake even if you try when dda is against you your player become weaker tan bronze players whether you win or lose dda is always present in a way that forces you to play the way game is scripted to be played after every few games the menus glitch out all the images on packs and sbc break you cannot apply consumables to players or do any action without having to restart the game if this wasnt triggering enough we have the most toxic community of players playing this game they will spam running down the line with cutbacks and when the dda is against you your players will be slower and you tackles will be weaker at first i thought it was a skill issue but dda cannot be more obvious at the end if you play long enough you will close this game frustrated ea fc 24 is the furthest thing from good football game

#####

this game is seriously a joke especially on pc on top of that there is clear scripting that goes on in every game mode for example you go up by two goals then all of a sudden your players start moving like they are stuck in quick sand your opponent whether it be ai or a real person will clearly be moving faster than you and they go right down the field and score as you try to click to the closest defender but suddenly the buttons youve been accurately flipping through your players with just dont work the same you are left unable to switch onto your defender to try to prevent the goal and left to watch in horror as the ai refuses to acknowledge the threat in the box and you 100 get scored on it is sincerely to the point where you can predict it will happen and then it does it specifically happens in intense moments or games ex online promotion match or a cup final in career mode i still play this game as there are many aspects i enjoy but unless you can get over the fact that you will be trying to beat another player online while actively watching the game reduce your players abilities in an attempt to sway the game then you will be miserable you will watch it happen to people you play against and it will get to the point where you feel like your wins werent earned and your losses werent deserved i very much wish i wouldnt have purchased this game

edit i forgot to mention this is such public knowledge throughout the player base to the point that people use lower overall players and teams in matches in an attempt to receive less hindrance if you are playing with a worse team then your players move smooth as butter and outrun the better players for the other team its absolutely wild and infuriating sincerely one of the scummiest things ive seen a company do in a game

#####

i dont think this game was fully ready to release yet no broadcast package before the match for those who always plays offline theres a bug where oppenent could be invisible and then tackle you why so many players do gesture like haaland in the news of career mode and so many real faces player didnt get update like griezmann so just enjoy ur fifa 23 and using a mod thatll better than u buy this game rn

#####

they removed walkouts anthems and formation intros in career mode for fc 24 on steam yet somehow the same game on the last gen consoles still has it  gigachad 9000iq move figured since ea lost the fifa license they would finally have to start putting in some more effort into the game idk where my head was probably so far up my ass smelling my own copium because it seems they are taking stuff out instead only recently for the last couple of years did i come back buying fifa games probably going to stay away for another 10 years

#####

affects mental health

#####

if you value your mental stability please stray far away from not only this game but ea sports vancoover as whole these stingy frickers dont give two whoopties about their game and only want you for your wallet

#####

i mean i m not kidding this is the worst i repeat the worst fifa i have ever ever played 

it is starting to become a meme online everywhere it is so bad so mediocre every 15 seconds of gameplay some weird stuff happen defenders lose the ball after tackling every time players dont react to the ball being 1 inch away from them goal keepers somethings are gods while other times act like theyre ghosts there has been games i made 25 shoots while my opponent did 34 and they win 14 23 while fifa even jokes oh my face saying expected goals 61 or something similar

i have been playing fifa for 20 years and i dont remember ever playing such a bad football game i mean i dont think i have ever seen so much crap mess in a football game i mean it is that bad this game so so bad you build up your team and they act like you mean it you start winning they start losing their positioning on the field they start to fall apart like it wants you to lose the game and the bugs oh lord everywhere i have had games when the opposing goal keeper would rush my striker and there is no penalties i have seen defender almost breaking legs and fault is on the opposite side i have seen faults for red cards and refs dont even show a card there is times when multiple shoots go directly to your goal keepers face and they cant save it the amount of bull s is insane this game is trash garbage the worst fifa ever how is possible that a company that copy pastes their framework every year destroy their own product jokes is on you ea

i never felt i was being robbed insulted by a game this game is an insult to everyone who is actually good at playing football games even the worst player on fifa can beat you this game is nasty broken horrible worst game i have ever played

looks like this game is never consistent the amount of inconsistency is incredible there is times i just watch replays too see i m not going crazy i had times when my opponent shot in the replay the ball went through both legs no colisions same happens with goal keepers there are so many and i mean so many hundreds of times striker is less than a meter away from the goal keeper theres no way he can score it will either hit the keeper or go above and goal keepers let the ball go in its insane huge pass stick with singleplayer modes you will have a hard time playing online in this game and even in career mode i have seen similar issues

#####

ea is only good at one thing and its at dissapointing us

#####

i only play career mode

#####


 
are you wasting my money again son
 
  
 
  
 
 
 

  






#####

think twice before buying i bought this game with 75 discount and still feels like it was such a waste of money this game is a disgrace horrible horrible performance like lets use bubble sort in render loop just for fun slow horrendous frame drops and lag spikes on an rtx3080 and intel i911900 i cant even start to imagine how a mid tier computer can run this game when i slash out all the quality settings to low then the gameplay dread starts i suspect they asked chatgpt to write the physics engine its clearly faulty even the motion speed of 2 teams dont match on the field my world class team and 8890 rating players run like theyve had 2 large pizzas each 10 minutes before the match i had to pause the game with the fear that someone might have a heart attack on the field its like a slow motion team is playing against a realtime team

its unplayable doesnt deserve a single penny you are warned stick with fifa22

#####

theres more bugs in this game than in grounded

#####

ive been playing every fifa game from f09 to f23 without complaining
fc24 on the otherhand does not come close to the experience of all the other installments and that is concerning
fc24 runs poorly lag in offline mode gamesmatches audio bugs and other bugs i shall not name here as many others have already done so

this is seriously the very first time im refunding a game after only playing 25 minutes 
if that doesnt say something i dont know what will

for those who look for a smooth and polished game go back to fifa23 
fc24 is not worth your money nor your time

#####

i will always recommend this garbage to my enemies

#####

h3backgroundh3

i bhave prior experienceb playing and enjoying football simulators and this isnt my first encounter with the genre or the specific franchise as a football enthusiast my expectations were quite low especially after reading some reviews nevertheless i approached the game with interest and hope for a positive surprise however i bcannot recommend this gameb unless you fall into a very specific group of people which i will elaborate on in this review

lets delve into the three most prominent game modes which essentially encompass about 99 of the games content

h3ultimate teamh3

if youve ever witnessed people playing slots in las vegas this mode might evoke similar feelings of shame and disgust its advisable to reconsider and bseek helpb if you find yourself going down this path

h3career modeh3

this mode should constitute the majority of your gameplay if you lean towards a power trip style of play progress change leagues build a team win titles and more you even have the flexibility to adjust sliders and difficulty for a challenging experience against the computer

h3clubsh3

on paper this mode appears highly promising you can choose a role team up with friends play together lead your team to higher leagues claim trophies enhance your character customize appearance and skills to match your gameplay and compete against other teams sounds super fun right well heres the catch

h3the catch  main thesish3

the game is bevidently flawedb while it claims to be a football simulator its more of an bexploit simulatorb if you dont conform to the prevailing trends in team composition and player abilities centered around what is exploitable youll find yourself unable to compete against those who do you will lose learning and executing exploits becomes a necessity and while there are numerous tutorial videos available succumbing to this approach can ruin the overall gaming experience

allow me to provide some examples that resonate with around 90 of the player base the games current form and as per discussions with other players past and possibly future iterations is highly exploitable consequently youll witness only three types of goals in this socalled football simulator

1  players exploiting the sides of the pitch executing either a cross beckhams to ronaldo vs zaragoza or a series of cheap passes systematically positioned between your defenders

2  a finessetrivela kick from the corner of the box quaresma style always resulting in a goal due to a bug in goalkeeper positioning

3  a messy firstpost header from a corner forcing you to move the goalkeeper around the box while the opponent reverts to the aforementioned alternatives

while you may score and witness hundreds of goals like these the games rigidity to these play styles and gamebreaking mechanics eradicates the sense of being immersed in a football simulator it feels more like a game of bexploit or perishb

h3to wrap it uph3

frankly i anticipated much more from the purported bestinindustry and expensive game this disappointment isnt solely based on the gameplay it extends to actual bugs involving matchmaking glitched menus automatic configuration reverting uniform malfunctions a community rife with sore losers resorting to excessive sliding tackles and leaving matches when behind glitched animations inexplicable computer decisions alleged handicapping of matches and other issues that my friends and i endured to play this game

in summary and being entirely candid i bstrongly advise againstb subjecting yourself to this experience

h3that being saidh3

 theres one exception though if you happen to be a diehard fan of the franchise for decades maintaining a closeknit group of friends who play it year after year regardless of the games price or condition if thats the case go ahead perhaps the camaraderie with your friends will provide moments of laughter temporarily diverting your attention from the overall mess that this game truly is

#####

i cant believe i wasted my hardearned money on ea fc 24 and im utterly disgusted with this socalled game its nothing more than a blatant cash grab designed to milk players for every penny they have ea should be ashamed of themselves for promoting such a toxic and predatory gaming experience

first and foremost the paytowin mechanics in this game are absolutely absurd youre practically forced to open your wallet just to have a fighting chance want to unlock your favorite players get ready to fork over a small fortune because grinding for them is a futile endeavor the games loot boxes are nothing short of a digital casino preying on vulnerable players who are desperate to assemble a decent team its a disgrace

#####

same game as always but worse optimization and some clubs and national teams aint there also the full price aint worth   refund real quick

#####

money lauderi9ng

#####

my experience with fc 24 on my midhigh end pc was far from satisfactory the games performance was consistently disappointing struggling to maintain a decent frame rate and delivering choppy lagfilled graphics on top of that frequent disconnections from the server disrupted my gameplay leaving me frustrated and disconnected from the intended experience

the gameplay itself left much to be desired with clunky and unresponsive mechanics that hindered the enjoyment of action sequences controls lacked the expected precision leading to mistimed actions and missed opportunities to make matters worse fc 24 suffered from poor optimization evident in excruciatingly long loading times and sluggish menu navigation

in summary from performance issues and server disconnects to lackluster gameplay and subpar optimization it was a letdown potential buyers should exercise caution before investing time and money into what should have been an engaging gaming experience

#####

did i ever tell you the definition of insanity

#####

this is by far the worst fifa ever
i have bought and owned all fifa releases since 2002 on the day it was released i have paid a premium to ea every year for the fifa franchise for 21 years straight
the game is absolutely disgusting and ridiculous yes they have made a few improvements like they do every year but along with those improvements which are minimal like always the things that are wrong with the game made me feel like i just wasted my money and time i know there is a crazy amount of fifa fans out there please do not waste your money i understand all the latest squads and transfers and other stuff we look forward to which is always discontinued in the last fifa when the actual transfer window begins wait for ea to release an update addressing the issues that are there in the game if they address the issues at all

issues that have nothing to do with the gameplay
the display refresh rate settings are locked to 60fps on laptop desktop is adjustable
the game stutters and lags and is absolutely impossible at times this happens even on menu screens in career mode or any other when you are not even playing a match
drastic and random fps drops every 510 seconds
i have a rtx 3060 laptop with 64gb ram and a rtx 4090 highend desktop same lag and stuttering on both machines so definitely the problem is with the game software itself
this is what i get after paying a premium to one of the biggest franchises in the gaming industry the game overall feels like it was incomplete in its development but the launch date had to be met what a shame  

gameplay issues

 the goalkeeper in the game is irrelevant 
 shooting and finishing is the worst ever
 even though the ball control is better and there is an element of centre of gravity in the movement of the player in control which is nice i still feel there is so much wrong in the overall movement of the player in control 
 passing is the worst ever 
 first touch is inconsistent
there is so much more wrong with the gameplay and i am hoping that these issues will be addressed with an update i would be shocked if this is how the game is meant to be 

to all the fifa fans out there wait for an update and fixes by ea the game is not enjoyable and at times unplayable due to stutters and lags absolutely not worth a single penny of yours the way it is

#####

kinda like garfield kart except it cost a weeks worth of groceries cant run consistently at even 60 fps on a 3070ti and doesnt have any options to let you play as nermal

#####

dont buy packs im being sued by my parents now

#####

its like fifa 98 but in 2024

#####

ea

#####

hallelujah scammed again cant wait for next year so i can do it all over again

#####

tackling women very fun

#####

the worst game ever in regards to optimization
not only am i covering the pc requirements but i shall be able to play at ultra without any lag
but still even when playing with the lowest graph the game still lags and ruins that ruins everything
the most ridiculous thing is that just after the release it was running smoother than now after updates patches and so on
yes there was still lag from time to time but when playing with max graph not with min as now
im starting to think that ea posted false system requirements to scam people to buy their game or the only thing they do to the game is make it worse with every next patch and update
there are good things though  the players motion is great and more realistic than ever mechanicswise the game is the greatest fifa so far totally love the way the players interact and act as a whole
but its freakn unplayable with all the lag
i even thought about upgrading my pc but then i realized that the problem isnt on my side so even if i upgrade this otherwise amazing game will remain unplayable because of the lag
i feel cheated

#####

has a lot of bugs that dont exist on other platforms

#####

i will do 1 push up for every like this review gets


#####

its fifa basic technical issues that have been present for the last few years still not fixed
the new crossplay for pro clubs is also broken good job ea

#####

year after year ea despite being one of the highest grossing video game company of alltime you fail to actually deliver a product on release day that is reflective of its price people are paying a premium for your games every year and are met with some of the most lacklustre mundane and boring features every year sure you can blame us for continuing to buy the game but the truth is i love football you love football and fifaea sports fc is the only game out there that can scratch that itch there are no viable competitors therefore through our love for the beautiful game that is football we keep buying it and you know that ea that is why you refuse to actually do some hard coding in your game and add new featuresimprove the game

you are too busy milking all the 12year old futwhales that spend mum and dads money on your stupid packs which is all that ultimately matters to you in the end you do not care that career mode has not been proper innovated since the dawn of jesus christ or that pro clubs has so much untapped potential all that matters to you is fut and the whales that keep splashing thousands upon thousands every year only for all of their players items to be obsolete the following iteration of fifaeafc

i would also like to point out that despite us paying the same amount the level of disrespect you have continuously shown us pc players is unforgivable not just this year but every other year do not think we have forgot about the absolute disaster of a release that was fifa 21 fifa 22 and fifa 23 if you are lucky enough to even launch the game you are most likely met with terrible fps choppy animations bugged out player models and honestly the list is endless if i wanted it to be speaking of lists i am going to provide one with all of the bugs that i encountered in my first few hours of gameplay

 choppy animations frames drop and becomes an eyesore to watch
 commentary does not work on launch there is 0 commentary
 player models the hair bugs out when it is rainy and foggy becomes pixelated
 can not connect to the internet whatever this means
 controllers not working properly
 game keeps minimising on pc
 the game is not opening and launching for so many players
 can not sack coaches in career mode it just freezes
 objectives not counting
 not getting xp when completing objectives
 the game freezes on the ea fc logo
 stuck in halftime animation
 gameplay stutter
 overall terrible performance even on highend hardware
 anticheat error message
 media questions still make 0 sense
 same animations for media interviews and transfers
 same animations for injuries etc 0 innovation and creativity here
 menu in fut will freeze and you have to close the game and launch it again
 if you navigate the menu too quickly it messes up and goes all over your screen

again like mentioned this list could be as long as you want it to be the point is you are incompetent ea and you are especially incompetent when it comes to creating a proper pc port but of course because you know we love football and we simply have no other alternatives you can keep getting away with this i am an idiot for playing this game and enabling it and i know i am but that is not going to stop me from speaking out about the disgrace of a company you run

also why on earth would you remove players walking out onto the pitch and lining up before a game what went on in your heads over there at ea when you thought hmm let us replace this key part of immersion building and realism and replace it with a few stupid cutscenes then immediately throw you into the game where everyone is already on the pitch ready to go what about champions league nights important finals etc there is no immersion anymore you do not get to watch your team walk out line up with the anthem roaring in the background your players lined up and ready to battle it out it just sends you straight into action this is so stupid as a career mode enjoyer shocking i know right cause who still willingly plays this neglected mode this totally kills off getting any sort of feeling towards your games especially big ones mindboggling decision begs the question in typical ea fashion which iteration of ea fc will you bring back and market as a brand new immersive feature

#####

its the same as previous fifa games yes
it makes me angry yes
do i enjoy playing it no
why the fck im still playing it i love opening packs
is it worth it hell no

eafc 24 review
 graphics improvement
 new gameplay
 great ui but sometimes got ui glitch in fut cant move  click
 dynamic commentator you can turn off this
 dynamic pre half and post match cutscene
 camera view

 cursor keep centered in screen after my wireless mouse idle cant move menu moments settings etc because of that
 i dont like eafc 24 song playlist fifa23 better
 poor graphics optimization not ready to release the game
 should be cheaper because no longer use fifa title name

ultimate team review
 faster than fifa23 to choose player in squad
 claim all reward for one objective not all objective
 no longer wasting time playing squad battle its quicker than fifa23
 removed loan player in sbc

 menu with scroll down in the top left corner is bad and hard to see container too small and need larger  bolder font
 hidden red dot button inside objective page hard to see and find completed objective
 sometimes objective not counted
 no shortcut to go to squad down left analog like fifa23
 opponent quit after score the equal goal not counted as win 
 swap side glitch ex lead 50 then your opponent pause the game and swap the side you are now losing 05 after the endgame you got forever loop post match cutscene force close this no worry you still won the game
 sometimes force me to disconnect to the main menu and counted as lose hack or game bug
 women in ultimate team is bad idea
 no kits color in scoreboard
 so many sbc requirement error in game  companion ex sbc need barca man or women but marked as invalid if you put barca men in companion or barca women ingame
 cant skip stadiumtifoetc pack
 removed rank progress bar in squad battle
 ai hack is back fuuuuvk you ea

companion apps review
 unable to filter chemistry styles by type in transfer
 unable to manager leagues consumable by league styles in transfer
 unable to change club name
 unable to change player shirt number
 unable to pick some player in evolution need to do it in game ex ferran torres in founders evolution this item does not meet the eligibility requirements

buy eafc 24 if you want to play offline

ea sports fc 24 highlights  can they show the world they dont need the fifa licence to succeed 202324  0 zero skill gap   manual defending no hermano artificial intelligence will do it all   high depth auto press suffocating you in your own box   playing through the middle  byline cutbacks   4000 new hypermotion animations  awful implementation slows gameplay down even more  gameplay patches to improve user experience  5 new elite deluxe supreme store packs every week   give me freedom  give me fire  give me overpowered playstyles pay2win  or i retire 

#####

there are no words to explain this horror of a game

ea sells the same game every year with different rosters they dont care about the players at allthe only thing they care about is packs and your money

a little fat pimply kid steals his moms credit card who works three jobs to feed him and kills you in fut with the greatest legends of this sport and theres nothing you can do about it to earn those players you need at least 1k15k hoursa classic pay to win game where little brats heal their insecurities and school bullying by buying players and laughing when they beat you by a large margin

secondly referees sometimes behave in this shitty game as if they dont know the rules there will be a lot of penalties that wouldnt even be given to barcelona

thirdly the game is full of bugs good luck with that

i bought this paid honestly and a lot just to inflict emotional pain on myself

010 fuck you ea

#####

i play solely on manager career mode so i upgraded to fc 24 mainly because i wanted to do one run as inter miami i could have theoretically made it work by doing transfers on fifa 23 until the roster was mainly the same but i decided to just go ahead and update the game so that the work would be done for me and so that i would get to try the new game 

game is about the same overall but i think it got some nice updates 
 training is no longer required or heavily featured in career mode i actually thought it was gone until i saw it as optional before game time this was a big one for me because otherwise you were grinding for the all as with terrible players at the beginning of the season instead of playing actual matches 
 the cut the scene were they walk out  i know some people gripe about it but i like how the intro is now shorter i was skipping the walk out almost every single time so it overall felt like it was flowing a bit better
 the new traits are actually helpful  the trait that lets you dribble is nice and the trait to get longer lines in free kicks is awesome the latter is one that i will actively scout for because it so useful and make those free kicks less of a guessing game 
 looks are actually improved this time  when i upgraded for 22 to 23 the looks were objectively worse for me in 24 the graphics are a bit nicer without requiring me to upgrade my video card 

overall if you have fifa 23 and you can afford it go for the upgrade if the price tag is too steep you are better off staying on fifa 23 until they have a massive discount on a few months if you hated 23 then you will hate fc 24 as it is essentially the same game with a few more bells and whistles

mom said to never pick up trash but i didnt listen to her in 2022 i didnt listen to her in 2023 too but this time i am throwing this trash away 

jokes apart the company couldnt make it worse horrible gameplay riddled with bs scripting pay to win to the core super annoying and bs ai for those who like to play singleplayer only if changing name could turn crap to gold

i cant access store in ultimate team as my resolution is 1366768 what a joke shame on such pathetic developers

i rather play efootball

ai is really good offensively and really bad defensively i mostly play career mode with tactical view only so please fix the ai because i dont want each team to score 10 goals in every single game 

i am disabled and the addition of being able to play as a manager without having to control the players myself is very important to me people who complain about this new addition are not disabled and they will never know how difficult it is to participate in a video game let alone play it

so good job ea for adding the tactical view into the game i hope you improve the ai as well so we can take full advantage of this mode

i bought this game last week and im almost 20 hours in im in a bit of a unique situation as a very casual fifa player for context i only recently started getting back into the sport as a spectator after a spell of not caring at all about sports and as such i decided to buy eafc 24 so i can play the game in the modern day for context the last and only fifa game i ever had was fifa 15 so almost 10 years between the editions i bought

im also not your usual fifa player in that i could not care less about ut sure ill open it every once in a while do some objectives open the reward packs and call it a day but im not interested in the competitive play because im too ass at the game if i were to load up a friendly right now id get stomped by someone whos played every fifa since they were born and already has a team of icons and heroes and trailblazers so i only play manager and player modes mostly player mode actually right now im about 4 months into my first year at reading with the intention of making the jump to the pl and becoming the worlds best cfcam in existence 

of course this game is buggy even as a casual player i see the bugs that this game has its just classic fifa ive already seen player models inside each other incompetent goalkeeping strange crowd chants for teams that arent playing crashes player images not loading in ut cards etc i came into this game expecting this the bar was low but its been enjoyable ive been having fun player career mode has been particularly fun ive been on legendary difficulty and am still able to perform well as an individual its not egregiously difficult where i cant score goals or dribble past defenders or make passes but its also not insanely easy where i score 4 goals every match and just farm the league the one thing i really dont like is how the manager favor immediately decides your eligibility for starting 11 i dropped a stinker one game and my managers favor dropped so much that i was a sub for the next three games despite me being a scoring machine which doesnt make sense if haaland drops a stinker every once in a while and pep decides to bench him for a month thatd be horrible but i digress and no i dont restart games im not a cheater if my team loses then my team loses if i drop a stinker then i drop a stinker

also i hate to be that guy but anyone thats been complaining about the game not running correctly has either never opened the options menu or has a really shit computer i have a gaming laptop so its not a potato but its also not a full battlestation the game runs fine at medium settings hovering around 120 fps the few times ive played online on fut have been great and lagless which was something i remember very much struggling with on fifa 15 when i had it

if youre like me and only buy a fifa once every few years i would recommend this game it has its charm and offers enough to keep you entertained especially if you dont do ut either just make sure to lower your expectations its still ea and its still fifa its not at all perfect but its fun and thats what matters to me

#####

game is meh look at this instead

h1b80 off kinda justifies the amount of content we are getting but in terms of overall quality in the gamenobh1

which is really poor even after so many patches they just dont know how to fix their mess when it comes to pc version of their game bibig l eaib  smh

#####

dont be like me and throw your cash in this dumpster fire and expect something groundbreaking

my first fifa was 97 been with the series for a while now thought id buy 24 this year because this time it would be different new name and sorts well you guessed it nope same like it used to be only worse gameplay feels slow glitching players defending is hot trash you can only compete in fut if you buy a whole team full of high pace players which are the most expensive ones most of the time so your forced to put some extra money in if you really want to compete in rivals and champions plus if your not playing the meta formation and tactics your getting smacked 

a fun part for me with these kind of games is to build a nice well rounded team open some packs and hope the rng gods bless me with a good player ea managed to mess up that part as well because of the women they added there is nothing more hearth breaking to see st psg and to see a women youve never heard of appear instead of mbappe we have all seen the youtube videos i guess
 
maybe its just me and im getting tired of the same formula

game is laggy af dont buy

probably the worst fifa released in history at launch cant go back to home screen after matches trying to fire coaches locks you in a menu invisible players tackling leaves you at a 5050 of who gets the ball fast 79 ovr players cost 60k on the market and are stronger than 88 ovr cbs fix your game ea although we know you never will

#####

i can end womens career
710

#####

before i played ea sports fc 24 i had a small wee wee no friends no boyfriend depression and absolutely no will to live none of these things have changed but the game is pretty bad

#####

ea fc 24 is so bad it makes fifa 23 look like a masterpiece



#####

just bought the game and tried it for the first eight hours
coming from a guy who hasnt bought a fifa game since fifa 16

game
it feels like a dumb version of fifa 16 the game feels the same automatic and easy to play
the first time i played the game against the ai i set it to legendary level and trashed madrid 30 with bayern


visual
only the effects and textures are improved nothing more the graphic model looks almost the same with poor optimization

fifa 16 with the season update mod is still superior to this rubbish
what has ea been doing all this time
now i understand all the negative comments from all the players over the years

#####

its fifa you will buy it anyway

#####

if you want to have the record of most controllers broken within the shortest amount of time this game is for you

#####

pay2win like every year which is perfect for stupid people like me

#####
















#####

this game runs terribly on my amd rx 7900 xtx and im checking for driver updates every day were mainly playing clubs when a game starts the frame rate grinds down to 7 fps for about 20 seconds and i cant even play the game itll also do that between cut scene transition to gameplay its so poorly optimized for pc not to mention how bad the ai is in this game its just all atrocious and its really egregious that they charge 70 for this game 

also let me play this game on linux fix the anticheat to let me play on linux since windows is trash

#####

very good game in the first 5 hours i broke my controller
4 months later i broke my monitor

#####

honestly the worst game i have played ever do not buy this piece of crap id rather eat a bucket of nails and shit them out just to get the 130 hours of my life back playing this

#####

cant sex the woman

#####

the game runs horribly removal of many tweakable graphics options constant stuttering at any graphical configuration removal of the fifa name delivering a half baked game and engine and the most egregious price increase they just reorganize the ui in a new but ultimately less desirable way and charge you full price and then some every year the game only has to exist these days because there is no competition do not fall for eas continued micro transaction card collection garbage output

#####

honestly its just full of bugs poorly optimized for pc the same incidents keep happening as 7 or so years ago but ea thinks its better to just put in new packs and kits instead of fixing the bugsif you have a secondary screen the game can randomly crash the menu stops responding sometimes if you are using the hubthey are rewarding toxicity as alwaysive been playing with fifa since fifa 12 and its progressively getting worsedo yourself a favor and dont buy this game

#####

what a nice game surely itll be working perfectly fine on launch day

#####

littered with bugs same game as 2016 why do i do this to myself 1010

#####

trash ass game

#####

obviously this is a new concoction and movement from the move when playing fifa last season and switching to fc24 now its very similar to a new game it doesnt feel like jumping one season but 2 seasons in the future the newest third generation interaction from hypermotion is directly referred to as volumetric the movement is indeed close to real players its implementation in the frosbite engine is really good to be applied to all real players with different physiques which have their own characteristics for each players license right starting from the physical clothing worn and the physical anatomy of the body which is fairly accurate like this is a game with various dimensions of movement what we actually feel is the same as when watching a live match on the field each player character has different characteristics body weight and height which mutually influence their abilities body position according to game tactics and timing it makes more sense that sometimes we as players have difficulty guessing which direction to defend and which direction to exploit its very natural very fluid plus this playstyle is more assertive than the previous traits

but that doesnt compare to the bugs offered to some other random players on the device i play on the most annoying thing is the lowfps bug in cutscenes which tends to not be able to touch the minimum value of 60fps with the right aligned specs i have you can imagine how much nauseatingly i saw 1030 fps which was not constant but had massive ups and downs

in terms of appearance starting from menus fonts and commentators this is indeed eas biggest leap this year everything has been refreshed in such a way that the identity of the newest ea fc can be clearly formed that this is truly a game that cannot be separated from dependence on fifa but there is one thing that i hate to reduce playing this game for a long time because you have to know that in ea fc24 there is no cutscene before the match for the cutscene of appointing the lineup formation and players when entering the field lining up and introduced its disgusting that there are no cutscenes like this even though its normal for football games we play to feel the atmosphere firsthand and we pay according to the facilities available but in fact its not appropriate its really disappointing that ea fc doesnt want to share cutscene lineup or is this intentional to remove it especially for nextgen users bad or rotten for those of you who accept this major flaw i cant consider it minor to be honest

and having entered tu3 since this review was written my proud club chelsea fc which has a licensed contract with ea has not yet received an update on all its jersey kits with a new sponsor officially even though it was introduced to the public long ago last week i really cant think look my flying hours are still low because of everything im telling you

#####

this game is fucking trash

#####

this is a great game if you dont need your controllers anymore 


#####

the game is to bugged to play it don t bother to buy it and the worst part about it is that in every game the game stutters and it feels like the players are in mud and they move slowly

#####

cutbacks fc

#####

new name still sht game aaa company cant even fix the mouse cursor issue and lag spikes xd

#####

here i will leave the cat friends who pass by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards

#####

my honest opinion about the game and just so you know im a 41 year old gamer whos been playing his good share of video games on consoles for a while and have recently switched to pc gaming i know most of the people say its the same thing every year and yeah they are right you are basically buying an update for the teams and their roster every year with a few extra ingame animations almost the same thing most of you probably do when buying call of duty every year now the most important thing about this am i having fun with it so far yes does it work and runs wellsmooth on my set up yes it works perfectly fine with some tweaks of course no stutteringscreen tearing or frame rate drops so in the end its really up to you if you want to buy it and try it just make sure your set up can run it please besides you dont have to buy every single fifa title every year same thing with call of duty you can always take a break from them every 1 or 2 years and you will see you will have fun the next time you buy those games its what i do and i suggest you do the same otherwise you are gonna end up getting tired and hating on the franchise

#####

wohooo cant wait to want to kill myself yeaaahhh lets go babyyy

#####

this game is terrible i will still play it

#####

بؤءلال

#####

money down the drain

#####

this is not only the worst fifa ive ever played this is the worse game ive ever played
1 there are no casuals left
 literally everybody is lying in a pool full of sweat giving their soul to beat you everyone has youtube tactics knows corners and kick off routines everything that is a glitch is used by the community religiously
2 there is no football in this game
this is not football i cant even compare it to something some people said its ping pong its close but not as good the ball just jumps around and gets caught between players where it switches possession about 5 times in 10 seconds which will drive you mad the meta is run down the line and pass it into the center to score in the empty net this happens every fucking game man every game people dont play originally at all they just play the same idiotic tactic that works and good riddance 
3 this is not a game this is a work place
you play games to have fun the football in this game is not fun its madness inducing the slots they have in the game are fun so you basically go to work play the football in the game to get to the fun part the slots machines
4 the middle of the pitch doesnt exist 
you just cant play down the middle nothing goes through the chance of you completing a through pass through the middle are zero so thats basically why everyone plays down the wing and passes into the box because its almost the only way to score most people spin 7 times in the same place until you do a mistake and pass it its ridiculous 
5 the pressing tactics are crazy
there is a glitch that goes like this u go 71 depth or above and the whole game ur team presses like mad the issues is everyone has it activated which gives you absolutely no time to relax ur under constant stress during the whole game very very very very very very bad experience 
6 if your team isnt meta forget about it
you cant play this game seriously unless ur team is goated players like mbape for example just ghost through your defense and if u play the game long enough you see all the keepers dive the opposite way when he is shooting
7call it dda call it scripting idk but there is something
every time you hit the bar the ball comes back to your player so you can score if you go up 50 ur opponent team becomes insane your team start acting like idiots while ur opponents team becomes godly i was down 40 this year and managed to beat my opponent 76 i was way worse than him the game literally carried me yesterday my opponent was 50 i activated constant pressure and came back and it ended 55 with me almost winning the game in the last minute this is not normal
8 the game is infested with hackers
there are so many hackers i need a fucking book to explain how many shit goes on in this game
9 you wont see the good players unless you spend thousands
ive been playing ut since fifa 14 and trust me you dont get good players you just dont doesnt matter what u grind how much u play unless you take out that credit card u wont have the team u want
10the worse part is ea doesnt mind any of this issues
they just dont care there are hundreds of issues i could add to this topic but it would take too much time from my life for a piece of shit game that will never be good

this game sucks bro honestly waste of money the developer is fucking lazy as fuck all the company wants is money nothing new to this game but if there is anything new this game is getting more and more terrible each year fuck this game im gonna sue this game for fucking up my mental health fuck everyone that were involved in making this game fuck u fuck u fuck u

no lineup no player stadium walk in no champions league anthem cant change refresh rate

pros from my perspective 
the menu feels much more responsive and faster
the evolution of players in ultimate team is a great idea
removing position changes is great
game feels a bit more responsive but that could just be because its the first week
love the new cameras and how it shows during gameplay the shooting stats and different statistic

cons 
goalkeepers are useless
goals from every angle
kick off momentum is still there and will always be there
ultimate team feels like some sort of volta now all those new female players with super ratings  the 15 meter female midget outpacing and pushing aside my van dijk seems unreal and unrealistic even for a video game that claims to simulate football i love this game and will continue playing but its just ridiculous i don t mind having them introduced but make realistic ratings which will never happen because no one will play them anymore so probably the fifa community will just have to suck it up i get that they want to push gender equality but whats going to be next make them literally 1 foot taller so that they could win headers easier

trash game

#####

this game is a disgrace to the fifa franchise passes are immensely painful inaccurate 70 of the time are either with not enough power or way too much power players are tremendously clumsy takes years to spin around or simply change direction any activity that requires the player to dispose of the ball takes even longer pass shoot cross etc even stopping the damn ball is extremely difficult apparently for the players half the time the ball randomly bounces off of the players footkneeheadchestwhatever and ends up in the opponent the gameplay on defense is close to impossible unless somehow you find a way to control 3 players at once  ai controlled players on your team do not make any moves in defense like the opponent can literally enter the box with you having 5 players inside the will just stay in one place will not make any move to the ball to the player with the ball to cover passing lanes in the slightest to cover the other enemy players all and all the gameplay is anything but enjoyable definitely worst fifa game of the last 10 years in my opinion

strongly recommend not buying this crap even though i bought this game on sale for 14 eur i regret spending the money on it

#####

ea sucks

update ea still sucks

#####

i purchased this game primarily to enjoy the cut scenes and cinematics in career mode and to occasionally play with friends my expectations were not even high yet disappointingly the game failed to meet even these the frequent crashes and lags prevented me from enjoying these basic features its obvious that the game is not welloptimized for pc i would advise against purchasing it due to its subpar performancerubbish

#####

fc handicap 24

#####

this is the worst ea football game to ever exist the gameplay is so fued up and ddascripting in this game is on another level also the servers are so terrible and this game has the worst ever community people only use meta cards every year they are not even trying to have fun every guy i play against have basically the same team abusing finesse shots play style with son salah or griezmann or doing cutbacks only all game with 71 depth tactics also to mention if youre not spending any money on this game forget about packing crazy cards  ea lowered pack weight so much that you cant even pack special cards and barely pack any walkouts 86 and above dont even think about buying this game youre going to waste your time and money in short  this game is absolute garbage and shouldnt exist  at least if ea is the company that made it they have ruined this game and still are continuing to do so every year even more

#####

indian call centers must envy ea with the number of people they manage to scam every year they changed the name but the crap is the same not even the smell has changed there have been slight changes in career mode some things that ive seen suggested since fifa 16 or 17 but since copying the game code from the previous year cant be too difficult the ea staff doesnt seem to spend much time on the internet and they dont seem to read the communitys suggestions the handicap is disgusting this year one of the worst atrocities ive seen in terms of handicap both in online and singleplayer modes its an assault on anyones mental health they must have some contract with gamepad and monitor manufacturers almost certainly

honestly i only bought this absolute garbage because i had extra money in my account from csgo drops otherwise dont waste even 30 on this trash 70 for this is ridiculous lmao
i cant wait for a game thats worthy competition for this garbage

#####

 

#####

i just cannot fathom how much the company dont care at all i have been playing fifa 22 and did not buy 23 yet there was a bug instant replay present two years ago and still exists in this version 
the crazy thing is that it used to work fine in older version of fifa years ago 
also discovered a new bug in the menu to choose to fire the coach the coach with expertise in different playing styles i cannot choose yes or cancel it is just stuck there not frozen or crashing just stuck in the menu where i can highlight the two options and i can choose neither pressing any button does nothing i had to force quit the game

#####

pros
 playing volta football is much fun for me at least
 player agent in player career is a great idea but could be better
 i really enjoy playing the career mode the most and the volta one else i would not have bought the game at all
 pro club is a great mode to play with your friends and build your own team great opportunity to avoid all the botsai if you have your friends andor randoms to join

cons
 always the same game good features will be removed new are coming in even if they are good the older good ones are still missing
 ai always does the same boring thing always from the wings into the middle no flanking no outside of the box nothing special besides all the same this isnt even happening in real life so wtf did you program your ai this badly enemies and users ai
 i really do not understand the ai movements even on the highest level 
they all behave like in the point above and also even if they have a good opportunity to shoot they are not even trying or instead of passing the ball the ai always gives the hardest to not lose the ball even though my teammates are on the ball just in the last second it passes the ball such a weird ai behavior in any of the fifas i dont remember fifa 23 being that ai weird 
 no matter which newest fifa and fc24 the goalkeeper position looses always unnecessary points for nothing playing as a goalkeeper in a players career is a horror you can basically do nothing because your team has the ball and is about to attack your points become less for what this is so dumb it is not the goalkeepers fault if nothing happens in front of the goal like come on but if you make one mistake and let the ball go inside of your goal even after a save your points are getting drained drastically this was way better in the older versions from fifa
 only stupid ea and fifa switchingsubbing out the goalkeepers because of the lack that the game understands how to give away proper points for the goalkeeper 
 not worth 70 at all waste of money 14 are still too much but way better than 70 for the same shitty game every year  i only keep buying it because i really loved the good old fifa games i started with the game from 2007 so i want my collection expanded 
 if you dont have the money for this game dont worry your money will be better saved you miss nothing with buying this game at all
 and of course as we all know some bugs and glitches really loved to see all the time what my objectives are while playing on the pitch
 camera floats into the stadium before it reaches me as a goalkeeper as well as a flag going through the display
 also i had the bugglitch where the scoring board is only filled up with information which happened in the game way before and stays until the half is over for some reason 
 for some reason ea decided to delete the option how often the ai will attack i am pretty sure it still was in 23 it is very sad because this was essential for being a goalkeeper
 had a bugglitch where after an injury from the opponents team was whistled and we got the ball to play again with my goalkeeper was struggling behind the goal to go away from it wow

i wont touch the ultimate team at all because scam with all the packs and so on if it is still like i saw in videos or streams with disconnecting for no reason or so on nah

conclusion 
for the general do not buy the game for the full price absolutely a lot of waste with 70 you get way better games and not only one even if i do not recommend the game at all if you still want to get it wait for the best discount 
for those who do not care and just want to collect all the fifa titles get it but still consider buying for a reasonable price not the full one for sure
there is probably much more to say especially negatively but i am done with this review of this game 


what can i say i will sadly stick to this franchise no matter what and i still have at least some fun it is a hatelove just like with rainbow six siege for me so i give it at least 510

i have an addiction

#####

ea fc 24  a game marred by glitches and bugs

i recently had the chance to play the latest release of ea fc 24 and while there are certainly aspects to appreciate in the game i couldnt help but be disappointed by the numerous glitches and bugs that plague the experience

the good

1 improved gameplay ea fc 24 does bring some improvements in terms of gameplay mechanics including better ball control and more realistic player movements

2 graphics the game boasts impressive visuals capturing the essence of football with lifelike player models and stadiums

3 new skill moves ea sports has added new skill moves to the game which adds some variety to your gameplay strategies

the bad

1 bugs and glitches this is where ea fc 24 falters the game is riddled with bugs and glitches ranging from minor annoyances to gamebreaking issues no commentary bugs freezing and crashes are common

2 unplayability some players have found the game virtually unplayable due to these issues having to restart it multiple times just to enjoy a session

in conclusion ea fc 24 has the potential to be a great football game but its current state is marred by technical issues that hinder the overall experience ea sports should prioritize fixing these bugs to make it the game it has the potential to be until then i would suggest to hold off on purchasing or wait for updates to address these issues

#####

this game still shit not optimize for pc and lot of cheater fuck ea i will not buy this game unless it got 80 discounts in the future my condolence to all the old style fifa fans out there for buying this shit this game should be free dont waste you money buying this trash

#####

literally trash fill with bug insanely depressed to play

#####

you are getting kicked out of the game at random stages 50 minute 60 75 87  dont care the opponent can leave during penalty before you can shoot insane laggs and the defending is the worst 

poorly optimised and just a bad game in general 


i just keep on playing it because ive spent 80 on it and it will for sure be my last game of the series

#####

its ok but it has so many frame drops

#####

this game force my computer restart when launching cant go through the first scene of the game 
please apply the fix soon please

#####

they didnt fix the glitches they didnt fix anything they just want your money

#####

new name same dogshit

#####

the amount of glitches and broken menus is unbelievable  i swear this is worst than fifa 23 and by miles  trash company 

#####

bring back player walkouts wanna feel champions league song to the bone
every year there is one special mistake that ea does not wanna fix or address
i would buy another footbal game if there was available we need new companies to start makin football game for us because ea for straight years did not fixed same bugs its just out of control at this point

i dont have to pay a game loads of money and search fixes  i just need to double click and play it ea
i would not recommend people to buy it at this moment mine was standart edition at least poor people who payed full price for 7 days early more than half could not play the game with issues at hand xd

#####

bad game

#####

i know ea gets a lot of hate but personally i dont think it gets enough

#####

im sure you guys didnt do anything for this game too many bugs with a big game title and company you guys should all be ashamed 

#####

same sh1t different title

terrible game horrible graphics horrible ultimate team dont waste money on this shit game

#####

all you need to know about the game

1 all packs will contain 70 of noname woman players and all of them are stronger faster than males 
2 if game will decide that you have to lose  you will players with 90 pace cant do nothing against 82
3 worst defence system that ive seen in fifa all your goals that you will get to your net its just run forward througt your defence and nobody cant stop anybody no matter which defence you have or scheme or tactic
4 gandicaps
5 plus comparing with fifa 23 is optimization and graphics  now pitch doesns look like texture from fifa 08

#####

while its sporting a new look and name ea sports fc 24 is a familiar and altogether solid entry in the juggernaut that is eas annual soccer video game series picking up the controller for a quick session with mates feels as comfortable and natural as it ever has with plenty of mechanical depth for hardcore football fanatics to obsess over  
ea sports fc 24 is a true celebration of the worlds game with plenty of content for longtime fans and newcomers alike

#####

fifa but new name

#####

bellingoooaaaaal

#####

who ever ea is paying to optimize this for pc should be ashamed this is not only an horrible experience to open it saddens me that there are people who got paid to make this work on pc

#####

great game ea still need to fix the random menu bug when suddenly cant scroll around other playmodes  anything forces us to restart the game otherwise it wont work its playable im not getting any lags in my opinion its more stable than last years fifa anticheat is working normally now not crashing not freezing 

the only issue for me is when i launch the game directly from steam it cant connect to the ea servers need to launch it from the ea application not much of a big deal tbh so i wouldnt say it as a problem

#####

a company worth 33 billion dollars and still cant release a finished product

#####

one match is enough to remind myself why i hate this series so much nothing ever gets better just every mode gets more bloated and bloated and the entire thing is kept alive by idiot children buying face cards of millionaires in different coulours because shiny things attract stupid people

#####

i am usually not a violent man this game got me punching my monitor throwing my controllers against the wall punching my door punching my gf and its not even fun only good things are packs everything else is useless

#####

ctrlc  ctrlv

#####

h1 crashes out worse than united in cup competitions this season h1

i bought it on winter sale since the player career mode looked interesting it was better than recent years and scripting has also been less apparent compared to 21 and 22

that is if you can even play the game for 10 minutes straight you will get random crashes each time and b exactly the same 3 fking files will get corrupted b and you have to verify them with steam each and every time before you launch the game 

it becomes quite tedious and bloody frustrating especially when it crashes on the one occasion that you are i leading 10 against city with a mid table championship team in the 88th minute in the fa cup i

have played fifa since 06 only skipped fifa 23 in nearly 17 years 

h2 big mistake in coming back to this series h2

#####

ea cannot make ui
ea cannot make playable games
ea charges what for said games xd are you having a laugh ea you were never really ever that funny  like never ever funny  

i remember you ea from the 90s you bought up all those studios you knew then that you didnt have to do anything to be something you just had to be a rich boy hadnt you yeah  

but you know what you cant get with money ea brains that you cannot buy with money you have to work at it mate to get good you cannot get good if you dont want to get good 
and you aint good no far from it ea you down in the gutter and it dont matter how rich you are since this game you aint winning

#####

why do you guys still support this abomination

#####

defending isnt there literally same copy and pasted fifa dont buy

#####

feel free to call me an idiot cuz ive bought this game

#####

ive had 5 hours in this game and still got a refund thank you anya
game 2  10
steam support 10  10

#####

was unable to get past the main menu game thinks i have two controllers  connected when i only have one so i was unable to play even a single match

#####

i have spent months literal months trying again and again to get this game to work any time i think hey i really miss playing fifa and attempt to get this game to work again i end up disappointed and angry each time i load up this game it will freeze andor crash fairly immediately i got in one career mode session when i first bought this game to the end of the summer transfer window since then i have not been able to get past the game mode menus i have tried every fixtroubleshooting guide i have found online updating drivers deleting the appdata verifying the game files steamgame reinstalls etc nothing has worked do not buy this game or at the very least not on pc it is a broken piece of garbage 

also shame on you valvesteamea whoever for denying my refund request just because i got in one game session over 2 hours one time i cant get my money back for a game that literally will not work at all not it runs poorly not its a bad game it does not work in the slightest maybe once since december ive gotten to start a match and it crashed within the first half respectfully give me my money back and whoever is thinking about buying this game do not do that

#####

new title same problem

#####

game is not launching

#####

just no

#####

trash

#####

stopped launching since new update now i cant launch my game thank you for doing good things 

#####

last fifa i played was fifa 16 
i didnt play any fifa in 7 years for sure there must be some changes
nop
boring ass gameplay
stutters on every cutscene unless you put render settings on medium or low using 5800x3d  6950xt
pro clubs is filled with clowns wearing glasses and tattoos and rainbow hair
volta crashes every 2nd match
popups nonstop for ultimate team

dont bother unless youre a little kid that screams siuuuuuuuuuuuuu and thinks youre cool

#####

this game is so fucking bad

#####

same game evey year same bugs same meta oh no meta changed its worse no need to control defenders now just let ia do the job
game is unstable has crashes controllers issues

#####

worst fifa ever 100e game btw

#####

this the trashest game i have even played in my 15 years in gaming gameplay is tragic the one with richer mom wins every single game and it hurt you to play it i wouldnt recomment to play it even if it was free

#####

نگاه این گیم یه ریدمان کامله به تمام معناس شاید با ابدیتا درست شه ولی بعد میدونم شوتا عجیبن دریبلینگ به گا رفته طرف میخواد پا بندازه بازیکنش از 2 متری بازی کنت روت شارژ میکنه خطا هم نمیگیره تازه پی تو وینم هست 1 ماه نشده گیم اومده طرف تیمش پله داره رونالدو داره

#####

scamming company 

too many people who bought the ultimate edition cant access on ultimate team mode for a week and they try to ask to ea support services for helping them to fix the issues but ea does nothing until those people can access ultimate team mode after the standard edition has released

omg


#####

for pc players it is literally hell for fps with actual gaming pcs i waited for the first pc update and the stability increased by 5 percent max the cutscenes corners celebrations freekicks etc freeze your game for several seconds at a time while your opponent continues to play the only thing that improved is the full crashing and screen tearing fps is unstable in every mode even in the damn default homepage with kerr its lagging keep in mind this shit happened before the update and still occurs after the update keep in mind these are people who paid extra to play early i waited for the official release and not just the first pc update and still very very minor improvements as detailed above the game is still unplayable for majority of pc base

#####

this is scripted matrix to donate

#####

like the last 8 years of fifa this game fully focuses on ultimate team so if you have no interest in ut this game is at the absolute best a 410 and that mainly because the game has crossplay in pro clubs

if you buy the game for ultimate team this game is actually not bad the addition of evolutions and playstyles make this game a lot more enjoyable 

evolutions can make low rated cards useful even overpowered sometimes

playstyles are like traits form old fifas but way more interesting and useful you can have up to 7 playstyles on a single normal card and one of them can be playstyle  playstyle  are upgraded version of any playstyle

the gameplay is meh 

overall rating 310 ut 6510
if you dont care for ultimate team its not worth getting just play fifa 23 or wait for a big discount
if you care for ultimate team its not bad you will enjoy yourself just dont take the game too seriously

#####

worst game full of bugs full of glitches full of lags and  what a scam
ea game is just a trash company believe me

#####

i ignored all of the negative reviews and decided to try it myself 
1 huge download size
2 long time to start a game
3 not a friendly userinterface too many options
4 slow frame rate on my new laptop


#####

career mode neglected in favour of fut gambling cash cow proton support apparently deliberately not available making it unplayable on steam deck

#####

the game is fine but

its about 5 years too late with the cross play roll out for pro clubs ea saved money by not affiliating and made their game more expensive and fut is a joke also struggling to load into games rn


we will play it anyway coz we love football but hopefully konami will step up their game soon

edit  requested refund after playing pro clubs loading screen simulator for about 5 hours after review game  just isnt finished depending on what your trying to do

2nd edit   refund rejected

#####

overall the game is really nice graphics are great but optimization needs work
the optimization for the game is horrid with top end equipment its stuttery and laggy so it needs a fix other than that all i really have to say is that soundtrack wise 2324

#####

please dont buy

#####

the game becomes a slide show when a cutscene comes on no matter what specs i have ea fix your game

#####

ea games is the worst company ever they only care about milking profits out of dumb people who keep buying fut packsloot boxes the offline game modes are still shit ai just scores scripted goals that would be impossible otherwise a player with 65 overall can play as good as kane just because it is scripted that the game has to be hard and the ai side has to win dont but it i hope they go bankrupt

#####

both pes and fifa suck but after trying out fc24 im convinced efootball is superior

#####

it is the worst game i have ever played in my life whoever made the idea that for some random periods of time to make you experience a game where you are winning 30 in 55th minute then the opposing team scores 4 goals an make it 43 and you try to score a t least once and you hit the crossbar 4 times in a open goal and to make you suffer more when you go in for a challenge for the ball the defender gets a red card so i cant use him next game and a pen and he scores whoever made this game like this there is truly a special most vile disgusting place in hell for them

#####

shit game buggy dont buy it no matter how tempted you are trying to get a refund rn 


#####

stop buying shit every years

#####

if you play offline like me this game will insult your intelligence you will see how your player sabotages your way to the goal or when your 94 overall player suddenly becomes a sixtyyearold with arthritis moving like a person who just had a stroke so you wonder if you have fielded the strongest team or you are playing with newly promoted juniors because there is no competition i am unfortunately forced to play this abomination of a game

#####

fkn terrible 

#####

women

#####

now for kicking a woman you will get a maximum red card

#####

dont play this game waste of your time spend that time for urself ur family

#####

the gameplay is janky the passes and the runs are literally against what most player wanted the game to do just go on youtube and search ea fc 24 is bad and everyone would understand why
the career mode is starving for contents and instead being served with a million bugs waiting til eternity to be fixed from the players and managers faces the kits the stadium even the mode itself is dying ea only cares about fut where they can squish every last penny from the gamers fuck this shit and fuck you ea

#####

fk ea

#####

trash

playing this game after paying 70 for it i honestly feel robbed when i first got on i wasnt even able to play with my friends on xbox due to an update causing the crossplay feature to break once that got fixed we would get errors nearly every time wed queue up for a match wed have to leave and rejoin the lobby every single time and hope that it would happen to actually put us in a match the menus are also atrocious  it seems like ea tried to design them in the most confusing way possible it is extremely annoying how you have to enter a 1015 second loading screen between each section of the menu if you want to adjust simple settings like video brightness or audio volume you have to back out all the way to the main menu screen to do it during halftime within games you have to press three buttons to skip the cutscene with a delay between each button i genuinely dont understand why it would be necessary to press so many buttons to perform one action 

the gameplay feels really bad too there were so many games were we needlessly lost the ballgot scored on because of server lag the bots that are placed on your team are pretty much braindead passing the ball to the enemy team at every opportunity it is extremely frustrating to make impressive difficult plays only for it all to be ruined by a bot giving the ball away also if you dont have the right stats your character will pretty much lose every game they will not win duels make goals or even pass the ball correctly if you dont have the perfect characteristics whats the point of all the customization if only one setup will work well i dont feel any sort of satisfaction from this game whatsoever it is so poorly designed that trying to invest time to improve would just be a waste

espero que todos os envolvidos no projeto morram com cancro

#####

cant save my games or personal setting files tired to fix it nothing worked tired to get my money back couldnt  nice game ea

#####

tbh i like looking at my team rather then playing the game

unless suffering is the direct and immediate object of life our existence must entirely fail of its aim it is absurd to look upon the enormous amount of pain that abounds everywhere in the world and originates in needs and necessities inseparable from life itself as serving no purpose at all and the result of mere chance each separate misfortune as it comes seems no doubt to be something exceptional but misfortune in general is the rule

i know of no greater absurdity than that propounded by most systems of philosophy in declaring evil to be negative in its character evil is just what is positive it makes its own existence felt leibnitz is particularly concerned to defend this absurdity and he seeks to strengthen his position by using a palpable and paltry sophism it is the good which is negative in other words happiness and satisfaction always imply some desire fulfilled some state of pain brought to an end

this explains the fact that we generally find pleasure to be not nearly so pleasant as we expected and pain very much more painful

the pleasure in this world it has been said outweighs the pain or at any rate there is an even balance between the two if the reader wishes to see shortly whether this statement is true let him compare the respective feelings of two animals one of which is engaged in eating the other

the best consolation in misfortune or affliction of any kind will be the thought of other people who are in a still worse plight than yourself and this is a form of consolation open to every one but what an awful fate this means for mankind as a whole

we are like lambs in a field disporting themselves under the eye of the butcher who chooses out first one and then another for his prey so it is that in our good days we are all unconscious of the evil fate may have presently in store for us  sickness poverty mutilation loss of sight or reason

no little part of the torment of existence lies in this that time is continually pressing upon us never letting us take breath but always coming after us like a taskmaster with a whip if at any moment time stays his hand it is only when we are delivered over to the misery of boredom

but misfortune has its uses for as our bodily frame would burst asunder if the pressure of the atmosphere was removed so if the lives of men were relieved of all need hardship and adversity if everything they took in hand were successful they would be so swollen with arrogance that though they might not burst they would present the spectacle of unbridled follynay they would go mad and i may say further that a certain amount of care or pain or trouble is necessary for every man at all times a ship without ballast is unstable and will not go straight

certain it is that work worry labor and trouble form the lot of almost all men their whole life long but if all wishes were fulfilled as soon as they arose how would men occupy their lives what would they do with their time if the world were a paradise of luxury and ease a land flowing with milk and honey where every jack obtained his jill at once and without any difficulty men would either die of boredom or hang themselves or there would be wars massacres and murders so that in the end mankind would inflict more suffering on itself than it has now to accept at the hands of nature

in early youth as we contemplate our coming life we are like children in a theatre before the curtain is raised sitting there in high spirits and eagerly waiting for the play to begin it is a blessing that we do not know what is really going to happen could we foresee it there are times when children might seem like innocent prisoners condemned not to death but to life and as yet all unconscious of what their sentence means nevertheless every man desires to reach old age in other words a state of life of which it may be said it is bad today and it will be worse tomorrow and so on till the worst of all

if you try to imagine as nearly as you can what an amount of misery pain and suffering of every kind the sun shines upon in its course you will admit that it would be much better if on the earth as little as on the moon the sun were able to call forth the phenomena of life and if here as there the surface were still in a crystalline state

again you may look upon life as an unprofitable episode disturbing the blessed calm of nonexistence and in any case even though things have gone with you tolerably well the longer you live the more clearly you will feel that on the whole life is a disappointment nay a cheat

if two men who were friends in their youth meet again when they are old after being separated for a lifetime the chief feeling they will have at the sight of each other will be one of complete disappointment at life as a whole because their thoughts will be carried back to that earlier time when life seemed so fair as it lay spread out before them in the rosy light of dawn promised so much  and then performed so little this feeling will so completely predominate over every other that they will not even consider it necessary to give it words but on either side it will be silently assumed and form the groundwork of all they have to talk about

he who lives to see two or three generations is like a man who sits some time in the conjurers booth at a fair and witnesses the performance twice or thrice in succession the tricks were meant to be seen only once and when they are no longer a novelty and cease to deceive their effect is gone

while no man is much to be envied for his lot there are countless numbers whose fate is to be deplored



#####

same fifa same issues

#####

everything in this game manages to be a physical joke the ball in many moments is illogical the artificial intelligence is horrible especially in defense players where they become idiots to make a simple mark and the goalkeepers take a lot of goals that in real life football would be impossible to happen and the other problem is that this game is extremely buggy and ea doesnt do the least to fix this showing the companys disregard for the game they only care about launching cards in their casino 

i dont recommend this game to anyone who has some sort of self respect

#####

this game is good on other devices accept for pc because they have to fix the ea launncher then this game would be very good


#####

1 same gameplay
2 most of players dont have scanned faces
3 impossible defense  no where near real football
4 fake events where the ai scores no matter what

#####

scam of the century

#####

this game is utter trash thank god i tried it in play for freeweekend and didnt spend a cent for it

1 visual bugs cant play moments in fut disconnecting every second game 
2 menu bugs and crashes all day long
3 women in fut i mean nobody asked for this only some pro girls but you never asked the real players about that

this is by far the worst fifa experience ive ever had and it means something oh true it isnt fifa anymore ok

you should be ashamed if you bought this game and didnt refund it

#####

scripted ai

#####

i am going to rack up over 300 hours on this game over the next 12 months and despite that i strongly recommend that nobody buys this game

i am addicted and i need to fix that but if you are away from this game then please keep it that way

#####

crash crash crash

#####

not sure if a freetoplay weekend was the greatest idea i had been thinking of buying this in the sale but after trying it i wont waste my money on it lets just go on what i already experienced just in the first hour

 play is laggy if i can play cyberpunk on high graphical settings theres no reason this shouldnt be equally as smooth
 its supposed to have great controller support i play with an xbox controller and navigation was absolutely awful
 match play was terrible the opposition scored because their defensive midfielder made a straight run towards goal and my entire defense opened up like it was moses parting the red sea there was all kinds of weird stuff happening on both sides

the best thing i can say is that the freetoplay weekend saved me 20 euros because i wont be buying this

#####

fuck momentum fuck that disgusting momentum over and over again the worlds shitty game

#####

needs to improve home and away match transition we should be able to directly move to next match rather than quitting

#####

the most trash game in the whole planet


#####

fifa 23 was a step in the right direction fc 24 feels like 2 steps backwards from that fut pc transfer market is still separated from consoles meaning theres barely anything to buy on pc mouse keeps being automatically locked in the middle while idle resulting in controllersjoysticks not working in some menus they removed players cutscenes walking out onto the pitch and lining up before a game etc theres a lot of problems i could list but its not worth my time
 btw about the women in fut drama women mixed with men sounds like itll be a fun alternative for people tired of the same however i see why its considered by many as forced diversity if it was difficult to pack your favorite players before now imagine in fc24 where therell be a lot of extra wsl players in fut packs personally i dont care but it could be easily fixed if devs separated women  men packs so you get 10x 83 with only women or only men depending of what you choose but of course they wont do it because they want people failing to pack their favorite players more packs being opened  more money spent by players  more money for them 
oh and theyve said they will close fifa 21 servers in november 2023 so maybe they will close fc 24 servers on november 2026  and every year around september they purposefully take out the specials cards from the 10x 85 packs basically only giving you shitty gold players at the end of the lifespan of fut so you buy the next game instead thats a shitty move by them and i think more people should be aware of their scummy tactics
anyways ill keep playing fifa 23

#####

id like to post a honest review but i will get banned from steam not even worth the 13 bucks i paid for it

#####

scripted dont play ut

#####

needs improvement but still fun to play

#####

terrible laggy game unplayable

#####

what a joke

#####

50 off not even 2 months after release tells you everything you need to know
might be the worst game ive ever played brilliant bob clears this pile of trash

#####

unplayable

#####

how bad can this game be this the worst fifa by far

#####

how is it possible that they get worse every year

#####

welcome to my ted talk

this game makes purchasing the newer cod games worth it 

thank you for coming to my ted talk

#####

ea thank u for this horrible game
they sells the same game every year with different rosters they dont care about the players at all
the only thing they care about is packs and your money 
secondly this  version is full of bugs the referee acting weird there is many fouls and penalties who does not give them  really this game affects mental health

#####

dont buy it

#####

cant even get this game to load

#####

sucks and  the support team sucks banned my account twice for no reason and wont tell the reasom why

#####

dogshit

#####

women in ultimate team thats simply awful

#####

i purchased this game because i still had hope that ea wouldt be that cash grab hungry fkn disgrace of a company but ive been proven wrong

what do i mean

since team of the year players came out the game is broken for me who isnt ready to spend a single penny on in game purchases you are unfortunately going to fall behind 
weekend league rewards is mediocre at best while purchasing packs for fifa points will give you an huge advantage

fut is really the definition of pay to win and its sad 
career mode or normal online play is the only thing i can recommend 

however if you are one of those sweaty mfs who thinks that you get some type of clout for having sick player on fut this game is for you 

#####

one more griddy and i will end it all just kidding guys but no this game is horrible

#####

a good game to play if you ever feel suicidal

#####

controller sometimes does not recognize input in menu
if you play with a controller the mouse input overwrites your controller input even if you dont touch the mouse

#####

fifa 17 70

#####

game crashes all the time takes forever to load onto the game controller input delay just buy it on xbox or ps

#####

different year same crap

#####

rigged and buggy mess 99 of the dev work goes into generating packs for the gambling addicts

#####

even to really good players the game is basically a game of rock paper scissors or just awful rebounds and unrealistic things i wouldnt make my worst enemy play this game

#####

trash game keeps stuttering whenever i pause the game ea dont even care about their own game fix your fkin game ea why do i even bother buying this game in the first place

#####

please anyone please do not get this game the controls are shit i could not change the brightness and the players look potato as shit please better off playing roblox

#####

010 sh1t  always crashing on start ez refund money

#####

horrible game

#####

fuck this game you could have nasa wifi and this shit would still lag its so stupid how your game will lag and the opponent scores 3 goals while youre waiting for the gameplay to catch up with itself it makes this shitty game unplayable and the gameplay isnt even good its so clunky and you cant even switch or pass to the right player half the time and every time i go in for a tackle ea just says fuck you and gives them the ball right back and the amount of scripted shit that goes on in this game is unimaginable like why does my defense play so good the entire match and then play like they have autism in the 90th minute this game is straight up dog shit it makes fifa 23 look like a fucking masterpiece fuck you ea fuck the pay to win faggots and fuck the people that say this game is good cause they are fucking brain dead

#####

game always crashes been ban without solid reason bad customer service from ea

#####

play football manager instead of this hot garbage

#####

very bad no changes from fifa 23 dont buy this shit

#####

you cannot shoot people here

#####

worst fifa ive played in my life i think its time to retire instead of a game getting better every year this game only gets worse i wish the worst upon the makers letting me pay 90 euro for this  pathetic game its not even worth 20 in my opinion

#####

do not waste your time

pc support is nonexistent with controller  input issues shame that a large developer like ea cant even get the control options correct in the ui

#####

fc24 bugs life edition

#####

23 was an absolute joke with game is getting more and more pay to win 24 on the other hand theres no further place these money hungry greedy publishers can go in terms of p2w servers are inconsistent menus are so broken if you get an injury in squad battles pause menu that shows up is from fifa 23 

things new with fc 24 as follows

a playstyle mechanic that determines what does a player do good or bad a player with 40 defending with raccoon playstyle is a better defender than a player with 99 defending without it 

goalkeepers that never played a single game in their life every shot on target will end up in a deflection and will be scored if it was possible itd be better to play with and extra defender rather than having a keeper in this game

sounds that you cant turn off before games team anthems are always on 100 volume so even if you put the ingame setting for musics to 0 and general sound to 1 itll damage your ears with garbage music

rubberbanding this year with potato servers helping you will have players on the ground after a tackle taking powershots before getting up you will have players run through others like a ghost you will have your keeper release a ball that theyve saved get up and tried to dive for it again only to make the ball go behind them for an open goal

#####

o jogo é extremamente bugado o controle fica parando de funcionar exclusivamente no pro clubs  e além disso tudo ainda tem o fato do ultimate team ser um modo de arrancar dinheiro comprei o jogo por 70 reais na promoção e ainda foi caro demais 20 reais e um abraço ainda ficava um pouco salgado
