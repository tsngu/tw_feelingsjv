this bait and switch should be illegal  
 to start off this was originally announced as a free update to ark survival evolved that was a lie then it was a free expansion for people who purchased ark 2 that was also a lie it was then announced that it would be a one time payment and you get all expansions free with it another lie

 i have thousands of hours in ase and have purchased every dlcseason pass so obviously i love ark but i purchased this upgrade thinking ok i paid for a graphics update and integrated mods and while i wasnt happy about that i decided to pay the one time purchase price yet here we are again now not only did everyone have to pay for the engine update that was supposed to be free they are now locking items and dinos behind paywalls on official servers 

 every week i come back to check the game they are asking for more money  and to top it off they said before release that the new unreal 5 engine would make the game less buggy and run a lot better than the original ark it does not it is way worse and it has exploits that were fixed years ago in ase they just copy pasted old code

  i know i sound like a baby right now but these people have lied to their community too many times and i wish i could get a refund i tried i paid for what was supposed to be a free upgrade and was told it would be the only payment now they ask for more and cant even make the game run properly it should be taken off steam imo im sick of being scammed by shady companies like this  
 
 and yes i know leaving a negative review will probably get me banned from the official servers and discord because thats what kind of company this is

just thought id help out with peoples frames by this review use this command rvolumetriccloud 0 it removes the clouds youll be looking at double the frames and you can use 

rstreamingpoolsize 0 unlocks ur whole gpu memory

rnanitemaxpixelsperedge 4 reduces triangles for nanite meshes

rlumenscreenprobegatherradiancecacheproberesolution 16 optimizes lumen

rdynamicglobalilluminationmethod 2  disables lumen

rvolumetriccloud 0 disables volumetric sky

rshadowquality 0 disables all shadows

these will help with frames but beleive me removing the clouds is a frame changer good luck peeps also i have 7900xtx 7800x3d cpu and ddr5 6600mhz ram and i get about 90100 frames on mediumhigh and when i just remove the clouds i get 190 ive also said the same to tribemates who have alot worse cards and its doubled their frames hope this helps

first of all let me clarify that i was a huge fan of wildcard and the entire ark franchise with over 10000 hours in ark survival evolved and over 1000 hours in ark survival ascended i believe i can provide an informed opinion on whether its worth spending money on this game

one thing to make clear upfront is that ase was in early access until august 29 2017 just like asa is now the first addon scorched earth was sold on september 1 2016 even before the game was finished the ark community was already so large at that time that they didnt hesitate to ask for more money for an unfinished game that was full of bugs and had poor performance which was almost outrageous back then 
the same thing is happening now with asa premium mods adventure packs and soon new addons are being pushed at every opportunity to milk the cash cow

ark survival ascended was touted as a revamped version of ark survival evolved with improved unreal engine 5 resulting in performance gains and better graphics a major overhaul of dino ai and many other improvements over its predecessor

so what remains of all that in the end the game looks marginally better than the predecessor on the highest settings but is practically unplayable in terms of performance im playing the game on a relatively new pc with a rtx4080 and a 7800x3d in 4k fps ranges between 2050 with an average of about 30 on official servers 
but the dino ai must be much better now right 
no the dinos behave even more unrealistically than before and theres still no sign of herd behavior or any other signs of intelligence

despite the advertised improvements the game is worse than its predecessor has less content and only creates more opportunities for the developers to generate money

i was once a blinded fanboy of wildcard who blamed all faults on snail games but in the end the relationship between the two companies is not one of servitude

since 2015 wildcard has failed to meet a single deadline and has not fulfilled more than half of its promises

so is it worth spending money on this game at this point in time

a resounding no

the game is so full of bugs and crashes that its hardly worth tackling for anyone who isnt deeply passionate about the subject matter
its better to check back when the game has left early access and all the controversies around snail games have been resolved


edited the rtx mistake p
randy thats pretty much what i said
cam im playing the game since 2015 and its official branch shutdown was in 2023
mycoxincider ark has a lot of addicts p i know ppl that even doubled or trippled down my ase playtime
dropdeaddoe as a fan of a franchise and a company one often does things that are not rationally explainable however it is possible for anyone to alienate their hardcore fans as in this case you should definitely reconsider your way of communicating playtime correlates with the expenses of a game that does not operate on a subscription basis not with the income of the company

#####

1660 hours of game play between ase  asa ive never cheated in a game and dont play with cheaters no vac bans and have reported cheaters in the past playing in small tribes having built in an underwater spot under a pearl cave our tribe was global banned due to building in an unintended location without any warning or mild to moderate action against our tribe who were loyal fans and would have supported the game for years to come the devs decided to perma ban our legit non cheating tribe from all official servers this game is at its all time lowest player count and the devs without review  0 fucks given decide to permanently ban 5 previously loyal fans this game is buggy constant crashes messed up terrain that will delete all of your items when you land in the wrong spot on a mountain the bugs go on and on do your self a favor and buy a different game dont support a developer who treats its fan base like trash

#####

i love this game with everything in me honest to god its one of my favorite games of all time i have adhd and so it can be hard for me to stay interested in a game for a long period of time but not this one i can easily sink hundreds and hundreds of hours into this game and itll always be so much fun however theres a serious issue that needs to be addressed greed and laziness the developers are fairly lazy theres bugs in the game that have existed for many many years now the same bugs in the old game on the new one if they built it from the ground up again how could that be it seems to me like they got lazy and started copy and pasting code or something if youre not sure the remake is worth 40 rest assured it isnt unless you have a really powerful computer youre gonna have to end up playing on low settings anyways a remaster with the same bugs and issues years and years later how can you call that a remaster disgraceful we also have to talk about the greed while i still feel wildcard is greedy i dont think theyre actually that bad the real problem is their parent company snail games as well as their server provider nitrado snail games is incredibly greedy they please their shareholders by making pump and dump survival games that they always eventually abandon ark is their golden goose its the one they put the most care into upholding yet they still shit in everyones cereal constantly dont forget that this remaster was going to be free theres even been fiascos in the past where snail games employees get raided and they just ban the people who raided them off of the official server network however the greediest of them all is 100 without a doubt nitrado basically to sum it all up wildcard was in debt and needed servers nitrado offered to loan them servers but they wanted to exclusive rights for server hosting on ark survival ascended wildcard obliged and so now nitrado holds a complete monopoly over server hosting the cheapest server you can buy is 25 a month for 20 slots if you know anything about renting servers youll know thats pretty abhorrent thats incredibly expensive for servers that run like absolute dogshit anyways constant rubberbanding teleporting all of the place rollbacks insane amounts of lag so much so offical network is literally unplayable for me right now im supposed to live about 150 miles away from where the server is hosted yet i always get 150 ping on na servers its atrocious i know snail games will never change their greedy ways but i can at least hope the server hosting situation gets sorted because at this point i cant afford to host a server for just me and a few friends and even if i could it would suck anyways if you wanna buy it i totally get the appeal but do not support this kind of behavior wait till its on sale or the issues have been fixed i love ark it just deserves better management

#####

its ark

i genuinely dont understand their logic for making a whole new version on another engine when they still manage to drag all of the issues from the previous version over as well as some new ones horrendously optimized and it breaks at seeming random dino ai is still trash pathfinding is still trash these crashes on launch have been around for years and are the exact same ones survival evolved had and yet there is no concrete fix nor attempt to fix it in fact the attempts to fix this games issues almost always just bring more like when they tried to fix floating rocks and made more floating rocks and grasses and plants 

 theres a bug in the game by the way thats been there since release and kills all water tames when reloading the area since it loads them before the water not even a bandaid fix like giving water creatures a second or so before they drown out of water no acknowledgement despite the fact it effectively disables an entire way of playing the game in using and breeding water tames unless you want to play with their nerfed cryopodding everything always method that slows things down and means you cant have water defence dinos though maybe you wont want to ever experience ocean content anyway when going within 10 meters of the world border sometimes just zaps you and your tame and everything you had on you out of existance for no discernable reason and squids can still push you through the mesh or the world border deleting you and your things instantly theres still a random crash that happens sometimes in the sea that only seems to happen in the sea and hasnt been fixed since survival evolved 

cheating duping meshing is still rampant as ever community support is still nonexistant chinese megatribes blatantly abuse exploits and nothing is done but the second one of them doesnt like you or you speak up about it you will be met with retribution as the devs are in their pockets there is a ton of actual evidence to back this up if you are skeptical elsewhere

the pros to this version of ark are sadly very limited do you like gorgeous graphics well if you can get your computer to run it on max without bursting into flames youll enjoy the scenery the map meshes were redone its nice a number of quality of life features have been added but these quality of life changes were all available as mods before on survival evolved so if those are all you want dont bother the new building system is admittedly quite good

speaking of mods the devs have made the perplexing decision to have additional content like events and creature releases implemented as mods i cannot fathom why 

i want to end this by the way with saying i have several thousands of hours on survival evolved and even if i hated the concept of asa to begin with i would have been willing to pour another few thousand into asa if it felt like they werent just retreading the same ground in an even more cockeyed manner this whole game feels like a scam a cashgrab 

i miss when ark really felt like the devs cared about the quality it did genuinely feel that way once many years ago and its not because its in early access that it feels so bad now in asa i am certain  survival evolved was also in early access for a long time i was there for it and remember it and the deserved backlash for releasing scorched earth as paid dlc during early access in hindsight i should have taken that as an omen

that feeling of caring devs is unfortunately very much gone i cant in good conscience reccomend ark to anyone i have absolutely zero faith that any of the major crash sources bugs or glitches will be fixed anytime soon and even now theyre pulling their bullshit with paid extras for an unfinished product again

dear wildcard studio

as a gamer with nearly two decades of experience and thousands of hours spent playing ark survival evolved i was thrilled to have a new reason to immerse myself in a world filled with dinosaurs however after experiencing significant performance issues and frequent game crashes in your first game i was initially pleased to read your statement we did everything from scratch this led me to believe that you had learned from past mistakes and would deliver a game akin to ark survival evolved but with improved graphics consequently i purchased your new game and have dedicated over 430 hours to it since december now i feel prepared to offer my review

lets start with a conclusion and then ill explain my reasoning wildcard you have been a pain in the ass  firstly if you truly started from scratch why did you repeat the same bugs and glitches already fixed in ark survival evolved issues like dinosaurs getting stuck in structures or baby dinosaurs starving if not rendered are still prevalent to me this seems akin to a scam its like selling a brand new car that has already clocked 300000 km but the situation is even worse considering the state of your server application with merely 16 players connected we experience pings between 500700ms server crashes and unhelpful error logs it baffles me how a backend programmer could fail to write informative crash logs how can problems be fixed without logs detailing the issues

jeremy motherfucking stieglitz himself said the servers are ass they run like ass and their stability is assits clear that the problem lies with your server application not the servers themselves we use a root server with ample ram and a capable cpu yet we face the same issues as every nitrado server this reminds me of a situation a decade ago when faced with highend pcs barely reaching 30fps your response was well buy a better computer it seems easier for you to blame others for problems stemming from subpar game development your development team appears to be at such a basic level that they could easily be replaced by students and not necessarily those studying programming anyone with basic google skills could potentially do a better job

thus i feel like i paid 50 to work as an alpha tester for a game that was ostensibly released six years ago to be absolutely clear your approach is deeply disappointing in an industry often accused of neglecting its customers in pursuit of profit you have managed to stand out as one of the worst offenders

#####

i really like that they kept the nostalgia of every single bug from ark survival evolved takes me back like way back all the way to how the game was in 2015 3 how kind

 dung beetles still fall through foundations into the rocky abyss

 the alpha and large dinos will still phase through and become one with your dinosaur trapping them mauling them to death while all you can do is whistle desperately and cry as they die in front of you

 official servers still crash and roll back every 15 minutes after playing for 15 minutes so you get to play even more 

 official servers also still stutter and lag like im stuck in 2015

 dino follow ai still makes me want to scream violently 

 fatal error x 100

 nothing is decaying fully on official so theres thatch and abandoned bases everywhere that noone can do anything about

 volumetric clouds and fog cannot be turned off in settings so you have to use  

 optimisation no

 the new dino tracking system is just so bugged i cant get rid of tracked people and the icons fly around the map constantly or theres double icons

 as i was writing this my ptera on follow just clipped through someones base i sat on to gain stamina safely and is now one with their base trapped ripped from my arms and into the base of a random 


and im sure theres many more i can find if i just play the game for 10 minutes more

this unreal engine update was supposed to be a free upgrade to those who purchased ark then they went back on their word and said they wanted it to be sold for 90 bundled with ark 2 then changed their minds again and are selling it for the current price minus ark 2 were on track for all expansions to be also paid content yippee

for a studio thats made well into the millions and still wont fix problems ive been experiencing since 2015 thats a no from me chief dont buy this glad i got this as a gift part of the reason i enjoy this game is because it has the potential to be an amazing game to play if they just you know fixed 6 year old bugs idk


edit 

people can still force crash servers using rocket launchers to roll it back 

if you go into the alpha dragon fight its invisible and youre stuck there waiting for the timer to count down and everything to die

 people who are not in your tribe or alliance can still sneak into the boss fights with you raising the difficulty multiplier and waiting for the boss rewards to spawn to steal them 

#####

i wanted to believe that the game was going to be better in every way but its not so lets start this off with a very short the good and the bad

the good 
1 the graphics are just amazing as you would expect from ue 5
2 no irrigation pipes no mess no fuss
3 no electrical cables same honestly as no water pipes but still deserves its own mention 
4 baby dinos are a nice touch you can claim them check the stats and keep them or delete them all while skipping the whole egg hatching phase saving a great deal of time tame the parent dino claim the baby 2 for 1 
5 boss runs can be started from the comfort of your own base via transmitter 

i tried to think of more for the good portion of this post but its just not there so onward

the bad
1 servers are cross play what does this mean for you as a pc player it means that thanks to the limitations of gaming consoles the servers have had the settings turned way down so that the console community could even run the game 
render distance for structures is still fairly decent but you will not see any dinos on the map until you are with in 50 m of said dino 
2  a build structure limitation of just 5500 structures has been added this is a good thing and a bad thing honestly it prevents massive mega structures but at the same time  you basically have to build a box just to have a base with the room to raise more than 4 or 5 dinos at a time the use or decorative structuring or fancy roof designs are pointless as you use to many triangles railings and pillars resulting in a fairly small base hitting structure cap very quickly 
it would not be so bad if you could toggle the build zone so we can see where the game has decided that the middle of our base is but as of now you can not see that indicator 13 of my base can not have any more structures placed at all while other sections are still fine to build in
3 cryopods have been nerfed so you can no longer pod and unpod a tame where ever you like you must be in range of a powered cryo fridge that you have ownership over this just created the need for people to spam generators and fridges at key points on the map all that because they are to lazy to make the needed balance changes to pvp servers on their own 
4 the servers are very unstable at times the server will crash every few minutes pair that with high latency and random player kicks and you end up with a near unplayable game
5 almost all of the new fancy graphics additions have to be disabled or you get the same two crashes over and over low lvl fatal error and purple rain both crashes seem to mostly target players with nvidia 400 series gpus so paying the big bucks on your rig just for ark to turn it in to a paper weight
6 poor planing on the dev teams part rather than focusing on the problems plaguing the first maps launch and bad design change choices they are pushing out more content and opening transfers so same old ark politics fix nothing sell more spread out the player base over multiple under populated servers to hide the servers performance issues then open micro transactions bringing ark out of the shadows to join the rest of the pay to win titles out there i could go on but this has already taken up more of my time than this dev team is worth save your money wait and if you are lucky just maybe some day asa will be at least playable my bets are on this cash grab scam failing ark 2s funding dries up due to the failed launch of asa and snail games dries up leaving wild card to think good and hard about their piss poor partner choices  

on the short note just avoid this game for now the price will come down as the dust settles but it will never be worth the current 50 price tag if i could refund it i would but i wanted to give the remaster a fair chance my target was 500 hours before posting this review but not being able to finish our base build was the last straw for me i got close enough and now i am done


updated review 
while every thing i said above was very true at the time of writing that review i wanted to take the time to come back and update my review as my opinion of the game has changed due to a few changes that have taken place in the ark universe 

1 many of the crashing issues have been resolved at least for pc players i have put in another 750 hours of game play since my original review and while there are still bugs and little annoying things that have existed in ark for many many years now there is also a lot of good things happening 

2 the launch of scorched earth showed us that they can release a map and not make the game worse at the same time stability of the servers has been very solid as of recently 

3 communication is improving between players wild card and snail games knowing what is going on and being up front and honest about their mistakes has been a notable change in behavior from what we have become accustom to while it would be even better if they would just set realistic release goals for themselves in the first place it has still been much better than having delay after delay after delay with little to no word from either of the two 

4 while i hate the fact that pay 2 win aspects have found their way in to the ark universe through the means of purchasing additional add on content  its not all bad new cosmetic kits new customization options and so many other ways to tailor ark to your own personal liking though i will admit i have lost a fair bit of thatch and fiber at the gambling table with tribe mates and allies 

5 new dinos to tame with the addition of new dinos to tame new challenges to over come areas to explore and lore to collect ark has a lot to offer now for old time players who might be interested in returning and even more to offer for new players experiencing ark for the first time

so in short if you have the extra cash   i still hate that we have to buy everything again but it is a necessary evil if we want to see ark survive since they still cant manage their funds for cht 
buy the game but the dlc if you want the full remastered and ever changing ark experience it may not be for every one but for many of you who might be interested it can be a very fun game 

#####

its a shame but its in a pretty awful state currently
note i am going to try and come back to this review as i play more and update it with the things i dodont like
its probably going to be pretty messy but i hope it helps some of you

edit 1 okay so as it turns out this game is actually even more unplayable than i thought in 3 hours i have crashed about 7 times ive updated my graphics drivers and i like to think i keep my pc in overall good health so i can only think it is to do with the game rather than my pc this game seems incredibly unstable playing alone and spamming saves whenever i remember seems to be the only way i can get anything done  because otherwise i will crash and lose all progress from when i last saved

edit 11 okay so i havent been crashing nearly as much anymore i wish i knew what it was that stopped the crashes but day 1 i was just getting loads and after a couple days it has improved significantly performance is still pretty shitty and there are some performance bugs that are quite significant

edit 2 so after they released that optimisation patch it has helped but still has a long way to go i put together a spreadsheet of how much each setting impacts the overall performance

the most fun i have had in ark survival ascended so far was in the character creator seeing how truly horrendous i could make my character look the quality of the character is pretty damn good  although there are quite a few less options for some things now

the game looks phenomenal absolutely stunning its got to be one of the best looking games i have seen in terms of general landscape and lighting that is if you can run it but well get to that

the foliage and just all the details in general look really good global illumination does a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of how good the game looks which is a shame because it seems to be the most demanding setting

i havent had the chance to check them all out but the new buildings look pretty incredible i love the changes theyve made to the style the buildings are in and it does a lot to make things look innately pretty rather than the less than appetising structures in ase 

especially happy with the change to the wall height  making them square rather than the weird rectangles they used to be

the main menu redesign looks great and works so much better more settings are exposed for hosting a server locallysingleplayer which makes it so so much easier to set up the rates and settings you want without having to outside of the game edit a ini file

although there arent many yet having mods built directly into the main menu and allowing them to be cross platform is great and really improves how easy it is to installmanage mods without messing around with the steam workshops awful ui

h1consh1
okay the elephant in the room  this game runs truly awfully i was worried it was going to be the case but hoping that all the incredible tech in ue5 such as nanite would pull things together and make it run alright but the minimumrecommended specs are a bit of a joke  and the fact it runs awfully even on a top end system from a year or so ago is beyond crazy ill leave some numbers below for those interested based on my pc

the in game ui looks good overall  but some aspects are a bit harder to read and it overall feels a little slowerclunkier opening the inventory seems to take more time and that really adds up to be very irritating

some settings really just seem to hog most of the performance i can get the game in a pretty good looking state but it will run at 35fps if i change general shadows from high to medium i immediately start getting 60fps this is a shame because having shadows on anything lower than high makes them look awful medium shadows just creates a very visible cut off radius around your character where no shadows are rendered so everything in the distance just looks totally incorrect but its the difference between 30 and 60fps 

strikethere doesnt seem to be a way to raise the difficultymax level past 150 currently maybe you can edit an ini file but there is no setting that you can change in the menus when setting up a worldstrike
you can increase the difficulty by going to
cprogram files x86steamsteamappscommonark survival ascendedshootergamesavedconfigwindows
opening gameusersettingsini and underneath serversettings add overrideofficialdifficulty5
the number can be anything multiply it by 30 to get your max level so 5  30  150 if you want max level of 180 use 6
i also cant find a setting to increase the number of dino spawns i really havent ran into many dinos

h1misch1
the new building parts are great and a lot of improvements have been made to the building system however i do still think that there are just some incredibly obvious pieces missing why are quarter floors added when theres no quarter foundation or even a half foundation 
you are able to place 2 quarter floors in the same square that a foundation would fit in  so surely adding in a quarter foundation which can do the same cant be that hard right it really limits the usability of them imo because it doesnt connect nicely to anything

same with quarter size wall slopes 

maybe im the crazy one  but it seems that if you are going to add a building item such as a quarter size structure it makes sense to add the entire set of items so that any one of them actually has something to connect to in a way that makes sense and fills gaps left otherwise


overall  i really wouldnt recommend the game in its current state unless you have an absolutely insane pc built within the last 12 months

some rough numbers

strikefor reference  i have a ryzen 7 5800x rtx 3080ti and 32gb of ram the game is installed on an m2 ssd i run the game at 1440p
the following numbers in no way are a proper benchmark they are just rough averages for where i happened to be in game at the time i was testing this  but it should give you an idea of what to expect if you run a similar system to me
epic settings  no dlss  1440p  15fps
epic settings  performance dlss  1440p  2530fps
medium settings  performance dlss  1440p  4045fps
low settings  performance dlss  1440p  6075fps
low settings  performance dlss  1080p  7075fpsstrike
btheyve since released an optimisation patch that invalidates these numbers check the spreadsheet mentioned above instead for more detailed numbersb

i know the game looks phenomenal but i really do think there is more to be done to make this game run better than it does most of the reason for the remake was the increase in graphical quality  and when most of your players preexisting or not are not going to be able to use most of the graphical upgrades its a total waste and defeats the point

#####

i want to see the nasa pc that this game was tested on before releasing to the public


edit thanks for all the gifts everyone being that this got so much traction i wanted to edit my review although at first the game was literally unplayable after defeating the login boss and a couple updates later ark is back online the game has incredibly captivating graphics with a greatly improved depth of view in regards to brightness saturation and detail countless improvements that i could list but im not getting paid for this needless to say im back on the ark grind see you online 

i would change to recommended but you have to be a die hard ark fan to put up with the bugs

#####

my country economy runs more stable

#####

this game makes you have no life 633 hours sunk in some weeks i have 60 hours of ark logged and that is low compared to some tribes i mostly played smalltribes pvp and it was active and fun at the beginning so many client crashes  low server stability that eventually got better the main issue is the player base we had to compete against against tribes that had an advantages we didnt have speed hacking ghost mode auto flak equip auto aim and various account sharing tribes it eventually becomes to much it wears you down we eventually retreated and rebuilt in an underwater rat hole that requires you to have a vacuum chamber to crouch and get in its below a pearl cave most know the spot well we were winding down due to inactivity and low pop its almost been 4 months and still no server transfers enabled and probably will be 6 months till a map comes out well we discovered today that we were dev wiped and all global banned from all official servers for violating code of conduct specifically unintended build location well that was the final nail in the coffin in a totally legit non cheating tribe its a gray area and we had no idea as its a fairly popular youtube base location
i actually feel relief that i can have a life thank you wildcard  fuck you

#####

pathetic how they care more about some events instead of making the servers laggdelay free
after waiting  5 months to fix this i gave up on waiting and uninstalled
big thumbs down

#####

well after almost 130 hours played i think i can tell my opinion about this game 
so dont get me wrong i absolutely love it i love ark and i wouldnt have bought it again if i didnt but i just cant recommend it in its current state its just bad from the optimization which is absolutely garbage trust me this has to be the most unoptimized game in the history of unoptimized games even with a decent pc you still barely hit 6070 fps and if you are in a place with a lot of vegetation or a lot of creatures around you attacking and stuff like that the game drops to 3040 fps or in the most extreme cases you have a fps drop to 1520 fps to all the bugs that it has old same bugs from the original game and new ones and constant crashes which i dont understand how it is not an urgent matter for the devs to fix you trying to do a cave killing tons of creatures attacking you crash you try to fly across the map on your dino crash you literally just stay in one place breathing crash its mostly random sometimes you can go hours or not at all without a crash or you can crash 5 times in a row trying to do something i once had the game paused watching a video on yt and my game just crashed your dinos ascend to heaven or they mesh through the ground many times i found my creatures falling through the ground in my base or after i died in a cave and went back i found them outside the map in the void the game auto save option doesnt work in single player so combine that with the random crashes if you forget to manual save from time to time and your game crashes you lose your progress for whatever amount of time since you last saved at the moment of writing this the ascension seems bugged too you dont get your betaalpha implant or the achievements for defeating the boss on betaalpha difficulty

#####

i have been a faithful player of ark evolved and now ascended ive logged over 18k hours on evolved alone ive always loved the concept of the game and its always kept me coming back for more however i just cant recommend this game to anyone because of the developer team at wildcard studios ive never seen a studio so out of touch with their player base and just so blatantly disorganized and have absolutely no foresight at all it has just become to frustrating that my tribe and i have finally given up 

weve sat through hundreds of bugs delays unplayable servers but after this launch its just been too much we were ready day 1 and waited around all day refreshing on pc to be one of the first in and try to get a good location we were lucky enough to get one of the best spots herb island on a official server pve wouldnt you know it some how the dev team enabled god mode so anyone could spawn whatever they wanted in after about 2 hours after launch they did a complete rollback to day 0 and all was lost for us by the time servers were back online we had to log off and never had a chance at getting the island again immediately all of the servers were capped 7070 they didnt make nearly enough servers for the amount of users attempting to play it was an insane lack of planning that really makes you wonder how a decision like that could possibly be made almost immediately the servers began crashing hourly generally speaking the first few weeks of any map launch had smooth running servers it was only after people were established and tribes built mega bases did server performance start to suffer that wasnt the case here as the servers began crashing hourly with a 15 minute roll back over and over daily still we suffered through it playing the game 3040 minutes at a time and tried our best to plan around the inevitable crash and roll back just hoping eventually wildcard would find a solution this went on for weeks with no real resolution 

they then made matters even worse when they decided to implement a join server queue system that wasnt really a server queue system but simply an auto clicker that was much slower than any actual auto clicker this made all of their capped servers which they all were way harder to get into their logic was laughable they wanted to save us on clicks all they did was make us have to click more to get around a prompt that made the game even harder to access the discord was flooded with users pleading to have it removed and of course nothing was done about it it seems eventually the system works better than previously although im not sure if thats a case of less players actually trying to get into the servers 

the next huge error imo was when xbox and ps5 launched weeks after release our server steam was advancing well there were hardly any places to build this is official pve pillar hell mind you we were constantly at server population cap when xbox released and ps5 shortly after our old server was flooded with these players looking to start fresh on a already overbuilt map with players at a much different stage of progression overnight our capped server just become completely unplayable the console players just kept joining even though there were boosted new servers for them to play on they kept saying that these servers were impossible to get into so they had to come to the older servers just to get started it created a huge mess all of the older servers were overrun in days and we all hit server tame cap we couldnt do anything during the much anticipated afterlife event turkey trails has now started and we cant tame breed or do anything of worthy progression in the game other than farm materials 

the game now in its current form is completely useless we should talk about why wildcard would launch a game like this how anyone there that it would be a good idea to not include cryopods that help so much with server stability now all of us who were first in are paying the price of these laughable decisions 
ive been playing since release back in 2015 but i am done at this point

 we can talk about the issues above and sure that played a big role in my decision and my tribemates and tons of other former players ive talked to however the biggest reason im calling it quits is because of the dev team specifically dollie and cedric cedric is suppose to be the community manager and its just an absolute joke hes rarely active on social media or the discord never getting ahead of any issue never advocating for the community or keeping us up to date go check his x right now and see the laughable amount of information he puts out this game is an abject failure as a community manager and the fact that he can operate in his role without actually doing his job tells you all you need to know about the managing team behind him 

that brings me to dollie who loves to masquerade as a community manager when its convenient for her the lack of communication from cedric pushes dollie to the front of the communication line mainly on discord where she is generally the one answering questions the issue she uses it as her personal venting platform where she cares more about her witty 1 liners and shaming the few trolls who say inappropriate comments she scrolls by hundreds of legitimate issues recommendations and even messages of support and targets in on the few 12 year old trolls who are making inappropriate comments its so disingenuous that she does this so she is constantly viewed as the victim not the thousands of paying customers who are begging to be heard by anyone at the company about all of their valid complaints this is a view shared by every single player ive spoken to about it in game 

dont be like me dont invent your time and energy into this game the dev team does not care about you and have no foresight at all this game will pull you in and then frustrate you to all hell take my advice and avoid it 


#####

its a beautiful game but its a reskin of the old game the mods are better on ase and since nitrado doesnt really want you to run your own servers they added additional option to find player servers to force them out of que and only show nitrados and if you do run your own server they will add a game server query and a live link to your ini files without your consent on top of a trace utility being added as well under the radar just kinda gives me bad vibes and shady practices

#####

this game is dependent on epic online services eos for any multiplayer functionality 
eos is blocked here
that requirement should be mentioned in the system requirements on the shop page

i love ark i have nearly 3000 hours in arkse
arksa runs fine for me the game looks good and the quality of life additions are really nice
there is no doubt that i will put a lot of hours in arksa too however there is one big problem nitrado

nitrado is a very incompetent company that gained the monopoly over official and unofficial server hosting
their server performance is terrible and their customer service is awful
ark is build by communities and nitrado is ruining it for all those communities

as long as nitrado is in charge i will not recommend this game

edit response by nitrado when confronted that their servers arent working very professional

#####

avoid at all costs  the devs wildcard and publisher snail do not deserve your support or money 

i bought this game due to the roadmap the roadmap which turned out to be completely fictional constant delays swapping of maps due to be released terrible communication of planned server shutdowns and overall terrible execution of bug fixes at every turn 

even as someone who loves the concept and spent a lot of time in survival evolved i would tell my pastself to not bother giving these crooks money they focus on paid mods and paytowin concepts more than actually releasing maps that they promised 

do not buy

#####

even getting this game for free because somebody bought it for me this is such a disappointment allow me to list my frustrations with this game and the company who made it

first and foremost this game was announced as being free for anybody who bought the first ark then that promise was taken back we complained and then the price was increased what absolute insanity is that

second i am an it technician as my job my job experience shouldnt be a requirement to get double digit frame rates what is the point of a ue5 release that runs worse than the ue4 i shouldnt have to put console commands in to disable things like the volumetric clouds or water reflections those can be gui options as opposed to being softlocked into a powerpoint presentation unless the average person looks up these optimizations

third speaking of optimization i think studio wildcard needs to go work for blizzard and activision this is roughly an 80 gigabyte game and that by itself is no big deal can anybody explain to me why two days in a row ive had to patch the game with an 80 gigabyte patch are they developing each patch from scratch are they trying to create a new game from the ground up every time they find something to fix 

oh hey john i found a small math error in the spawn algorithm hapless employee
start development over then do your job better john presumably the manager

forth minor points here but some of these really really bother me everything in the game has shifted in the color scheme it used to be a fantasy wilderness that wasnt too special it sort of hit the feeling of i have no complaints or praise this is functional now everything is tinted with a press  to defecate color also there was a decent balance of wilderness and video game in the ue4 version of ark what do i mean by this one word vegetation

forthpointfive vegetation plants shrubs every single patch of grass can be looted for fiber now i know what youre thinking bob how is more lootables bad isnt that more materials to use yes youre partially correct it is more materials to use but this press e to gather plant fiber crap that is everywhere even on top of the resource caves underwater it just makes herbivores or fiber gathering animals a pain in the ass this problem is minor i know but ark already had a problem with fiber and it being one of the most abundant things and now its actual a problem

fifth deva vu im willing to go back and update this review if i end up being wrong but im calling it all the dlcs will be rereleased and wildcard will most likely expect us to pay for them again i take back my earlier statement though wildcard should apply at bethesda they make barely functional games which end up being good rpgs and the constant rereleasing of old content and making people pay for it again

do not buy this scam

#####

for context i play ark mostly solo always pve the concept of homesteading in a dinobased survival world is why ark appealed to me and i always wished the game would be more accessible to a casual solo player i hope this review can help people with a similar play style decide if they should buy it 

the game is essentially a remaster the main change is the graphics the game is stunningly pretty even on lower settings wildcard also say they made improvements under the hood for optimisation i think this is what comes with changing over to ue5 because it still needs a strong gpu and careful tweaks to run well the graphical changes do really help with the immersion which is a big appeal for someone like me playing for a relaxing dino taming time rather than pvp i can imagine the performance is pretty frustrating for pvp players 

in ark evolved my biggest frustrations were feeling locked out of content the janky and unappealing ui and some of the odd mechanics does ascended fix these things yes and no 

there is more respect for your time now the difficulties are easier to set up for single player and the overall sp mode feels more balanced the building mechanics really help with this too with changes such as being able to pick up anything youve placed indefinitely and just general qol with building that actually means i can try things out without feeling ive wasted a lot of time for nothing i feel like breeding projects are more accessible as the changes to mutations make it less time consuming to make pretty and powerful tames

the ui looks a bit sleeker now and less like a placeholder although there are still frustrating things like not being able to see all craftable items in the smithy for example the ui still feels janky to me i was hoping that some design improvements would happen to make it a little more intuitive theyve made some mechanics work more intuitively though radius effects for water and energy is a big change that makes building a bit more accessible in some regards all the extra paints are really nice for the creatively minded player too  

but there are still loads of bugs i crash lots sometimes other times not ive died randomly and not had a death marker or my stuff drop its just gone the game has some odd issues with spawns and there are years old bugs that have made their way over from evolved there hasnt been much acknowledgement of these problems either 

the game also feels a bit empty at the moment because the dlc stuff isnt included yet so its a very barebones ark experience its nice to start a little slow and know theres more to come but its worth mentioning as it could be a deal breaker for some 

i still recommend this game but only because dinosaurs it fills a special void in my brain and i have such a love hate relationship with the game but theres nothing else like it out there ascendeds changes have meant for me the game is a little closer to the chill dinosaur homesteading game i craved at the time of ase i will put lots of hours into it i am sure but make no mistake this game is flawed 



#####

positives its ark

negatives its ark

#####

arkcrash evolved

#####

they refuse to fix the singleplayer no resource respawn bug

#####

found a family of dodos killed its parents and took the kid for myself named him batman


#####

as a hardcore ark fan i would definitely not recommend this game for the following reasons 

1 wildcard has proven during the course of this launch that they have no respect for open communication to their fans they had a developer send a pretty crappy response when people were trying to figure out dates they did not deliver even 50 of what they said they would 

2 they have completely ruined the modding community for this title be requiring the use of curseforge as a mod platform curseforge clearly can dictate what you can and cannot post as a mod and since its the only way to publish mods for this game it will fail hard 

3 there is nothing in this game that makes it any better than ark survival evolved higher resolution textures

4 wildcard has made an exclusivity arrangement with nitrado that will restrict your ability to setup a server with another company which has monopolized this service nitrado has promptly taken advantage of this by raising their price triple the normal price unnecessarily

i am completely disappointed by wildcards approach to this release and how they have treated their community i am going to be requesting a refund of the game

#####

stephen hawking runs better than this game

#####

getting 3045 fps with an rtx 4090 and i9 13900k at 1440p

#####

is this game worth recommending to other players in its current state

no

its so extremely buggy at times unplayable the lag is fucking crazy you cannot run this game on anything above the lowest settings otherwise your pc will fry
you need to use the console to lower your settings further turning off shadowsclouds ect just to get 60 fps but dont worry youll crash multiple times in an hour anyway due to fatal errors 

im honestly in disbelief the state this game was launched in and the updates barely help

im posting this review shortly after the announcement theyve made about scorched not coming out until march even though it was promised on launch aswell as letting us know that there are these new dlcs for our dlcs that you have to pay extra for to get skins engrams and the new dinos that come with the dlc maps that were originally free 
im not sure how many times studio wildcard is going to go back on their word or delay releases but surely its a record at this point 

they somehow managed to sell us the same game that runs shitter and squeeze more money out of us for the only new content new dinos and push it back to up to 2 years release

at this stage dont buy the game its not worth it right now just wait until there are enough updatesfixes and hopefully enough of our voices to stop this dlc paytowin ontop of dlc ontop of remake is aborted

granted if asa somehow changes my mind and i think its worth recommending ill gladly update this review

#####

barely works crashes every 10 seconds and runs at 10fps ark is back baby

#####

big shock unoptimized mess

#####

my computer is on life support because of a dinosaur game

#####

absolutely disgusting awful trash i will play 2k hours of this

#####

imagine charging people for a graphics refresh and not even dealing with the bugs and crashes from the original game lmao was the dev teaming smoking crack when they did this

save yourself the money dont buy this garbage

the shooter bug still exists so if you like to die while losing all your best stuff to a bug that the developer doesnt want to fix then this is your game

#####

i had high hopes for this game devs said they would be fixing bugs and glitchs and there are far more bugs and glitchs then the old game they even left many console commands in the game like rnaniteviewmeshlodbiasoffset 1000
rnaniteviewmeshlodbiasoffset 1 you can see right through bases on pvp servers no point in playing this game if enemys can just turn off trees and bushes and walls and see where every turret is in your base think its time to salt the snail and stop giving these greedy devs money for there broken games dont get me started on how the game runs also still seems to be using the same slow  servers with over 100 ping like the last game

#####

do not buy this game not in this state not for 40 period 

negating all the unacceptable things snail and wildcard have done coming from an official ase player with 47k hours this game is genuinely unplayable and unacceptable theyre gradually making imrpovements though it is not enough this company makes too much money to feel like its okay to release a game in early access like this early access is an excuse to get away with throwing out an unfunctioning product for 40

it is entirely unoptimized i never thought id say this but it makes ase look stable in comparison unless you genuinely have a 5k pc you will not be getting 60fps without sacrificing a huge chunk of quality 
for the love of god do not play official pve or pvp you will be given constant and i mean constant rollbacks and crashes 7 times in one day was my progress spontaneously set back 1520 minutes while also resetting spawns so if youd just finished taming something youd lose it if you just finished building something its undone collecting something those materials are gone a lot can happen in that time and its infuriating for it to happen that many times a day
the servers go down frequently some for 5 hours at a time before theyre fixed and theres nothing more stressful than a server crashing while youre gone from your base and waiting hours for it to come back up afraid that youll be dead when you can get back in
no offline protection from npc dinos on pve anymore you dont have to fear players but especially without cryos even pve players can log in with all their dinos dead


the two credits i can give to this game is that yes it is beautiful environment wise the dinos are literally the same as ase with slightly more detailed scales and there is some qol from ase such as better building pinging having wild dino babies roam is a huge plus but ultimately this game is quite literally the overwatch 2 of overwatch some qol thats not even close to being worth the things that make it worse than the original and the pros could be done in a patch and do not justify a new game though in this case the new game isnt free its 40 and unfinished genuinely genuinely unfinished 

again negating snail and wildcards unforgivable decisions i want to love ark i loved ase so take it from a person that genuinely loved ase i want to like asa even after losing 47k hours of official playtime i want to enjoy this and feel like this is ase but better but its ase and worse so much worse and nigh unplayable if you really have to play wait do not buy it in this state of my 19 hours on record i am not exaggerating when i say roughly 3 was actual playtime the rest was fighting to get in servers to get rolled back or crash and wait for them to reopen

#####

ark survival evolved but on roids in my opinion a huge upgrade from ase
i myself am more of a pve player and the open world on the rework of the island is absolutely stunning

in game commands to increase fps cap keep in mind some these commands will make the game look a little weird

 rstreamingpoolsize 0
unlockes all memory on your gpu

 rshadowquality 0
disables all shadows

rvolumetriccloud 0
disables the volumetric sky

 rnanitemaxpixelsperedge 4
reduces triangles for meshes

 rlumenscreenprobegatherradiancecacheproberesolution 16
optimizes lumen

 rdynamicglobalilluminationmethod 2
disables lumen





tips to increase fps cap
have all the graphic settings at low except for view distance and post processing
you want view distance to be set as medium as well as post processing
dont move resolution scale below 82 so you can actually see

for clarification this is just ase but with better graphics and a few more mechanics youll still get ptsd from it

#####

after being promised a free update to ue5 it turns out instead its paying for the same content we already bought in a new engine dont get me wrong there indeed other changes as well ui changes building changes etc

however the performance is terrible unless youre willing to turn off a bunch of features

also for an official pvp player this is what the first day has looked like so far

servers came up at 6am eu time after 3 hours the entire network was taken down and rolled as they had literally left the admin menu on by default

after the servers came back on at 9am we got maybe 3 hours on and now its been down for 4 and half hours

wildcard hit the jackpot with the concept of the game they well and truly did but their own arrogance lies to the community and half baked approach has been consistent since arkse went into early access it persists to this day 

i want to play a dinosaur open world survival game the concept is awesome but with wildcard running its a constant horror show of lack of diligence in development and an absolute arrogance towards its userbase

i would avoid this game like the plague maybe in 6 months of more development time it might be half decent but as it stands right now  its not worth the money no where near it just go play arkse instead and at this point maybe the only way to stop these developers from showing the outright contempt they do for their user base 



#####

have a decent computer than can run all top graphic games on high settings games like cyberpunk red dead redemption 2 and more literally cannot run the game without multiple crashes stutters and fps issues on the lowest graphical settings we shouldnt be allowing game studios to release games to the public like this especially not a remaster who puts out a remaster that doesnt run correctly isnt that the point of a remaster for it to run better and look better awful product

#####

feels like 2015 all over again singledigit frame rates and bodies disappearing into the ground geometry i am giddy with nostalgia who needs shiny new maps or a sequel 

not me i will be here playing ark powerpoint ascended thanks for the memories and the slideshow wildcard

30 hours later

this title is in early access anyone purchasing an ea title should expect performance issues and significant changes to the game over time i am recommending it based on that understanding 

i spun up a dedicated vanilla server and started running the island last week due to other needs i picked up a geforce 4090 last friday so i have had a chance to evaluate throughout the release patches different playing environments and different gpus

i can max everything and enable ray tracing at 5k playing on a 49 329 monitor with the 4090 and stay at 60 fps without any dips with the 3070 ti it spans between 2040 fps on medium settings 

the game has optimization issues which was the point of my original short review the night it was released ark survival evolved had exactly the same shortcomings when it was released in early access in 2015 which while ironic is also why i am still recommending the game 

bugs will get squashed and performance issues will be resolved it might take a while but even in low settings the game is still gorgeous and the subtle changes to gameplay and the map are encouraging i am looking forward to seeing the release of the rest of the official maps

#####

for now its only a graphic and sound update to arkse
yes there are new very nice mechanics like no movement speed stat or new building but selling these few new things for 50 usd is ridiculous to me
the game is very buggy
flying textures game crashing when wanting to respawn same problems that arkse had
im aware its an early access but selling a game that is pretty much the same as the first version just with more bugs for 50 usd is laughable
i really hope they make it into a great game that is worth the money but for now id rather play se then the broken remastered version of it

#####

if you have the hardware to run it this is an upgrade over the original game visually the graphics are astounding and it increases the immersion in a big way 
theres a few exceptions to this the new volumetric clouds which present a lot of artifacts and have an unacceptable performance hit they can be disabled with the console command rvolumetriccloud 0 without the quotes the devs have specifically mentioned they will be improving the performance of these clouds with future updates which i look forward to
another graphics nitpick i have is the shadows they are too sharp and do not soften as they get further from their origin which looks very strange alongside the global illumination
artificial light sources need a touchup wall torches and lamps light up objects very close to them way too much resulting in blown out lighting the falloff doesnt look good either theres too little of a gradient and the light doesnt reach as far as it should
sometimes small amounts of light leak through things they shouldnt like stone and wood ceilings and roofs

its unclear if wildcard added dlss 35 ray reconstruction if they havent i humbly ask that they do

unfortunately its not stable right now  crashes more than any game i have ever played this will improve with updates i am choosing to be patient with it considering how much fun i am having

dino ai has been significantly improved

the addition of wild baby and juvenile dinos is amazing increases immersion and gives you choices as far as taming goes

it doesnt run particularly well  even with a ryzen 9 5900x and rtx 4090 on maximum settings 4k dlss performance and frame gen on i sometimes struggle to maintain 60 fps out in the wild although it doesnt go into the low 50s or the 40s ever
if you dont have a 4k monitor like me youll find that it runs much better resolution is by far the biggest impact on performance for rtx 4090 owners that have a 1440p gsync monitor you are going to have a great experience

performance inside large bases has been overhauled with a new instanced rendering technique  i get up to 120 fps in my house which is nice basically  rendering 100 identical build pieces only has the cpu workload as rendering one of them annihilating the extremely annoying bottleneck most survival games have in bases

some things have been removed from the game like cryopods although there is already a mod that adds them back the map is not exactly the same as the island from the original game which to some will be a slight disappointment to others an exciting opportunity to explore the changes none of the changes are extreme though much of what wasnt broken hasnt been fixed which my friend and i appreciated but please know this is not just a simple remaster of the original

another thing worth mentioning for people running servers the ability to pick up wild dinos with argents and whatnot would not work with the default server settings i fixed this by going into arksashootergamesavedconfigwindowsservergameusersettingsini and added allowflyercarrypvetrue
the command for that was in the original games server config file but i actually had to add it into the file i did it on a whim as a last resort and it worked hope that helps

the new ui is much better especially the map double tap m for the really good map you can zoom pan and place waypoints

the new tracking system is really nice for keeping track of tribemates and tames

for players that are looking to play official pvp or pve servers theres just not enough of them right now its very difficult to get into a server and the amount of crashes makes it difficult to stay in one once you have gotten in the crashes also break pvp gameplay as players will crash in the middle of raids

also the favorites tab in the server menu is completely broken i have to search for my server every time i go to play

in spite of the early problems overall i am happy with my purchase as i do know that updates will improve it a lot and they will be adding more servers although i already have my own dedicated one i am playing with friends

improved clouds and performance tutorial below

this is a set of unreal engine 5 commands you can enter in the games console that will fix the artifacts in the clouds and improve performance at little cost to visuals keep in mind these are the settings i am using on my setup and your results may vary i am playing in 4k dlss performance with an rtx 4090 
also the volumetric settings will do nothing unless you have not turned off the volumetric clouds

to enter the console press the tilde key    in game then put these commands into it one by one pressing enter between each command

rstreamingpoolsize 0
the above command allows the streaming pool size to be as big as it wants to be will use more vram but perform better

rnanitemaxpixelsperedge 2
the above command lowers the nanite resolution decreasing mesh density on objects far from the camera this greatly improves performance the default is 1 i like to use 2 as i see no difference and get more frames if you dont mind faraway trees looking crappy you can go up to 4

rvolumetriccloudviewraysamplemaxcount 128
the above command sets the resolution of the volumetric clouds the higher you go less grain and flickering will be there at the cost of performance i tried 64 but the grain was still there in 4k  although i think on 1080p you could use 64

rvolumetricrendertargetmode 3
the above command changes the mode the volumetric clouds are rendered at youll notice after entering the last command the clouds actually look worse but this setting actually kicks the fix into effect feast your eyes no more distracting artifacts and flickering

hope this all helps happy arking

#####

i ate a berry and my game crashed 

#####

if you know ark survival evolved nothing changed 

ok there are some nice quality of life changes but everything else in general is the same or even worse now you might think my friend oh this is only an early access game i should be patient then i would say for the love of god they had 8 years to learn and improve having bugs like the ones in asa are unacceptable from a developer that ran basically the same game for almost 10 years
 flyers fly through walls hello meshers
 baby dinos fall through mesh
 your tames get stuck in mesh antimesh only works when its in the mood
 constant crashesrollbacks
 tamed dinos get teleported back to the taming spot
 you get teleported at certain locations
 you can push rafts into each other and access the containers on the other raft
 wild dino spawn is screwed either does not spawn at all or spawns too much of the same 
 kind of dinos sometimes you can see 35 of the same level same species dino next to each other or 1015 sharks at the same spot
 your camera view gets stuck a lot only relog fixes it
 hitboxes are still terrible
 terrain invisible barricades grass stone floating in the air

these are only the ones that came to mind suddenly but beleive me there is more
its almost like the game is designed to favor exploiters to follow the old toxic path of ase

if you like to play in a toxic official environment with lots of exploits bugs glitches go ahead asa is for you 3


#####

41 cad for the new sa western content what a toxic company

#####

frames are trash even on low settings with a 3070ti how are we still making games that cant function

#####

remember when blizzard gave up on overwatch to release overwatch 2 a game with few differences besides the fact that it was far more monetized and greedy less content and devs that dont really care thats what happened to ark survival ascended its the same game dont let the made in unreal engine 5 sway you its ark survival evolved but with far far less content requires much higher specs to runeven then it crashes a lot 
admittedly i was having fun i put in about 170 hours into this game and was prepared to buy the cool cosmetics coming out on scorched earth because they said all there would be is paid cosmetics they lied in ase you were only paywalled by having to buy new maps but now the current state is that youll be on a map unable to use core features of said map and tame new dinos snail games has lost me and most everyone in my server with 40 active players a day and hundreds who have already beat the island i wish i could get a refund on the money i spent on this game because i never want to touch it if they go through with paywalled dinos and features on a map you already own 
i couldnt reccomend this game to anyone wildcard and snailgames are greedy and dont actually care about their game do not buy 410 only got 310 becuase it was kind of fun playing on a pve server with boosted rates and friends

#####

feels like a 40 hd texture pack

#####

the good ol tod howard move sell the same exact game bugs and all to the same fucking idiots who bought the first pile of shit

incredible we fall for this shit gamers are so fucking dumb myself included

#####

wtf i thought things were supposed to be different wild card i thought all those stupid bugs and crashes were supposed to be fixed cleaned up a thing of the past the new version on a new engine with newnothing aside from some tweeks to the terrain and it being a little prettier this game is ass i want to love it i do i forced myself at times to like ase i would joke around like everyone that the bugs and crashes were part of the game and if asa was free instead of you mfs snail fleecing us for another 40 bucks i might have the same opinion i took the charge as a sign that maybe they actually fixed it that they were ballsy enough to charge us again told me they must have fixed it right well shit was i wrong

this is some dude i made a game in my basement bullshit right here how can you not make a quality product with all your resources and all your brain power how how do you f#k up a do over now backed by millions of game sales all i was hoping for was ark but without all the bullshit crashing over water crashing over rexes crashing in my gd base requiring a quantum pc to play the game is also just more of the same shite as before how did they get this far without figuring out optimisation i dont usually write reviews but after loading into the game only for it to crash and boot me three times within 5 minutes wild card get fucked i feel like they are laughing at us they knew this was the same pig but with some lipstick and they released it and charged us for it anyways worse part is i cant even sell this shit to a game stop since its digital

#####

review will remain negative until crashes stop

if youre one of the few that doesnt experience any crashes im happy for you however you are not everyone my hardware is all less than a year old its stuff youd find in your favorite youtubers pcs what we have isnt a hardware issue based on the crash logs the issue actually comes from how the game handles its lighting generation and how that data is stored in the ram ie its a memory management issue its entirely possible they way they are managing their low level data does not work on other gpus vram architecture so please if the game doesnt crash for you move on instead of making yourself look like a belligerent retard who bought their pcs with their mothers credit card and doesnt understand low level memory management

#####

found out about the nitrado exclusivity too late now i own this useless game

update
apparently they changed it i havent been able to test but this should never have been the case in the first place

#####

constantly and i do mean constantly crashes im not saying anything others havent already but damn this game is the opposite of ready and definitely isnt worth 40

#####

have played ase for years loved every minute of it  have played with the same community for years  that is now not possible with asa  wildcard snail and nitrado have killed all the communities  this game is way more fun with others 100  that is no longer possible  nitrado have a strangle hold on servers and is charging an absolute fortune for small servers way beyond what many communities could afford

the game itself so far is just the same old ark with a few new features  quite a disappointment actually to what we were all hoping for so much more  the best new part is the baby wild animals  you can claim a wild baby and raise it up and being able to toggle thru a few more building options in one hit saves left over pieces  

if you love playing with others i would hold out until nitrado and wildcard make their mind up or most of us will be gone

#####

please kick nitrasho and snake games to the curb you want people to play your game makes servers cheaper to rent get rid of the snail games that has a worse rep if oj simpson and jeff dahmer had a child i cant even join a server if you want to play you have to sell yourself on the curb to some dude with a troubling marriage and low self esteem listen to your real ark enthusiasts give us something other than false promises

#####

not ready and highly overpriced for what it is a graphical update

#####

no self hosted server is a dealbreaker and would refund if i could
i want to be able to setup a few private server instances for personal use by myself and some friends

#####

i love ark but this company deserves all the bad reviews i can give shame on you scumbags

#####

got perma banned for being harassed by a alpha tribe  they started calling me racist names and being a cyberbully so i started talking smack back at them   i even ended up leaving the server and joinning a new server because of how rude they were and then they turn around screenshot it and get there whole tribe to report me and now im perma banned from the game  because they cant lock me in a cage anymore because i left the server  what a toxic game    mass perma ban report system is silly when they are the ones the started talking smack first too funny how the target gets banned for saying 1 word while they can harass me all they want and get away with it because im not saving screenshots trying to get them banned what a bad system

#####

if youve played ark especially since the begining you know what to expect

the performance is not great and ive had one or two crashes
but the game looks and feels beautiful
the creature ai is way better the animations look smoother and more realistic i got to behold that beauty when a swarm of piranha ate me up

it feels like ark and i do love ark

#####

please be so kind to vote this up so that the game developers and players can see this

i finally found out how to fix the game or the server crashing
there are two secret multipliers the game developers forgot to modify before release

in your gameusersettingsini add the following lines
randomcrashgeneratormultiplier  60
fullwindowscrashmultiplier  120

a setting of 60 for randomcrashgeneratormultiplier means the game or the server crashes every 60 minutes
a setting of 120 for fullwindowscrashmultiplier means your whole computer crashes every 120 minutes

unfortunately the default values for both multipliers were left on 10 after the final test before the release of the game

i hope this helps you out and have a nice day enjoying ark survival ascended 3

#####

pay 40 for a graphics upgrade for a game i have already paid for and have all the expansions for an upgrade that only looks any better on high settings which make the fps crash into the abyss and qols that are easily gotten on ark evolved with mods so playing with shittier graphics and without the mods i like without the maps i like for an extra 40 and instantly get trolled by a duo think ill just go ahead and refund this and go install evolved to fill my ark itch

#####

this should have been a free upgrade to all past arkse owners they never fixed the original game never delivered on tons of features that were promised now theyre not only trying to double dip this crap but theyre going to call this early access again drip feeding maps for the next year or longer so i guess ark 2 is a long way out and in need of money huh wildcard 

visually the game looks beautiful in the new engine but its literally just arkse with a facelift this should have been free and wildcardsnailgames are just greedy tencent money ws

oh and the decision to force people using 3rd party server providers to only be able to use nitrado was suuuuuuuuuuper shady im sure you got a nice kickback for that but nitrado is dog and their interface was literally the worst one out there well done

#####

my friend i play with said that if i post a review about the game and it gets 200 likes and 100 rewards hell buy me a bag of chips and a rtx 4090 so ill leave this here

#####

very rough rn to say the least

#####

look i have to be brutally honest with this review

coming from ase with 4000 hours i can safely say it was a game i was in love with for quite some time it goes down as an all time great for me in online mp games

although it had its bugs and issues the community and the half dozen maps kept thsi game thriving for 7 years even through the initial problems

here is where i feel a little cheated this game may have the name ark survival on it but its a shell of its former self the graphical upgrades are a small achievement on an otherwise stripped back version of the original game we love btw dont bother playing this game if you dont have at least a high 3000 series nvidia card or equivalent

noted issues

 the dino spawn count is easily 50 less it will take you all day to find something worth taming
 the build system has been overhauled however feels janky and less customised slower and annoying
 the graphical issues with this game right now are redic and will make your life hell
 there is one map and that one map is the island its the same map we all had 7 years ago it doesnt feel fresh and 
  playing it is an absolute labour for the same rewards you probably already achieved
 the colours they chose to use in this unreal 5 engine are straining and offensive to look at all beaches and rocks have a 
   very yellow tinge compared to the grey from ase and its very tough to look at for hours
 nitrado are scumbags and server hosting is bloated in price and unstable at the present

this is my final word dont buy this game until they can offer you more maps and less bugs period its failed to capture the same nostalgia and absolute awe its predecessor hadhas and may not get that back for quite some time

#####

i have been called multiple slurs

#####

graphics are great some bugs but in the last update they have added tracing ini file if you host your own servers they can now see where your server is how many your hosting and how many players use it this is spying on the biggest level and there is no info on the store page about them collecting data

#####

trash dont buy unless you like the pain of being ducked with no lube

#####

some snail game employees were going to get wiped on an official pvp server so they mass banned a tribe that were attacking them such a joke company the game has more bugs than the original bad game made by corrupt company that treats the players that support them like shit

#####

alrighty so let me start off by saying that my 16 hours of playtime is not anywhere near enough to give a full detailed review  i will be revisiting this post once ive played 30 or more and i can give a much more detailed response  this is more of a first impressions review

first off my specs are midtier at best  hell my processor technically falls below the minimum setting requirements and my ram and graphics card only just meet them  those are minimum settings btw  honestly its time to upgrade some parts  

that being said i am having a very hard time understanding why people are losing their minds over the performance of this game  i ran it while recording content for a video for whatever thats worth i dont know that it makes a difference and got decentish frames while running the game at mostly medium settings with some things like textures on epic  its absolutely playable  is it perfect  no  the performance does have issues theres no doubting that  i think a lot of this is massively overblown though or people need to take a long hard look at their settings ingame and on their computers  often times a second or third look usually reveals something  the anger is understandable if you have and youre still getting serious issues thats fair  if not remember that you have the almighty lord google to consult if you dont know all your system settings and how to mess with them

again it does not run perfectly  however it didnt stutter at all when i played it and ran consistently at 3545 fps especially after i turned off antialiasing and motion blur  well i turned antialiasing down to low but thats neither here nor there

now that i got that out of the way lets talk about the game  so far so good  i hopped in spawned in and after getting used to the frames and tweaking settings the game is gorgeous  it looks beautiful and i felt like i was back in 2016 or whatever year i bought ase and saw my first dinosaur patrolling the beach  you know the one where you hear the jurassic park theme in your head watching it move around lol  its tough to recapture that magic but it did  i was pleasantly surprised  and goddamn the sunset is glorious  also the hair and feathers actually look like hair and feathers  i definitely note that as opposed to the atrocious looking fur from ase  thats definitely worth nothing because hair and feathers are notoriously hard to model and animate

the new ui needs a little bit of work but i like the look of it  it definitely has a more cartoony look but that kinda works with ark anyways  still needs some finetuning  

character creation is improved though i wish it had a little more customization especially with the facial stuff  let me adjust my damn nose lol

the animations feel much smoother and both me and the creatures seem to interact with the world around them much more  like things have real weight to them and when you move your arms it feels like youre putting your body into it instead of the stiffer animations from ase  same with the creatures  theres weight when they move and they actually connect with the terrain much better  i have yet to see if the ai has been improved but im excited to see it

building system seems improved from what ive played  seems like you get more with less and it looks nice  not perfect but nice  hopefully there are more options to build crazy structureswhich i will then not use because im not patient enough for that  i will instead build the most efficient stone box in the universe lol

so far so good  not fantastic but im enjoying it  it has problems as people have mentioned though

like i said i cant be objective because i havent played the game enough so i will come back and edit this  i hope my first impressions help someone out though

#####

played the game a total of 3 times so far 2 of the times i logged in were random crashes during the procedure of trying to join a official server i notice amidst this a store page for the purchasing of mods and i can see the relation to bethesdas crimes against gamers already manifesting in a game company that has already betrayed their customers for greed time and time before as seen on the previous ark with snail games 
nevertheless i noticed immediately a game breaking bug which was present in the first ark lmao random antimeshing land mines theres nothing like walking around after grinding up a ton of resources and stepping on a invisible antimeshing land mine that doesnt kill you but just vanishes you and all your belongings on your character into the void then you are at the respawn menu wondering what the frick just happened until you look in your log and see you got antimeshed how have they not fixed meshing its been how many years now after that happened i just shut the game down and lost all interest in playing it again reminded by the 57k official hours i put in on the first ark dealing with bugs like this wildcard and snail games are just more names to a list of soulless companies powered by greed dont waste your money stick with the first ark and singleplayer playermade mods good job robbing people for their money hope it serves you well in this life and cuts you in half in the next figure of speech ofc

#####

i tried to tame a dodo and the game crashed

#####

id like to start just by warning that a very apparent rip from old code has been used to hasten development of asa likely due to the loan agreement between nitrado so there are legacy issues that are present in the current build such as meshing and with that smog cleared what is the game worth

currently id be looking for opportunities to buy this remastered version if it goes on sale especially if you currently have experience in ase but do not own all the dlc packs as all current ase dlc will be released in the future for no extra charge on asa however this is a tough game to run very heavy on systems with anything older than 20 series nvidia cards keep that in mind it has gotten better almost doubling my own performance as patches are released so keep your eyes and ears open for these improvements

the actual content of the game remains largely unchanged but of course and most noteably the graphics are night and day even in my tests on the lowest settings its quite a breathtaking look and every step up in the settings ladder further increases the fidelity thanks to ue5

there are also some incredible qol updates that current ark fans will froth at the mouth for such as building snapping as well as the new alignment tools both substantially more responsive and intuitive than its predecessor all building engrams have been collapsed into each other in some way or another such as all doorways wallswindows etc to reduce engram clutter and spending quick hotbar swapping to allow for easier hotbar equipable items to be accessed without having to open your inventory as well as ammo type swapping for weapons by holding a hotkey r by default some species have been upgraded for example oviraptors and dung beetles now automatically collect items rather than having to be given them manually from my own experience which may be skewed due to playing on a nondedicated server but collisions and hitboxes are way more reliable kaprosuchus dont jitter everywhere while dashing same with pteras and those pesky ichthyornis dont eat 4 arrows to the body before one finally registers as a hit

finally some more veteran players will notice sneaky alterations to the island map in many many poi locations increasing the vibrancy adding some more node spawns for resources ruins near explorer notes and just general cliff side visual enhancement i very much recommend exploring your favorite past base locations to see how theyve changed in my opinion most if not all for the better

overall being an ark fan i very much like this remaster and foresee a lot of time being put into this game in the future i recommend you give it a go if you are confident in running it and with a dash of hope and probably a bit of cope too wildcard will slowly correct the issues and bring this game to a similar glory as the previous

#####

        dumpster fire crashes about every 20 minutes but you can get that down to 5 to 6 if you turn on dlss  breath wrong have impure thoughts or a wayward neutrino passes through the planet within a couple hundred miles of your location this is on single player with
  ryzen 5700x3d
  4070 rtx
  32 gb ram
and yesm2 nvme ssdoh and medium graphics

#####

server crashes meshing doesnt get fixed 40 for a game i already had i cant play on server cause i cant connect a whole year no trailer no gameplay and than they released a unfinished game again i hope noone will buy ark 2 f wildcard f snailgames why they do this they could do such a nice game with a big player base but they do this pls dont buy you will do you a favor cause i was too long in the loading screen i cant refund this stupid game no fps with my 3060ti shootergame error still exists nothing good with this game you can even place teleorters in the mesh

#####

fun game but way to many crashes the first hour and a half was good not many issues but then the next 45 minutes it would crash every 2 minutes it is a shame because the graphics are way better and i didnt have bad performance fps wise but the crashes totally ruin things if the devs can fix this crashing i will rebuy the game as i said before its very fun and looks gorgeous now but all the crashes are not acceptable just check the forums its tons of complaints about the crashing

playing tons of other games lately and none of them are crashing bg3 starfield cybeprunk expansion etc it is strictly this game please fix it and i will be back

#####

love it ark is fun and now its beautiful pro tip disable menu transitions in the settings it will fix a ton of crash issues i think i only crashed twice all day after

#####

i tamed a bird named it poopy butt and then my game crashed

#####

i love this game
its absolutely beautiful even on lower graphic settings because i dont have a 8090 gpu

but guys pleeease fix some issues

why is there no autowalk i had to write a macro for one of my mouse buttons that literally writes wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww over and over

whats with that collision literally nothing is harder to escape than a compilation of your own compys because you cant push them away but they can push you you got drag weight on dinos why cant you determine which entity weighs more and is therefore be able to push another one away why cant i leave my house because my beloved spitty dilo blockes the door with the tip of his tail

then there is the artificial stup erm intelligence im walking a stone arch and the dinos following me are spreading like a fan and happily just fall off a cliff i could tolerate that if i would have tamed them by knocking them out with a club turning their brain into mush and killing all sense of self preservation but i didnt

the pathfinding awesome finally you cant lose wild dinos chasing you anymore by running around a cliff because they dont try the direct line of sight like in ase no they find a way to follow you miles away to eat you through a window in your own base
but the tamed ones literally cant follow you around a plain rock is there something wrong with the narcotics do they melt brains or something

side note on our beloved ichthyornis one of them just snatched and ate a full stack of narcotics from me how the hell is he still alive

#####

wildcard is ark  sad to not recommend i can no longer blindly support this dumpster fire of a company i put in over 1k hours on ase disregarding how broken it was just to get baited in to a fixed game sad day

1 unstable servers some things never change its still as cancerous as ase rollbacks crashes constant lag broken tame mechanics fixing one thing while breaking another  etc
2 arguably the worst dev team in history wildcard is notorious for cutting their nose off in spite of their face they seem to care little to none for the community striking under the table deals to profit more while damaging the community never listens to the community takes ages to respond to any ticket and even then is a piss poor effort wildcard is completely out of touch with the community they do the bare minimum and call it a good day they have no organization no priorities  no urgency  on top of that they lie without blinking i can go on all day about the dev team and why you should avoid anything they touch but i wont only if another company any other company had ark it would be game of the year

thats my rant the game has so much potential but is held back by a dev team that doesnt give a damn


#####

dinosaur

#####

so many bugs that still havent been fixed since the last game

#####

ark survival evolved is better

#####

this game is just survival evolved but with a reskin so just read that review if your pc can actually run it if it cant then there is 0 point in getting this now or the future as they havent implemented the other maps some of which was promised on launch which didnt happen makes you really ask damn couldve gotten evolved for like 10

honestly a disappointment 

graphical changes sometimes the color and lighting looks cool at specific moments and if you have a godlike pc then it might be worth as supposedly they are going to add all the maps with some new creatures with the pvp servers changes then it could be a fresh experience but the servers are also shit with high ping across the board performance is a joke unless they are legit trying to make another crysis benchmark for us if you try to play at a playable framerate60fps the graphics are just similar to evolved except maybe more vibrant colors

yes they added qol changes that is pretty big for this game as the original was already riddled with their clunky menus but that seems to be the biggest change in my opinion they also advertised better pathing which may be working like 15 better as only 14 of your dinos get lost while following you through a forest yaaay

for the mf that says its good it really aint i know its pretty much advertised as such where its just a graphical change and it semi delivered you cant deny wildcard is hitting the shitter with this as there was little to no advertisment outside of the core ark fans and discord no better servers no new maps need a 4090 to even run medium settings with good frames making private servers exclusive to 1 company before people would compete to make better servers and a diff experience than vanilla like can someone tell me the value of this game other than it being a cash grab

pvp
and for the pvpers its also more dino than tek based so thats cool for pvp servers are still trash havent played on evolved servers b4 but when i asked around the ping and dinos jumping from place to place seems to be common the dinos jumping around isnt terrible until you get stuck in a pack within a literal instant and cant fight back there you go your level 200 tame that took 12 hours getting to that point to only have the server shit on you not to mention the constant server crashed and rollbacks the game punishes you more than the people and we aint talking about the dinos

my pc for power reference
amd ryzen 7 5800x 8core processor                380 ghz
amd radeon rx 6700 xt graphics card nvidia 3070 equivalent

they spent resources and delayed ark 2 for this bs bruh





#####

refunded the game is poorly optimized and practices unethical server hosting practices

#####

rtx 3080 and can only get 50fps on low settings this is in no way shape or form a better game

#####

for anyone having fps issues just put this in your launch options for asa youre welcome

#####

im from australia and this game just feels like a normal day small spiders tho

#####

id like to start off by saying i have a 4080 i9 13900k 32gb ddr5 and running this on an ssd any game ive played so far ive been able to on max settings this game runs terribly on any setting and seems to be poorly optimized constant crashes with the added penalty of having to spam connect on servers for 2030 minutes before getting let in just to crash again of the 2 hours ive played at least 1 full hour was spent trying to connect to any server another embarrassing game launch

#####

just thought id help out with peoples frames by this review use this command rvolumetriccloud 0 it removes the clouds youll be looking at double the frames and you can use

rstreamingpoolsize 0 unlocks ur whole gpu memory

rnanitemaxpixelsperedge 4 reduces triangles for nanite meshes

rlumenscreenprobegatherradiancecacheproberesolution 16 optimizes lumen

rdynamicglobalilluminationmethod 2 disables lumen

rvolumetriccloud 0 disables volumetric sky

rshadowquality 0 disables all shadows

these will help with frames but beleive me removing the clouds is a frame changer good luck peeps also i have 7900xtx 7800x3d cpu and ddr5 6600mhz ram and i get about 90100 frames on mediumhigh and when i just remove the clouds i get 190 ive also said the same to tribemates who have alot worse cards and its doubled their frames hope this helps

#####

basically unplayable bullhit even worse than the first game instead of fixing the old bugs they added triple amount of them fix your dumb servers god i am mad buy old ark and dont waste money on this money grab updates from this should have been free it is like atlas 2 but with more bugs and less fun i thought that i cant feel hate yet here i am

#####

i want to love this trying to play with a buddy is a miserable lagfest and all the servers are full so you cant even join official servers

#####

ive played the game for 14 hours now the first day patch already helped a bit ive gone from 2845 fps to 5060 fps with some ocasional drops with a 3070 and a rayzen 5 5600x the changes in construccion are great its way easyer to build than in survival evolved also the dino ai changed a bit ive noticed some of them go in pack to hunt like raptors others that were peaceful fight back and they have babies
overall good changes and looks gorgeous very good to still be an early access

#####

ark descended

#####

i just cant

i tried to get even a tiny bit excited for asa but its once again just a miserable show of what happens when you sell your company and game out to a soulless megacorp publisher that only cares about making a few bucks

since its launch it has been riddled with insane performance gameplay and server issues and gamebreaking sometimes pc breaking bugs its like were back in 2016 ark i do not recommend anyone buys this upgrade because its strictly a visual upgrade which has left the game consuming so much vram that nitrados servers cant even handle how much information is going on

save your money dont buy this title let wild card sink let snail games sell them and ark off i genuinely believe this games only hope is that wild card goes bankrupt and sells the ip to another company

#####

we all knew this was going to happen

its just like i remember in 2015 buggy crashing constantly and poorly optimized and yet im still probably going to play this for hundreds of hours

#####

positives its ark

negatives its ark

#####

i am a 50 year old father probably one of the oldest people playing this game
i am a single father for my son who is now 14 years old my son has recently started playing ark survival ascended
in less than a week he has already played more than 20 hours
it was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son
because he was always with his friends or watching youtube videos
so i decided to create a steam account to play with my son i started playing but it was my first time playing a video game since the 90s so i was pretty lost i asked my son for help and we spent several hours together playing this game
i liked it as it was the best time i have had with my son since my wife died playing video games reminded me that there is fun in everything and it brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside of the house

#####

45 to 30 fps on a 3080 on medium settings lol

#####

edit after 20 hours ive had nothing but issues dinos spawns are not working tames disappearing constant crashes and performance is all over the place dont bother wait for sale

jesus i dont even know where to begin over 6 delays and they missed their launch day window entirely 

graphics look better textures are more realistic but barely dinosaurs barely look improved and you would have to get extremely close to tell water looks great minus the foam particles snow is compacted with visible footprints light shafts look good on max settings but be prepared to lose frames or get buggy effects when turned down added fog makes the forests a bit spookier rain no longer blinds you and actually looks like water particles then you get to foliage its the same exact models and textures used before but now leaves fall off when being harvested except when you fully harvest something the entire plant reappears then sinks into the ground trees fall but they land with almost no impact and float above the ground rocks crack as you harvest but after the first few you notice they all share the same texture on repeat and realize how unimpressive it looks these new ue5 features look like they were made by wildcards interns not a proper developer 

performance man the game runs absolutely terrible without dlss and with dlss it doesnt get much better there are still chugs and stutters like the previous release especially when loading larger areas i can barely keep a stable 30 with a 3080ti and i712700k with dlss its anywhere between 40 and 70fps and bounces around nonstop while looking choppy and washed out 

gameplay there are very few noticeable changes character creation is slightly better the ui is cleaner but just as clunky to navigate the dinos still have their same odd animations but also create massive destruction in forested areas which seems really cool and could easily startle someone dinos like the diplo no longer constantly aggro and attempt to nudge you off the map but instead feed on brush and trees there are now wild babies that follow a parent which adds to the realism and potentially makes taming more interesting i also struggle greatly to see any cliffs or hills due to how dense the foliage is resulting in multiple deaths from falling

honestly i dont think these changes are worth the asking price at all the best thing about this remaster is that you dont have to wait 10 minutes between loading screens with an ssd these features should have been given via a free update though maybe at most a 10 upgrade but wildcard and snail games dont seem to care much about good will or a positive reputation among their fansplayers and would rather charge close to the price of a full game with no discounts for owners of survival evolved give it a year or two to iron out the kinks get all the content youre paying for and hopefully wait for a massive sale

#####

i still stand by my original review which can be found below however i feel that with all the shit i have given wildcard in the last few years its only fair for me to return and say that after being gifted the game by a friend and asked to give it a second change i am back to say that the game is gorgeous utterly beautiful and while it would be nice to run it on high settings it is not necessary because even on medium that game looks beyond ultra settings on most similarly aged games the quality of life improvements and the mainstreaming of certain tedious tasks has improved the overall gaming experience of ark so while wildcard still has room for improvement and optimizations to make the game even better and more to what i imagine they and the community would like the game to be wildcard has done an amazing job in just a few short weeks of bringing the game up to par for what i expected at launch and i for the first time in a long time am excited for the future of the game somehow they took a nearly decade old game reskinned it made some minimally massive gameplay changes and managed to make an old game feel new not just new but better than the original a task very few sequels and remasters ever achieve


im only here because they but an obnoxious block in the prior game anyway play 30 minutes with a 3060ti and couldnt get above 24 fps refunded the game i will say wildcard did a great job capturing the nostalgia of the launch of the prior game with the same inability to play this one unless you build a computer specifically around this game

#####

absolutely broken nothing new will be spending 5k hours on it


#####

my 3060 card cant handle this games tt

#####

still no human breeding

#####

big disappointment tons of bugs no controls in other languages they dont work and keybindings dont save
if you change graphics settings you cant press half the buttons anymore

optimization is horrendous even on high instead of epic settings game looks like 60 worse

what in the world is this studio thinking releasing the same game with no new content for more money in such a crappy state with all the old bugs present 

avoid this game

#####

last game good
this game good
need pc that can make heat for the winter
it will make heat
i like heat in the winter
so i like dis game
last game was worse it made less heat

#####



























yeah i play this game at 22 fps on low so what

#####

honestly my gpu is a 2080 and no real major issues however it does crash quite often and the stability of nitrado servers are terrible not to mention it still isnt the most optimized game after remaking it into an entirely newer engine

#####

this game is infinitely better than the original yes it needs some optimization for fps but other than that this game blew me away with the small changes i experienced audio changes ui changes drop crate animations etc and the visuals are just stunning i myself am running a 3080 fe with a i910900k oc at 50ghz with 32g of ram i was getting 70 fps on medium settings on the beach and a little inland flying through the redwood forest and into the volcano i was getting around 4050 i understand people are a little upset about this but it can only get better in all honesty i was surprised i was getting that good of fps out of the box couple months and this game will be smooth as butter 

some testing i did just to see how the game looks and feels compared to the first were as follows
i built a 3x3 thatch hut and upgraded it to stone thatch looks honestly not horrible the outside not showing the supports is nice and soft looking as it should since its just woven fiber the ceiling has a realistic feel to it by letting some sun in again because its woven fiber its not airtight like wood or stone nice change of pace for thatch
changing to wood was also a nice change the inside supports felt real and necessary rather than just there for the visuals
stone however was by far my favorite i can say wholeheartedly builders who focus on aesthetics are going to love the changes stone has a very medieval castle vibe to it unfortunately the ceiling looks like minimal changes were made to it and looks very similar to the original
i also want to say the new mechanic where you can have a wall and that wall is a window and door and secret door wall that turns like a secret bookcase is amazing and no longer do you have to unlock every wall like the old game theyre all tied into one engram makes building a lot more user friendly i feel like

i also wanted to go see how caves looked so i explored the south side easy cave to my surprise it wasnt overly dark it was actually quite lit with the mushrooms and foliage added inside also a very nice change i like was the addition of mineable crystals i always hated having to find some mountain to get crystal from so this was a nice change unless im stupid and that was always there

while exploring the cave as per ark the stuttering walking in the cave was large but once you walk in the stuttering subsided completely again as per ark but to my surprise walking out of the cave had only a 12 second stutter until all was fine again this game has fps issues yes but comparing it to its predecessor this game is a lot better 

the map changes are also amazing just the small addition to more trees and rocks makes the game feel a lot more real and not bland like the old game also the animations for cutting trees and the cracks that appear in a rock when you mine it are very nice and looks a lot better than the old game my favorite feature thus far is easily the visual of picking a plant and the leaves being picked rather than spamming interact then the bush just randomly breaks 

i also wanted to see how raptors looked since the picture looks so good they look great and i had this amazingterrifying experience i went to knock one out after hitting it with a bola as i was knocking the one out that i had tied up from the trees i hear the jurassic park sound the calling for help raptor sound and i look up to see a raptor charging me while he was charging me the tied up raptor started to respond with the same call i dont know if the raptors were communicating or if it was just some crazy coincidence but nonetheless super cool interaction this game is way scarier than the original

i also want to add my night experience and simply say the game is not darker than a black hole like the original its actually very well lit but not to much the darkest it was for me during night was when it was late night and a storm rolled in even then i could still see the obelisks at night are so gorgeous its unreal red ob looks terrifying off in the distance with its red glow green looks inviting blue unfortunately was covered in clouds so i couldnt see it 

i ended my single player experience with a journey to carno island to find a rex to look at as usual there were a lot of argentavis at the island i can confirm they definitely looked at color variations and color combinations the argies there were gorgeous i saw a black and teal one an all black one i know thats not new but it looked nice and another that i think was all teal but died before i could find it i died by finding a rex and to my pleasant surprise when the rex roared at me it kicked my off my pt and then proceeded to murder myself and my tame again i dont think that feature was in the base game i think only yuties can do the roar fear affect if they are and this feature is new then it makes rexs somewhat more viable in a pvp sense

the changes that have been made in this game makes me confidently rate this game a 810 the fps issue will be resolved the visuals are amazing as is the water physics ui and audio changes make the game feel so much smoother and user friendly compared to the old game the map additionschanges make the map feel more real and less empty overall 40 dollars for a remaster may seem steep and maybe even ridiculous but i can assure you itll be worth it it can only get better

#####

ark may have ascended but its performance sure as hell didnt

#####

spawn lag freeze crash rinse and repeat

#####

exclusivity with nitrado servers made it so i cant even open this game without being disgusted 

yes im aware they allowed personal dedicated for hosting but server providers arent allowed ie if you want a managed hosting your only choice is nitrado

absolutely scum there is no point in playing this game if i cant run my servers like i did in ase

idk much about how the actual game plays i bought this and then immediately after nitrado started their whole fiasco i didnt even play it

for the 25 seconds i ran around the beach it felt amazing but im not gonna go through another ark redevelopment if we cant even have competent publishers  higher ups that work at wc  snail they cant even go through the effort of communicating what happening to their community so what is the point of even bugtesting their game for them its essentially what you are doing if we cant have clear and transparent communications with wc its not like wc will listen to use after reporting said bugs just look at ase for a ripe example of that

a great game ruined by corporate greed its sad to see

#####

at the current state the game is in im going to have to leave a negative review
with how extremely unoptimised the game is and i really want to emphasise how unoptimised it is many crashes the constant bugs the extremely delayed release lack of communication from wildcard  especially the server issues the game is simply unplayable to many

my biggest complaint has got to be the contract between wildcard and nitrado forcing users to use nitrado hosting making them a monopoly this is a huge loss for many hosting providers supporting and especially creating monopolies should never be okay and with that it has lead to leave a very bad taste in my mouth

now just because the studio has made poor decisions doesnt mean the game is all bad the game looks great lots of new qol changes and improvements new features and sound design if i was to forget about everything i stated previously i definitely would suggest this game to anyone who enjoyed the first ark game

this review may change in the future but at the time i am posting this i unfortunately cannot suggest this game nor do i support wildcard creating a monopoly of hosting providers

edit wildcard has updated their policy allowing users to host as many servers as you wish without a licence and you may now receive tips and donations

great job to everyone who signed the petition we stood up as a community and we got what we wanted

with this multiple bug updates and small optimizations have been made day by day we are making it closer to a playable game and more and more positive reviews

#####

i see why this game was released in october
the performance is horrific and the bugs are outright terrifying

#####

i dont often leave reviews but wanted to weigh in on ark survival ascended

as far as content its ark survival evolved remastered its exactly what youd expect from a remaster and exactly what youd expect if not a bit better from an early access title its got amazing graphics and some much needed quality of life improvements but also some bugs and crashes

theres been some drama around the hardware needed to run the game and the state of personal dedicated servers both were reasons i didnt pick this up day one however these have mostly been resolved so i picked it up day three its still in the realm of crysis levels of frame rate and settings but its perfectly playable if it gets better ill be even happier while server documentation is scarce and from what i can tell only windows is available they have released drm free server files

all of this to say my immediate concerns have been addressed and im overall satisfied with the state of the game as it exists today im eager to see how the title evolves pun intended and look forward to further optimizations and content

#####

ill recommend this game for a very very select group of players

if you have a powerful computer have played and like ark survival evolved and didnt mind the jankiness particularly early on dont hate that theres only one pretty mediocre map and are ready to be fleeced for additional mapsex packs are willing to mess a bit with settings to get acceptable fps and no crashes btw disable foliage and water interaction if you crash to desktop a lot and have low expectations for any fixes to any of the above then yes i recommend asa

everyone else should just getkeep ase and play abberation or ragnarok with mods on a private server

#####

dino sore


#####

a terrible dinosaur game its unfortunate that i gotta play it 1k hours just like the last one

#####

game is beautiful but avoid nitrado game hosting

#####

game has dinosaurs so i give 1010

#####


 
are you wasting my money again son
 
  
 
  
 
 
 

  





 

#####

a bronto took a dump on my face and the game crashed

#####

pros

prettier than ever
major qol improvements
build system is so much better now
it has otters
about 60 the size of the old ark

cons

launch got borked
console got delayed
still work to do under the hood as of this writing hence the early access
no longer able to do emotes while moving 

if you had the last one and you got the rig for it go ahead and get it if you havent already but most of us did if youre new and wondering wtf the big deal is get it on sale and be prepared to always be rejected by your friends when it comes time to play it 

this is not a game for the faint of heart it takes a special sort of masochist to enjoy ark if youre someone who will beat a game just to spite the game welcome home if youre someone who expects sameday customer support stick to ffxiv

now if youll excuse me i have a map to civilize

#####

i have a gambling addiction

#####

edit 

since the numerous patches and updates have gone through things have gotten better however there are still a few bugs and errors during play

1 tames do not stay situated in rafts and can move through walls during raft movement to the point they get left behind
2 there are still periodic fatal error crashes during game play
3 server ping is very high still causing significant lag
4 i am rather disappointed at the way in which official pve still operates players pillaring entire regions of the map still occurs without actually using those areas and there is no solution to this i personally believe pillaring should be classed as griefing when it gets to a point that others can no longer join the server and build in it to progress in the game out of fear those who would normally no pillar areas resort to doing it to combat those who do our of selfishness 
5 getting stuck to tames walls rafts and other objects occur frequently it is good that i have not experienced meshing personally but renders the game as frustrating still due to the inability to move when under attack

i cannot change my recommendation status yet until the game has a solid foundation of play through and a solution to the above that does not involve buying your own server when you mainly play on your own or in twos 

the ark survival ascended team surely bit off way more than they could chew when promising to deliver this remastered version 

issues identified so far

1 many players experiencing performance issues and crashes even when pc specifications are great 
2 crashes result in deletion of progress in personal sessions to the point that most of the game play feels wasted
 a experienced entire base being deleted
b experienced stats reverting back to previous session
c engrams load in on a previous level or show minus points when leveling up
3 the server volume is insignificant to cope with a very loyal niche fan base who have been forced to purchase the game twice because legacy servers have been wiped 
4 high ping and latency means servers are unstable often resulting in disconnection followed by an inability to reenter the server due to the number of people trying to get in
5 i have a high end graphics card rtx 4090 and yet there are still unstable graphic elements even though for the most part the game looks pretty i noticed it mostly in water 
6 the developers posted this game in early access because they knew the game was unstable and were forced to release it due to financial time constraints and legal terms this should be a huge red flag as far as game development is concerned especially given how many prime examples of over promising there are cyberpunks early release bugs is a great example 
7 the developers appear to be enthused about delivering a great experience but it seems their attempts to retain loyalty stemmed from the feedback they had about ark 2 all in all the asa announcement was rushed 


overall this game is likely going to end up with a few additional problems in the future
1 when the bugs are finally addressed the price will likely go up to reflect the stability of the platform further alienating existing customers 
2 as a result of point one those who are tempted to get a refund on this game and buy back in later when it is stable might be apprehensive creating a sense of resentment and feeling conned into keeping the game 
3 we have already experienced the feeling of deception when the price was offered at 5 soon to go up to an astonishing 45 we know the developers needed the money to remaster the game but their research and development into ue5 and having plenty of practice and experience seemed to be lacking they would have been better off waiting until they had the expertise to execute a remake efficiently 
4 because of this deception in point 3 im left with the feeling that the promised dlc will end up at our expense too i doubt i am the only one who feels this way how can you guarantee the developers are loyal to their fans when there is already a pattern of changing plans and charging people 
 
please please please wildcard and snail games address the above issues and fast you have some serious work to do the end of 2024 before this game is truly ready is an insult you already released it

#####

runs better then me nan shes dead

#####

dont do it trust me

#####

i know i do not have a lot of asa play time but i have over 2000 hours in ase so i can definitely easily compare the two and give some help if thinking about purchasing this version

want to play with other people well unless you plan on getting a private server they took down all the official ase servers

better graphics asa has much better graphics and i love the physics and collision in asa but this game just like ase for years it is very taxing on your gpu and cpu  you can tweak the settings to make it a little more stable if cpu is an issue try turning down or off the physics physics take a ton of cpu if you are having graphic problems try disabling any skyclouds first then work down from there till you get it playable to your liking

mods in asa might be easier to access via right in game however i do not like how they do it firstly the ui for the mods sucks and secondly the consistently take mods down that have material they personally dont approve of in it which makes it incredibly hard to do certain kinds of mods and the fact they now have premium mods like seriously stop trying to scam the shit out of your consumers if is fine to try helping the mod makers earn some money but we all know why it is really in there and it has nothing to do with the mod makers

i honestly like the main gameplay it could have been optimized better for sure but its got some amazing graphics but the devs are as usual more worried about making money off things rather then fixing things and smoothing out the things already in the game no surprise there

if you just want a dino survival builder you can play with your friends ark survival evolved is your better bet but if you want gauged for every penny you have any way they think they can get away with asa is for sure your game we all know they said the expansions would be free but i highly highly doubt that will be the case when they start releasing them it will be another back peddle oh for x reason and x reason we have to charge you for them now

overall its a beautiful remaster of the game and is enjoyable once you get the graphics tuned well enough to play on your comp without too much problems there is still lots of bugs and will always be lots of bugs just like ase but asa definitely has a more immersive and realistic feel to its game play with the additions that were made in the ue5 asa version of the game  

if you enjoyed ase and want to see it with better graphics asa might be for you but i would highly recommend waiting until their is a sale before picking it up honestly ark would have been soon much better if the same concept was done by other companies but its still a good pair of games 

i think i covered all that really matters but ultimately  i would suggest ase over asa any day at its current state

#####

nitrados monopoly on server hosting is going to kill this game

#####

never in my life have i seen a remaster of a game come out in early access

#####

i have a 3060 ti ryzen 5 5600x 32 gb of ddr4 ram and i get 45fps on lowest settings on spawn beach thats before ive gone into the dense forestry areas before ive got dinos before ive got tech before ive done anything remotely fps demanding i wouldnt recommend to anyone with low specs or even mid specs basically anything lower than what ive got dont waste your money unless you see positive reviews in the future saying performance has been fixed

#####

i miss the game taking 500gb of hard disk space made me feel so full and loved

i should mention this game runs significantly worse than the original which if you think about it is good because that means that this does everything the original does but better better because it achieves a lower frame rate on even lower settings studio wildcard is truly the best at what they do making unoptimized games

#####

 brief overview i wish there was a neutral option to select i love ark and i love that they are attempting to remaster it the ui is a lot better the building is better and i am enjoying all of that however my computer is a beast and i experience issues running this game even with everything on its lowest setting the trees and bushes have physics that tank me when i am running around in the woods that i have turned off i chug a lot when i am flying i am lucky that i can 80 play this game in this state because i have a lot of friends who cant

 gameplay the gameplay itself graphics issues aside is a lot easier now than it was in survival evolved things are easier to find and navigate when i first started playing evolved i didnt even want to because i felt like everything was so difficult to navigate i felt intimidated to even try however i did and eventually things became second nature to me if i was a beginner starting out with this ui i think i would have felt a lot less intimidated when i finally moved to playing ark on pc and was convinced to try out mods from friends all i ever really wanted to add in was s i dont feel like i am having as stressful of a time building in this version and trying to line things up in a way that pleases my organization desires

 bugs and technical issues this game is so unoptimized right now and i know that they will probably figure it out in time but as of right now its going to be a huge barrier to people playing on lowend computers even with turning your settings all the way down it is still a nightmare my game will be running fine for a little while and then all of a sudden i will hit a wall where i am frozen in the air or in the middle of a compromising situation that i fear for my life in which is not something i want to have to worry about if i am trying to transport a dinosaur all the way across the map or something also i know this isnt a gameplay issue but the way nitrado servers are set up right now is a nightmare 

 user interface and accessibility the ui is 100 the most pleasing change about this game right now textures and visual changes could be up there if they didnt tank your whole system but the ui is a huge improvement that i am happy with ease of access and using visuals to help navigate the ui make it more accessible the thing i am facing the most accessibility issues with right now is server setup there arent as many options laid out for you to tick and untick things ive learned a lot about tweaking the game ini on nitrado myself in these past few days but if i hadnt been doing this for over a decade i would probably want to rip my hair out

 replayability i can play this game fine even with the chugging here and there and i will because i am an ark nerd ill be playing through all the games issues ill be playing through the entire story lets go

 personal impressions i love ark ive been playing this game for over a decade with different groups of friends and its always a good time with lots of laughs and memories im looking forward to doing it again id like to experience it with more of my friends though so having it be more optimized would be cool im hoping in time it will get better i am having my moments though last night i tried to transport 80 crystal halfway across the map on the back of a raptor and i was chugging so much that by the time i got back i was just done for the night im only putting up with it right now because i cant imagine that its going to stay that way forever and its not always that bad

 conclusion right now id give it a 610 only because i can play it i am having fun and i enjoy how everything looks im getting back in there learning more and i always love the experience of developing silly little attachments to my dinos but there is definitely a lot that needs to be worked on and i have some friends who can not run multiplayer at all right now so that makes me sad because i want to share the experience with them i am going to give a thumbs up because i think if you can run it and afford it its worth it to dive in right now and dip your toes into watching as all of this develops however if you know that you will not be able to run this on your system do not try wait it out its a struggle

#####

ark survival ascended is a good game if you like the ark franchise its literally the same game as ase which is no surprise since it is a remaster if you are expecting a new game unreasonably do not buy it  if you are unwilling to deal with the pitfalls of early access lag bugs crashes glitches limited content scope do not buy it save yourself the complaining 

but if you are okay with progressing the process of basically paid beta testing and want to enjoy that feeling of going through original arks life all over again do buy it  it is a straight upgrade in terms of quality of life and will continue to operate as the evergreen version of ark with new content 

would i recommend the game on two conditions 

1 as noted above  if and only if you are okay with it being early access and full of bugs glitches and poor optimization  
2 you have a good system the game is hard to run and requires very good system specs if you have anywhere near the min specs dont bother even the recommended specs arent that great running the game  if you do not have a very good gpu at least a 4070 rtx with preferably 1216 gigs of vram and a good cpu with lots of ram you will unlikely be able to experience the game to its fullest  vram is also very important 8 gigs of vram does work but is not optimal for max settings and on the highest settings will likely lead to crashes even if you have good fps   on my 4070 rtx i can run the game on mostly high at decent fps due to dlss and framegen about 5070 but the game is very unstable and will randomly crash be warned  you can go days without crashes playing 6 hours a day or more and then you crash every 10 min logging into the game 

but i like the game and am willing to see it through up to you 




#####

had to rename my server lt dan because apparently it doesnt have any legs to run

edit 6 months later and a new pc best game ive ever played breathtaking

#####

just like ase the game is a lagging and glitching mess off launch
definitely a great game but i wouldnt buy it in its current state


#####

what the fuck wildcard you up the price not even 24 hours after you rerelease a game that everyone complains is dogshit this company seriously needs to get its priorities straightened out

#####

i still hate this game but at least its pretty now 

#####

2070 super 16 gb ram 2700x and the game runs just fine crashed once and one launch issue but the game itself is fine mediumhigh setting and constant 6070fps which considering ase didnt get much higher its good enough for me rvolumetriccloud 0 is a must do if you dont have a super computer and want good frames

#####

mmm dinosaur game me like dino me like game game good mmm i spent 40 more dollars for a game ive played before mm i still like yes good graphic good mm

#####

it is amazing if you arent crashing every 20 minutes

#####

your life will be much better if you never touch this game for your own good dont buy it

#####

i was worried when purchasing this game because of the awful reviews surrounding it
however after playing for hours with no crashing i can honestly say this game is amazing
it is beautiful and realistic
i appreciate the attention to the jumping problem in the previous game and also that all the dinos have re vamped coloring and breeding
there are babies just roaming the map with the ability to imprint if the parent is dead or gone
i appreciated the rework of the island map and feel that the raft is bit more useful this time around
the resources are still abundant and the dinos seem to be better leveled around the map unlike the first ark
i have encountered many more different dinos and level 150 ones that i have ever seen on default settings

in order to optimize it for a lower end pc you must turn off clouds and fog
it lowers the gpu load a lot from there you can tweak it to your liking 

to do that you will need these console commands

rvolumetriccloud 0
rvolumetricfog 0

you can enable console commands in the settings before entering the game

happy dino hunting 3

#####

messed around with video settings for 2 hours now cant get my refund

#####

very good game but my pc catches on fire everytime i start it

#####

you know its a scam when they release a remake in early access 

this game runs horrible i have 3080 and i barely get 50fps with medlow settings 

servers are a hot garbage we have been only able to play for 2 hours so far i would refund this if i could

do not buy

#####

its never looked more insanely good i can actually feel myself being murdered by creatures

jokes aside minus some day one issues ark has never looked so stunning and run so well so far ive really enjoyed revisting the island we all know so well but the qol and ui changes will be great for newcomers to the game never a better time to join in

streamed it as well no fps issues to speak of some bugs occasionally

httpswwwyoutubecomlive0yllrbocolufeatureshared

edit for the few accusing me of making performance up check out the content posted here i even did a 4k 60fps video presentation of the island

#####

i am writing this review as i do not believe it is worth to pay full price for a remake of a game which has so many issues at the start first they are hesitant to say the day in the trailer release then sudden it is said it will be on the same day

they then make a mistake in the timezone conversion alright this can happen after that we got few delays as they were still compiling the game wait what on release hour still compiling the game

finally after 8 hours we log in start building and suddenly after 2 hours all servers taken down because they forgot to disable admin bc people where getting admin and wipe everything

the company is a joke you should not support a company that communicates badly and leave everything on the last minute

other than that the game looks great but can be quite intensive on your hardware i said before its worth half of the price but now id recommend to wait until they fix their stuff

edit 
gonna add the following there been some server issues and it is still on going now i dont mind to rub this under the carpet as in launch issues since the hype is real however they havent given any updates while a lot of servers are being down for 3 hours and counting which is very aggravating the players

edit 29102023
a new update after few days which is mostly positive

the support
for all the bugs we encountered they do work through the weekend thats a good thing servers start to get more and more stable unfortunately still not fully ready currently you can expect multiple updates per hour

now also about the game itself after playing and trying to ignore the bugs this is actually what ark supposed to be from the beginning building is way way better things snaps better even any other item can be set to snap or not like mortar and pestle on foundations

you see more information as well and i love that they combined items instead of for every little thing their own recipe

i also love you can see your taming progress from a distance which is very helpful

graphics wise it is a beautiful game as well however it does take a heavy pc to run it 
currently i am running on 3080 on mixed settings

edit several weeks later still they have not fixed the server crashes as if they no longer care i just cannot recommend this game as long they do not fix the game

next to that i do feel like half of the crashes is thanks to their shitty contract with nitrado nitrado cant handle ark servers is a fact but unfortunately it is not only limited to ark servers i read loads of complaints about nitrado in general

come on wildcard fix these 2 issues so i can start recommending the game

#####

pfft you thought you could play an ark game

well you made the same mistake i did

#####

thousands of hours in ase and i will say outright to avoid this game money hungry devs who never stopped cash grabbing

the typical fast food is between 1020 a dinner at a mid range restaurant is around 2040 for the price of this game you could grab a mid range dinner with a couple friends and come out if it with a memory more worth while than every time youve been beaten to death on the beaches of this game treat yourself laugh with some friends face to face you deserve it

#####

my pc burst into flames after playing this game for 17 hours straight

#####

if you like ark survival evolved youll love ark survival ascended

#####

do not buy until they fix performance issues i was trying to run it with a 3060 ti and a decent cpu and was not even able to run stable 60 fps with low settings and even barely getting any fps after using commands to remove unnecessary decals

#####

cant even go 2 minutes before my game crashes

#####

honestly the game is good but 400 gb 
is this a some sort of competition  for corrupting our space  
i wont recommended at all because it has a lot of frame drop and freezing like this 
graphic is not strong for a 400gb game    so dont buy it and play it unless you can spare some money for new hdd or ssd 
but at least it much more better than  mario or zelda or last of them part garbage and part sending jewel to hell or even god of useless pic of sheets or copy of tomb raider so called unfuckingcharted 

so just laugh at my trolls and do what you want

#####

this game cost me everything

i play well played most games with a gtx 1060 ti not exactly the most powerful piece of machinery but she was a fighter and got me through many a modern game i had absolutely no problems playing through ase and figured i would give this game a try i mean how bad could it possibly be 

well i would soon find out i started the download at 7 am today and after a nice 8 hour stint i was finally able to open up the game at 307 pm almost immediately my computers fans kicked on which was not abnormal given the tech i was working with i turned all of the graphics down to the lowest they could possibly go i had to give my computer a fighting chance and then clicked through the main menu bit by bit my fans picked up speed getting louder and louder as i made my way through the character creation screen the frames werent great i was getting about 2030 fps but all things considered it could have been a lot worse with my horrendously disfigured character so bad that even the habsburg family would have been disgusted complete it was finally time to take the leap of faith into asa

as the game world slowly loaded my pc fans begun to even faster it felt like any moment my pc would simply take flight and the sound my fans were making was horrendous it was almost as if they were screaming my computer began to radiate heat i was a little worried so i gave it a quick tap to check its temperature and immediately burned my finger in pain but relatively still unfazed i decided to continue on thats when i saw it light the game was finally done loading i was about to play asa i heard the signature starting music as my computer screamed in the background my room was starting to get hot i began to sweat slightly with everything loaded i took my first step forward in game i only had a single fps and a dream but i was determined to play this masterpiece after pressing w again i took my next step in game 15 seconds later i was overcome with excitement it was finally happening i was playing asa it took me another two minutes but i walked around the rock i first spawned by and that is when i saw it the beautiful ocean i was truly awe struck that moment alone made the whole 9 hours it took to get there totally worth it but then it dawned on me the screaming had stopped and in its place i smelled something smoke 

i quickly looked down at my pc and saw that like the caveman i was playing in game i too had managed to start a fire at first the blaze was relatively small and probably would have been pretty manageable for someone with a level head but i began to panic i got up from my desk and grabbed my limited edition fullsize hatsune miku pillow from nearby off of my bed and began to frantically beat my flaming pc with it this only made things worse and soon my beloved hatsune was also on fire i dropped her onto my carpet floor after all when i whispered in her ear every night that i wanted our love to be full of fire and passion that is not what i meant and ran out of my apartment door the blaze quickly spread and when i eventually made it outside i realized that i had done nothing to alert the other residents in my building i didnt even pull the fire alarm i also realized i forgot to put on pants i sat outside once again awe struck and i watched the building slowly become engulfed in flames

i would later find out that not everyone would make it out of the fire in total six people died that evening including my beloved hatsune all of my possessions were destroyed in the fire and i dont have any sort of insurance so now here i am sitting at a bus stop cold and half naked with nothing left to my name except for my shirt and my phone writing this review 

dont make the same mistake i did play at your own risk

i am impressed with ascended the trees fall over and push the other trees around when you chop them down which is really cool when gathering the bushes for berries the bushes actually lose leaves first then stems and then the base the dinos also move brush and trees around when they walk this has already saved me from getting ambushed because i was paying attention to it

the building has been improved so much now i have 10k hours in the first ark but i quit long ago some of the items i mention here might have been introduced in the original ark but after i quit i rather doubt it some of the new hatches and hatchframes doors and doorframes and the roofs you also have several different building options for snapping and such its just wonderful i know this was in s mod but you can pick up things you place down without a mod in the first ark everyone complained about the different dino gate sizes in ascended ive only made the smallest of the gates so far but i noticed its taller than the small dino gate in the first ark i cant wait to see the others

the game is absolutely beautiful sorry if your pc is potato but mine runs this game like a dream the water is well done with the small waves hitting the beach and the small swirls of water that kinda look like rip currents when you swim up and come out of the water there are little droplets that go everywhere its so realistic the game is gorgeous

the clouds are even amazing i think i saw a shelf cloud come in as a storm was moving in at some point

the loot drops are way cooler looking the four legs that eject from the sides is a nice touch i really like the animation they make when they disappear or dissolve

the map is the same but much more detailed its as if the interaction with rocks and trees have changed they are more of an obstacle now or something

i am cant wait for aberration

when ark survival evolved released there were only a handful of dinos and they couldnt even walk backwards there was no doed or anky i remember running around grabbing stone by hand now we have this and im glad i had the pleasure of seeing the evolution of the game keep up the good work devs

#####

the fatal errors are real

#####

its getting better a little bit

#####

ark 15 basically

#####

honestly when asa was announced and it was decided to sell it again for full price i was under the assumption that the entire game was going to be overhauled graphically dinoscreatures included we know wc has new better creature models thanks to previews from ark 2 so why does asa just use the exact same models as ase

there are a ton of old dino models that could have used a major upgrade even by ases standards so i would have thought wildcard would use the opportunity of a full game remaster to upgrade the dino visuals too

but now the only real difference is for somenot all dinos a few small texture tweaks and lighting thats it

now compared to the hyperrealistic environment of asa the dinosand the mammals too honestly look extremely out of place

they look more like cartoony painted plastic toys than real living creatures and its extremely disappointing for a game that touted on about how awesome graphically and next gen it is there are games still running on ue4 that have far better dino models textures everything

take the isle for example if you were to compare the isles rex to arks arks rex looks downright goofy in comparison same with the carno pachy parasaur troodon basically every dino just looks cartoony and plastic they dont look authentic and they dont look like they even belong in their environment

for comparisons sake heres tis rex vs arks

httpspbstwimgcommediaf9y2dgxwcaaybaformatjpgnamemedium  ark

the isles models are far more natural looking and look like they could be realistic living creatures that would belong in a hyperrealistic environment

really disappointed we did not get any real improvements in dino visuals from asa hopefully it will come in an update at some point especially for something being resold at full price when its entire premise is this old game but it looks better now

ases dino models worked for ase bc the entire environment kind of matched in art style it was stylized enough that the dino models blended well enough but for asa the creatures dont match at all

i cant really recommend this game so far when its number one selling point isnt even completecreature visuals are untouched and without that its literally just the same game as ase with less content and less mods available if youve already bought and paid for ase as it stands it doesnt really feel entirely worth it to buy this game as well for full price

i enjoyed romping through this new version of the island more than i thought i would  i think overall they did a pretty good job with this remake  here are my thoughts

my specs
cpu i912900k
ram 32 gb 4800 mhz
gpu 6800xt
monitor 32 165 hz 1440p

the great
the view from ten thousand feet gives me the same ole island that ive been playing on for nearly 10 years  it has the same basic layout  the obelisks are right where they should be  all the biomes are the same  all the rivers and ponds are the same general shape and where they should be  the similarities pretty much stop there  the ue5 revamp visually is in the up close details of the island  the topography is vastly different once you get up close and is much much more detailed  its hard to even recognize where i am sometimes  the changes to the details are too many to list here and its definitely the standout change in the revamp  well done wc

the good
there at least a dozen quality of life changes to the game that i can think of but ill only name a few  tames can now be tracked on the map as well as the ui from the moment you start taming so youll never again lose track of where your tames are while taming or if a tame on autofollow gets lost  the ui tracker also has a neat torpiditytaming progress bar  shoulder tames can now have their inventories accessed via a command wheel without having to throw them on the ground  nice  player structures also got an overhaul  walls are now 30 taller this is just an eyeball guess  they also simplified structures by consolidating similar pieces  for example you can no longer build doorways or windows  you build a wall then change the wall to be a doorway or have a window  they also improved the way structures are placed and snap together  loot crates have finally had their drops revamped  they are now much more worth going for even at low levels

the meh
its still the same game as ark survival evolved ase  level up tame tames grind gear beat bosses  id assume pvp is the same too i dont pvp  i cant call this really good or bad its just the same ole same ole leaves me feeling kinda meh about it  once the veneer of ue5 wears off im unsure if the quality of life changes will be enough to keep me interested in a game ive ultimately already finished

the bad
bugs  this is a rather minor dig as all games have them on release but i feel it needs to be mentioned  ive had to use admin cheats twice to get my argy unstuck from some of the new geometry  it seems to happen to even wild argy as ive seen multiple wild argy stuck in the terrain  ive also had a handful of freezes and crashes to desktop  there also seems to be fewer dinos on the island though this just might be my experience  ive only seen 2 doedicurus over an entire weekend  im not sure all wild dinos were spread out properly

the ugly
not much to put here really  the game has had some optimization problems on launch  obviously this issue impacts people differently depending on system specs  there were multiple optimization patches over launch weekend that seemed to help out a lot  one problem ive had with my last gen system is i cant seem to get amd freesync to work properly so i have to deal with some occasional ugly screen tearing

overall id recommend the game to old and new players as long as you have a system that can keep up with ue5 on medium settings

#####

the game is a cash grab ark survival evolved is a far better game and now they have gone pay 2 win 

save your money

#####

theres a lot of talk on if this version is worth getting or not i mostly notice a lot of smaller changes and differences between evolved and ascended but overall those small changes add up to make it overall in my opinion more enjoyable

 they added baby dinos which are cute and easier to tame if you can take out the parents
 they took away electrical cablesoutlets and irrigation pipes to make it easier to hook up now you place a generator and it has a range that it will power when you place a water intake it will also have a range that you can connect a tap to
 a good amount of building pieces are now all in one and you select what you want to use as you place it for example all doors and windows are 1 piece a stone wall is also all door frames and the window frame pieces connect a lot easier and you can also shuffle through the different areas within range that the structure youre trying to place can connect to
 you can pick things up at any point on evolved you have a timer and once that time is up you have to destroy the item vs picking it up on ascended you can pick it up at any time even 5 months later


this is not all to mention but its a good amount to consider and overall i would say that if you enjoyed ark survival evolved a lot you will enjoy this one too just be sure to find a stable server because some of them are prone to crashing and other bugs as well i almost gave up because i thought it was a game error and it turned out it was just the server i was playing on now that i found a good server its incredibly enjoyable

#####

good game its a decent remaster not worth 45 usd imo bc it runs like dog water

#####

i can now heat my house with my pc for the winter

#####

are you kidding me its awesome the graphics are gorgeous the sounds are great the commands are prefilled haha the building features are fantastic its ark but better i absolutely love it even the character customization is better and no more robot hips when you hit trees give it a try you wont be sorry 

if you review this game and say that its trash just to appear edge lord to your internet pals then youre a bob who lives in a tool shed in his parents driveway whose only friend is the toddlers roblox plushie living in the plastic barbie playhouse in the neighbors backyardwho will never love you by the way so stop watching the poor toy in the shower weirdo

#####









#####

this was a big game for me and my stepdad but its honestly such a huge disappointment visually the game is stunning and thats majorly due to the transition to ue5 but the game performs like ass even on some higher end hardware which is a real shame considering this was supposed to be a step up in terms of performance and  
stability i understand the game is in early access and i hope they do continue to optimize the game i still feel greatly disappointed that after almost a year worth of delays we got a different version of ark that looks better has the same bugs worse performance and only one map at a 35 price tag
this is not a love letter
this is a disappointment
i hope some day i will have to come back to this review to put the game in a brighter light but until then i wouldnt recommend this game to anyone unless you have a lot of money to waste or love games that release half baked

#####

update  they did go back on the server hosting issue and that is now resolved after many fights from a dedicated community of players being very angry they are updating the little issues slowly and the game is much more playable now after many many updates there are still way too many trees in many places and terrain issues galore if you have the hardware and get it on sale by all means buy the game however i had to upgrade to a 4070 gpu just to stop the constant crashes that is insane
end update


i have never been so disappointed in my entire life the months of getting drip fed little asset images like trees sleeping bags and stone tools should have told us something the total radio silence right up to launch should have told us something too but despite it all we as a collective community of fans believed in the company that made our favourite game ark survival evolved is pretty great in its current form after all so surely a remake with better graphics bug fixes and features would be the best thing ever 
so when an amazing looking trailer drops followed by a game release in less than 24 hours we all jumped on the band wagon this is what we were waiting for right it looks amazing surely it will be amazing to experience well no not even close it is visually stunning and that is about it we trusted the developers when they said it was play tested and on track for release  either their playtesters were not ark players or they lied 

spawning in you get bombarded with the beauty of it all  those who can actually run the game that is as the recommended specifications on the steam page are a lie just like anything else that this studio seemingly says and dont get me wrong it looks great however after playing for a little bit you find out just what a mess this game is  early access is the tag that we all cling to as reason but honestly it is worse than i expected 
yes we as a community did hype ourselves up excitedly awaiting the game that was being dripfed and teased for months the developers just had to sit back and reap the rewards with minimal advertising effort as we were chomping at the bit for this game  and they did just that getting a little backlash from their community about not giving us anything at all to work with prior to release but shrugging it off with a promise that it would be worth it and we trusted them

my top issues with the physical gameplay are
the ui is clunky and feels outdated  the previous version wins hands down in that regard 
the dinosaur models sometimes feel out of place in their new surroundings as many of them are directly placed over from the previous game with very little to no updates to their models 
the game world does not play well in first person and many times you need to swap over to third person just to be able to see anything at all  the lush forest is way too dense to comfortably play in many spots and the terrain has multiple places that you cannot even access on foot without following what feels like a very liniar path  and i am not talking high cliffs but rather it seems like you can walk there but you get pushed away
traversing the map on a land dino is painful because of the overgrown forest and that is what has been bothering me most about gameplay
not being able to see the entire map is horrible as you cannot plan out a route that goes beyond the section that you are allowed to see at any given time no you cannot pan the map up and see the whole thing either they were so close to having a great thing going there with location marked pings and death markers   
the vanilla settings feel way off  just booting the game up not altering anything sees a character flying through levels without even needing to find an explorer note as xp gain is so high but you get one piece of flint from a rock or 2 pieces of meat from a creature and tweaking that is proving to be difficult to balance as the settings either dont stick or dont offer enough of a range of options i want vanilla asa to feel like vanilla ase and it doesnt
the handheld torches dont seem to make much light anymore and really do not help to actually see in the dark
the ambient sound is great especially in the caves and really add a lot to the immersive feel of the game but that makes the little sounds that feel out of place so much more bothersome using things mainly  i absolutely hate the laughable sound of hitting a rock  what happened to the old sound why does it sound like we are beating on glass give us a bit of bass or at least beat two rocks together to hear what that sounds like and come back to us
you need to manually save as you go and often too as this game just loves crashing on you 
even when saving often i have had my character engrams reset and lost progress more than once where the save just seemingly didnt work that is not fun we dont want that
and the crashing is intense  even with everything on my system updated and rebooted i still get crashed out of the game regularly which adds to the frustration my pc specs are posted below
why the hell can i not rebind the f11 key we already have a command for swapping window sizes it is altenter we dont need to use f11 for that i set f10 and f11 to my gamma up and down and by chance found out that this is a thing i was already annoyed so i am adding it to my list of annoyances
and let us not forget that its price has doubled in less than 24 hours with nothing to show for the increase 

and here is the big one
the greatest deal breaker for me is that this abomination of a game has done away with privately hosted server clusters  great communities were built on selfhosted servers where the physical hardware was in someones house it was promised to still have the option to do this way back when we were told how nitrado would have the monopoly on hosting servers i double checked it was in a community crunch 
but now after sales have rocketed up we find out this was yet another lie and we cant actually host our own servers  this forces players to play official those are full and having severe crashing issues and horrible ping for players who dont live close or rent a server from nitrado  not everyone lives in the usa i am not paying through my ears to host a server that gives me 300 ping  so what is left single player and nondedicated play with a 180m tether yeah that is great fun tried it out and ended up rage quitting the game as it comes with its own slew of irritations 

i am well aware that i am a nobody to the corporate machine just a voice in the pool of reviews and gripes  we all are but i fear that if studio wildcard doesnt get off their power trip high horse and take a step back to see that so many nobodies are unhappy about this game they are going to lose the battle 
get the private servers sorted and make a big announcement of that go with it was not added on release as we wanted to get the game in your hands first but say something beat off nitrado with a stick if you have to  you need to build communities not topple them like you have if you can do that they will be entertained enough while you listen to what is making players lose interest in the game we waited for and address that and this is the important part listen to your players we love your older game we expect more from you than this you have betrayed our trust many times over on this game turn back now and save this ship or get your life jackets ready 
i have no faith that this will actually be wildcards course of action and it will be a shame to see something with so much potential go down the drain 

my pc specs
rtx 4070 12 gig gpu upgraded from 3060 12gig at first review
64gig ddr 4 memory
i5 12600k cpu
gen4 2tb nvme to run the game from

#####

the fps in this game is very unstable even with  3060 u can get 20  80 fps on low setting and you guys should do something about people keep spamming foundation just to claim the whole area to them self in official server suck

#####

after waiting 12 hours after the launch trailer and going through multiple delays on the same day the game finally releases and it just doesnt run well at all im getting an average of 2030 frames on low compared to ase where i could get 6070 frames on max

not only does it run poorly the better ai and ui changes dont seem fully finished the ui is an exact copy of ase just slightly more polished and the ai just feels the same the only compliment i have for this game is that it looks really nice the map is a massive step up from anything weve seen and i hope as time passes they will make the game run better cope

im sorry for all the devs that went through a lot of crunch for this they dont deserve the hate that was spewed on the discord server

dinosaur thumb up

my favorite game ruined
snail games has completely ruined the upgraded ark through monetization of mods and more after wildcard has promised us everything would be a free update the new adventure packs are obviously meant to make money and still the fact they are taking some of the more popular mods and placing paywalls behinds them is disgusting i would rather deal with the original graphics of ase then deal with the upgrade that we got
i will see everyone when and if studio wildcard is getting bought by someone else because snail games are money slandering assholes

#####

here i will leave the cat friends who pass by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards

cant host own server
nitrado is dog poo company
refund imminent

#####

beautiful remaster  made me want to spent another few thousand hours in ark  

beware  i was able to tie most of my crashing to alt tabbing between programs  asa no like this  performance remained stable for the most part of i did not alt tab

#####

i mean we all know its wildcard but the optimisation on this is appalling
untested buggy mess

#####

sadly ill have to leave a negative review for this long awaited remake of ark survival evolved the performance issues questionable changes and scummy company practices makes me not able to in good faith recommend this game to anyone in its current state


first ill go over the pretty heavy negatives

 the performance issues are almost definitely the fault of rushed development most of this can be assumed to be the fault of the games publisher snail games usa which has made horrible business decisions for the developers and playerbase the past few years snail games has also made the mistake of giving nitrado exclusive server hosting rights for asa meaning that if you want to host an asa server youll only be able to get an nitrado one

 whilst the map looks graphically amazing the creatures feel like theyve been left in the dust their models and textures have been upgraded to higher resolutions however this was not enough in contrast to the other improvements

 somehow the worst change in my opinion is the new ui its absolutely abhorrent and feels way too much like a mobile game the color contrast and presentation is also a straight downgrade from evolved


and now for the postives

 the game is drop dead gorgeous if you have a powerful enough computer to run it at higher settings and i do mean a powerful computer

 the new main menu music is a bop gareth coker never fails to amaze me with his talent

 wild babies for the animals add more life to the world and are an interesting new way to acquire tames good to see them still look as derpy as ever

 the improved pathfinding for animals has also been a long time coming

 the new character creator and human animations are also a great improvement whilst keeping the ark character intact

 there are a bunch of new qol of life additions such as death markers massively improved building and a pinging system


in conclusion

this game needs to go back in the oven there are some great premises and ideas here but right now its a shell of what it could be given more time and a different publisher

#####

i like dinosaurs

#####

this is my very early review after 2 hours of playing on launch day
for now i would not recommend buying this game for following reasons

my specs are ryzen 5600x overclocked to 46ghz 32gb of ram a nice m2 drive and an rtx 3060ti gddr6x but still cant go past 2550fps ish on the medium settings so many frame drops and i didnt even fly yet the game crashes like crazy if you try and change the video settings takes a while to process the changes too

nostalgia is great but its really unfortunate that they didnt learn from past mistakes forcing some coding that would totally f things up id like to thank for the new ui too its almost the same but the changes are there and i couldnt let it slide and not tell that i actually liked it thats it for now might update it whenever they decide to fix things up

edit

do you have some time so here is my 125 hours experience into the game put into a steam review

ark survival ascended is a disappointing experience for new and old players on the franchise the lack of communication respect and honesty with the community built what we have today as one of the best yet acting dumb community of all the gaming industry

first of all the game does look insanely good if you have the computer to it which by the time im writing it means nobody runs this game the way its supposed to be played games do have this problem nowadays where instead of optimising the whole thing and letting players decide to utilise dlss fsr which this game doesnt even have yet and other technology to get even more frames without losing their quality they just dont mind optimising it

the game have a powerful engine that is ue5 it has potential but they released it like the game would run on the own engine you know the project before exporting it theres not a single config you will change that will boost your fps out of the blue keep in mind rvolumetriccloud 0 sure help but comes with a hit on the graphics instead you could change some settings to have less clouds if you know a little bit about the engine you know those settings exist you can get it working but what about the player that want to turn on the game and play oh that dude hes done buy a new vga i guess

the motion blur is tagged on and off by whichever setting you change low  off medium  off high  on epic  off  how about you let us decide to turn on or off such setting like it doesnt affect fps yeah surprise people motion blur does not affect the damn fps of your game its personal preference

the game still have stones floating around or under the ground invisible water in random places close to the water but not visible to the player the dinos do look amazing in epic texture  epic advanced settings by the way if you change it to high it will show the outside lights inside your house because of course it will

the amount of dedication the project must have gotten is insane and i do believe the game will get better but after around 20k arkse hours around 2k hours on this steam account thats my current one id say i do not expect it to get any better without heavy taxes specially graphically speaking the movement feels kinda clunky at times but still easily fixable probably the discrepancy in frametime is the reason i believe so myself it does not utilise more than 12gb ram at 1080p if you think thats the case please select ram per process on your third pary program and youll see youre wrong if you see higher numbers youre seeing the whole memory of the pc being used that includes 6gb for windows 11 for example plus background programs matter of fact id rarely see it going above 8gb that changes 12gb for 1440p and 17gb for 4k

my cpu as mentioned before ryzen 5600x goes to 3040 usage with the game  server running in the background ill go back to that in a minute

the new ways of dealing with construction feels kinda like s but without the pistol to get things from high above i loved the implementation of degrading items visuals and armors visuals depending on how much durability is still left nice touch the water reacting to everything is amazing but demanding too and the forest is just incredibly realistic but again most people specially the ones who will try and run the game with a bunch of console commands are not gonna see those details which is kinda sad since the whole point of the game releasing was to make ark look and feel better

about the crashes theyre gonna stop eventually from 125h i played around 16h straight without a drop then suddenly i played 30 min and crashed about 3 times on the next day its a code problem

the good point as i said about the nostalgia i always play with my friends i do config a server for us closed by password everybody enters and plays the game and we have a good time but i do a bunch outside of that playing by myself but what have i done lately besides fixing the game and trying to make it look good and work so i can actually play the game it feels like they dont want us to play the game just expecting to play it im honestly trying to be kind because i do know that there are people in love with this project and would do anything to see its success but theyre not the bosses are they

which takes me to the last part of my review they sold their game to snail games im not gonna take part in any conspiracy theories about the 13 bi or anything but another subject thats on the surface to be touched the control nitrado is trying to have over everything making us players have the option to put only one for now server to play so whenever the new maps release we cant put a cluster online huh its embarrassing if you offer a good service you dont need monopoly to control shit because people will go back to you services but no you guys can barely make your servers stable let out give ourselves good clusters with good configuration this if not changed by the near future will kill this game alone

you wanna play this game wait for the hype to go down and think properly bare in mind that you will need a great gig to play this with my specs i do get 60 fps on 1080p and dlss performance i just cant light a torch or else the fps will go to 20 my friend that helped me with reviewing this game played on her 4090 ti gig she couldnt believe the game would not maintain 60 fps constantly on native 1080p nor any other resolution unless dlssfg is utilised the game does feel good it does bring you back to arkse and it has great potential will they do anything about it only time can tell but for now if you really enjoy downloading a game clicking on play and playing for the sake of it i cannot recommend you that game

all that being said if you are one of the people who will play and need help with the fps and dont care even a bit about your graphics here are some interesting commands that work up to this day 110123

there are other things to change but honestly they wont help you any more than those btw if you see someone telling you to put a steam launch option do not the game wont run on d3d11 nor dx95 what the fuck how do you guys put two dx on the same command and expect it to do miracles

thanks for your time thanks for the game the people from wildcard and thanks to arkade for the free key
also bfuck you snail games and nitradob

#####

ive played ark survival evolved for thousands of hours and have played this game long enough to know it isnt worth the 45 price tag the graphics are only really achievable with top of the line hardware the servers are not good enough to handle the traffic and there are not enough of them so basically consider buying this game as a single player experience currently and even in single player the game it not well optimized and just feels sluggish compared to ase old ark i wouldnt recommend yet as i think the game has great potential but isnt currently worth it unless youre a hardcore player whos dying for something new

#####

rtx 3090 at 3440x1440 and lowmid settings barely playable with base dinos probably low settings will be only playable
thanks for letting me test it for free yikes lmao

#####

rip ark
murdered by snail games

#####

the pc needed to play this game hasnt yet been created


#####

oh my gosh  ignore the whiners  this is the most stunning game i have ever stuck my virtual toe in  i love love it  the colors the dynamic water the tiny babies wandering around  i am going crazy wanting to raise babies  mama persi is my name raising dinos is my game  i played ase starting soon after it hit steam and now im almost 67 years old and as i have said before i plan on playing ark as long as i can then ascend to the great ark in the sky  come on people keep on surviving and quit complaining

#####

stephen hawking runs better than this game

#####

i can tell this game will keep me warm this winter  instead of sitting near the fire it will be near the computer

#####

very bad release devs are so out of touch with there community need nasas hubble telescope to be able to run this game on low settngs just to  get 60fps servers are unplayable as its lagging 310 as a 10k hour veteran

#####

only cuz nitrado and their exclusive deal greedy remove tethering

#####

a group of players forced me into a corner and made a pair of triceratops fornicate on top of me and i was forced to watch the entire process they named the first born after me

#####

rtx 4090  i712700k  32gb of ddr5 ram  6000mhz

performance on all settings maxed is around 6080fps with dlss set to quality and frame generation turned on the problem is fg is implemented improperly you get horrible ghosting with it turned it on turning it off fixes the ghosting but cuts fps in half

the game is playable in its current state for high end pc users i however cannot recommend it until performance issues are addressed

things ive noticed
sun rays improperly shine through trees and looks fake and pixelated
ghosting with frame generation
trees in heavily forested areas of the game look fake 
you get minimal performance gains no matter what graphics settings you choose
wild dinosaurs feel less present 
fps drops in majority of places in map especially when looking different directions 
game crashes

i will keep the game under 2 hours of playtime so i can refund it if issues are not properly addressed rating negative for now and will update if things change

#####

wow the price just doubled

#####

game with a great amount of potential ruined by nitrado exclusivity and monopolistic practices

#####

rvolumetriccloud 0

i gained 50 frames when i disabled the fog

#####

i was a little nervous reading all of the other reviews but i havent had any problems i had some frame issues when i first started playing but 2 hours later i havent had any problems or any crashes thus far i have felt this was well worth the money for the upgrade

#####

10 fps low settings the worlds first demaster

#####

the supposed switch to a new game engine hasnt improved anything in fact its made things worse the game is riddled with performance issues

its clear that studio wild card is more interested in our wallets than our enjoyment
i used to be a dedicated fan but this moneygrabbing approach is a huge turnoff

if they have even a shred of shame they would have at least released an optimized game

#####

do not purchase this game it is just a money grab

#####

wildcard pls increase harvest speed solo be tough


#####

if you wanna buy a game and then stare at slot capped servers for a good few hours then boy o boy this the game for you 

also when you raise it to devs they just ignore you your tickets their discords etc 

none of the servers are playable as it stands constantly crashing every ten mins when you eventually get on to a server your stuck at 30fps 

wildcardsnail games should be tried for fraud 

dollie and ced literally couldnt fold a piece of paper

#####

the graphic overhaul is amazing get ready for it to fry your computer though even if you got crazy specs little frustrating its basically the same game just with better graphics

#####

i have flesh eating malaria

#####

fixed the crashes thanks

#####



























yeah i play this game at 22 fps on low so what

#####

i expected it to be bad but this blew past all of those expectations the entire point of this was to release a more optimized version of the game on ue5 this really was just a cash grab we should have all believed them when they told us thats what this was its really unfortunate because the visual updates are actually really nice the new building system and visual update for building pieces is great its just all overshadowed by how trash the rest of it is

#####

h1give it a month or two or threeh1

game released earlier than it should have and is in early access anyway

#####

made my high end setup feel like im playing on a intel graphics family again

#####

english 
lots of people are complaining about crashes and lack of optimization at launch it was horrible like when they released ark first of the name but theyre working on it and releasing frequent updatespatches from a crash every 510 minutes at launch now i just have 1 or 2 per day sometimes 
is the game worth the price yes fg yes i dont even have recognize the island the game is beautiful and devs have done a really nice job ive played ase 800hours im already 100hours in asa so yes its not fully perfect for now but it will be

français beaucoup de personnes se plaignent de crashs et de manque doptimisation au lancement cétait horrible comme la release du permier ark mais ils travaillent dessus et les màj et patchs sont fréquents de 1 crash toutes les 510 minutes au lancement je nen ai plus quun ou 2 par jour quand jen ai
estce que le jeu vaut lachat oui clairement oui le jeu est splendide je nai même pas reconnu la map island les devs ont vraiment fait un joli travail jai joué plus de 800 heures à ase jen suis déjà à plus de 100 sur asa alors oui le jeu nest pas encore parfait actuellement mais il le sera

setup informations

edit i forgot an information playing solo in pve 

hope my review will help some of you

#####

kinda playable now with a few crashes here and there but its improved alot also private servers now

#####

the game looks great but runs terrible even on a top of the line pc the game also crashes often loosing all save progress i would wait till this get sorted out

#####

do not recommend buying unless you have an extremely beefy pc runs terribly even with the lowest settings

#####

completly unoptimised garbage specs 4070ti 5800x3d both overclocked 32gigs 3600 ram and game runs like shit

i barely hit 50fps with medium settings without dlss and frame gen when i enable dlss without frame gen it removes 10 fps hello wildcard how does that work with frame gen and dlss i get about 70fps on medium game looks good tho but lighting is glitched and displays artifacts first person water doesnt display the water displacement under your body but 5m away and that all on regular basis 

oh and yea of course the good old crashes if i enable dlss and frame gen in the main menu and start a new world game crashes if i change dlss and frame gen at the same time ie toggeling both off game crashes if i traverse the map to fast game crashes its completly unoptimised and you actually need a 4090 if you want to make it playable kinda sad but honestly expected cant recommend the game rn unless you have a 4090 sad but true gonna refund it

#####

ark survival evolved is better

#####

1010 game my computer turned into a taliban freedom fighter and exploded would definitely reccommend

editjokes aside thes guys are nothing but greedy people who dont really care about the game copy pasting code from the old one to the new who dares call that a remaster

stay away please

my thoughts 

3112024

in my initial review i recommended this game as there were honestly some minor improvements over ase however my experiences were largely in sp since my review ive put more than 390 additional hours into asa and the honeymoon stage has worn off this game is a mess that has yet to be cleaned essentially asa is a reskinned revisted in some areas version of ase everything that was wrong in ase is more or less in asa the graphics as advertised which was a big selling point for many are impossible to achieve with good frames 60 without a 30804090 its disheartening when my 3060ti can barely maintain consolelevel frames as far as stability goes i kept crashing to desktop in sp and it was so frequent that it eventually lead me to quit playing for a time playing on a private unofficial server with a friend was even worse i would disconnect randomly sometimes less than a couple minutes apart and wouldnt be able to load back into the server without restarting the game a couple positive things i will say about asa is the loading times and building is much much better than ase if not for those improvements i probably wouldnt play if you must buy this game buy it on console  on sale performance is better on xbox

#####

id recommend but i wouldnt buy unless on sale or they release the center map date that they actually release the center on if you are planning on doing official you might have some trouble finding a good spot to build most the time people are willing to help though on pve to me its kind of a restart from ase if you didnt get the time to actually start out on ase official but imo if you want to do unofficial or just private servers ase might be the better choice lot less demanding and you can find a lot more decent ones a tiring thing is they keep putting all these dinosaurs on asa like okay cool but how about we focus on the other mapsid recommend the game but its definitely more of a neutral thumbs up just barely sticking a bit positive anyone who has at least 200300 hours in this game with a negative vote have a pretty good reasoning on why they are upset but you cant really take anyone who has less than 200 hours with any real source of salt i doubt theyve done the boss fights or spent the time prepping for them

#####

still early days but so far so good looks stunningly beautiful and with some configuring of the settings i am pulling good frames with my 4090 i assume they will fix the issues soon though maybe i will sink 17k hrs into this one too

#####

unoptimised hot garbage 4080 constant lag rubber banding frame drops vsync not working this is single player on medium preset btw

im very unbiased when it comes to my reviews regardless that i hate most devs wildcard and snail games are the worst companies in gaming period

video is false advertising only one map currently the island

visuals are nice but not worth rebuying this once promised free game 

ill revisit this review in a few months if theres some updates but as of now this is a flop and im probably going to get a refund save your money buy ark survival evolved instead

edit 1 first few update a few more frames but constant official server crashes if you plan on playing official its exactly like playing gen 2

edit 2 smoother servers less crashing official still loaded with toxic people its slowly on its way to changing my review well see how the weekend traffic goes and update this edit

edit 3 friday 5pm est  monday 11pm est same time zones for whatever official servers youre on dont expect to play much during these times

edit 4 constantly crashing ill get to play 10 minutes then the whole game crashes this is new and only started since last update i love waiting 50 minutes to join a server oh the new queuing system doesnt work or it only works on consoles and was implemented to slow down pc joining

edit 5 solo or rent a server its the only way the game is fun

#####

we was promised private servers we could host on own own dedi its now been confirmed this is not the case nitrado have full rights to the licences you  can apply if you have a large community so no thank you but on a plus note game was running fine for me

#####

i hate it but cant stop playing it it helps me get over hard times of my life

#####

i cant recommend this in its current state
tldr it has same bugs as ase at this point more crashes and worse performance cool graphics and nice promises tho

i got more than 6k hrs on ase and 400 hrs in asa and heres my take
the good
 better graphics
 easier mod handling for users
 tons of cool promises
 thousands of hours of replayability
 better ai pathing than ase
 improved dinos utilities  oviraptor dung beetle etc 
 good gameplay loop survive  build  hunt  raise  kill  ascend
 fantastic building system

the bad
 bad stability expect crashes in thick foliage depending on graphics inventories engrams menu
 low performance all the new and juicy stuff is eating at your fps like crazy especially the volumetric fog clouds and thick foliage
 exactly the same bugs as ase eggs dropping through the floor dinos get stuck in mesh
 poor singleplayer experience you need to tweak a ton to manage it solo or in 2 to 5 players in a reasonable amount of time dinos are not spawning reliably  even with prevent hibernation  etc
 terrible changes to cryopods
 developers prioritise adding content over fixes why
 monopoly over private dedicated server rentals seriously get the out of nitrados hands
 unnecessary rng layering to prolong playtime
 useless loot drops

for those that took time to read this and played ase before  dont bother yet let them release at least scorched earth and make the island playable youre not missing much

#####

asa is good but i think that a lot of people are bored of the island they need to get more maps in

#####

looks beautiful but if you read this and want to play check the requirements it crashed my 3000 dollar laptop in 10 minutes on medium graphics settings

#####

quickest refund request ive ever submitted

#####

there is no nice or respectful way to put this its unoptimised and just truly awful in the way that it runs on the pc like i had super high hopes for ark considering i have over 2000 hours on evolved but the game is crumbling unless you have a 15k pc setup with jet engines as coolers praying for optimisation and more than just island as a map

#####

dinosaur

#####

05 stars

direct port of ase same bugs same lag same bs only we took away 7 years of progress with qol changes and such all the excuses about engine limitations are no longer applicable cause we are in unreal5 now this is 100 a developer failure steam should not allow these games to sit in early access for a decade make them fix their shit or pull it off the market

#####

this game is absolutely garbage the development team is terrible the studio is garbage please whoever reads this save your time and money on this garbage

#####

 released way too early game is actively being fixed

#####

with the recent updates my 3060 doesnt want to unalive anymore its for sure a beautiful game and has huge potential it is a remaster but it brings along many things that werent there in ase so what changed besides the graphics building got a major overhaul new structure options better and new snap points and reduced engrams so one engram counts for multiple structures baby dinos with them comes the option of adopting them by either finding an orphan in the wild or make them an orphan ui overhaul cleaner and simpler ui making it less in your face durability is now visible on your items when you hold them instead of just the health bar drops got much better better ai path finding no movement speed which makes surviving a bit more challenging since you cant just speed past a raptor some cry and say it is bad but i see no issue with it i enjoy that i cant outrun everything anymore which made me much more aware of the beauty and danger that can lurk in the dense foliage which now moves if something brushes past it i still havent seen everything but i really enjoy it that said if you hop on just for multiplayer wait a bit longer and keep yourself updated many bugs and network issues are still holding the game down but every new update so far made the good game underneath more a reality if you were planning on singleplayer buy it play with the graphics settings and enjoy the new ark 

note this game is not finished yet and even though ase is now 8 years old asa isnt and the code is a bit different from the original game the game will receive all maps through updates at 0 cost furthermore new story maps have been confirmed so the crying about why it costs 40 bucks is easily explained by the addition of those new story maps and that you get all previous maps whether or not you had the dlcs in ase it basically will be its own new game and is already different from ase and the differences will just get more the more we get other maps and new or overhauled mechanics

ps dont rent nitrado servers they dont deserve any money

#####

need a 2000 pc to be able to run the game knowing that overall only 5 of people that bought this game do not have reach to those numbers you should have considered optimizing it at least so the performance can be 150 or 200 better that it is right now

run ark ase at epic settings in 70fps  run ark asa in lowest settings for 30fps

all the things you presumed to have nanite shadows bush movement will need to be removed in order for at least 50 of people to play the game properly

and here we were paying 40 and waiting for months i will try get my refund if possible

try fix your game for the 100th time

#####

the best thing studio wildcard can do from here on is selling their ip this studio is very very clearly incapable of creating any game if you really love your fans sell your franchise leave it to people that are good at what theyre doing this game in its current state is an absolute joke refunded immediately

#####

they reversed the server hosting which is great what a mess that was we have our community server up and running which is super exciting

the graphics look great and im glad to get to play again with lots of small changes to make the play experience even better 

you do need to tweak the graphic settings as expected its fairly intensive on the video card but if you liked the original ark you will like this providing your pc can handle it

still lots of visual bugs to fix and stability but they will come changing my review to recommend

i look forward to the future maps and hopefully a better experience over time

#####

okay i loved the original i put in over 2k hrs on my single player game alone so i was excited when a heard it was getting a face lift after i got my new pc with a 4090 i was more than disappointed to get 60 fps i needed to run it in potato modeand in full 4k settings i maxed out at 30 fps dont buy it yet hopefully the devs polish it up some more and it gets better ill try again then

#####

no hosting your own unofficial dedicated servers game will be refunded after review end statement fuck wildcard now official end statement  we the people have won dedicated servers are free for all to host

#####

i have a ryzen 9 7900x radeon rx7900xtx 110fps on low 55 on medium 40 fps on high 30 on epic artifacting occurs every other minute texture bugs are plentiful especially low poly issues plenty of clipping issues hotbar breaking sometimes the lighting randomly makes it day time during the night vram issues possibly a memory leak etc i could list every bug i encountered today and it be a document 8 pages long but simply put ark survival ascended missed the mark in multiple ways outside of bugs you have pretty visuals until you look at the fine detail to realize some things feel very out of place i took plenty of screenshots item icons are the same assets ai updates seem not to exist at all dynamic animations dont exist with dinos glitching into meshes  each other and flying too high causes you to die maybe a bug but could be a feature i still have some hope that the game could age like fine wine being that its currently early access but i honestly am having some trust issues with this release its going to take a lot of polish and bug fixing before i can give this a good recommendation ive been an ark player since 2016 so i know the pain of bugs but as a person spending 40 on this game i feel like i paid for a half baked product i cant help but think theres a reason the trailer was posted on the same day as the games release 
ill update my review when wildcard cleans the mess but for now its getting a 2510 if you are running anything below an 80 class gpu youre running on low settings or not at all play evolved instead or wait patiently i loved playing ark survival evolved and currently think its one of the best survival games out there but this game still needs a lot of work to be done before i can call it a better version of evolved

#####

dont waste your money clunky messy remake that will take time to get functional 
also do not purchase if you want to play on your own or friends private servers since that is locked down by nitrasho

#####

20 fps lets gooooo

#####

essentially unplayable unless you own a 40 series

#####

im preserving the below as it may come up again and players should realize the type of company theyre going to have to deal with if they buy this game  the nitrado deal still really stinks theyre the worst private server hosting company that exists  but they did back down on self hosting  theyve made patches and fixed memory leaks on servers i havent had any actual issues in game running a 2080 super and an i7 8700 with 32gb ddr4 ram  for now changing to positive 

in true wildcardsnail fashion its not even the game thats the issue which dont get me wrong there are plenty of in game issues just look at the other reviews   
theyve done everything in their power to piss players off 
first they promised the game would be free then bundled it then not  we got over it but still a crappy move  
then private servers were what made ark survival  playable   theyve all but killed the ability to host a server cluster yourself and gave nitrado of all companies exclusivity for private hosting  theyd be one of my last choices for a choice like this  forcing dedicated communities to shift their servers to an unpopular option is not the way to make your player base happy 
add all that to the secretive nature of this launch tells me they knew people would be pissed and hid it so people would buy it as soon as it came out before discovering the layers of crap they shoveled on 

hoping the above changes or will likely be refunding

#####

well in ase i have about 14000 hours playtime with 2 accounts and on asa im about 900 hours the graphics gameplay and map is improven well its ark with its best look you love it or you hate it

#####

rx 6700 xt

25 fps on 75 resolution scale and medium settings

#####

devs still havent figured out how to optimize a game
releasing paid dlc for this dogfart game is scummy 
get evolved instead of this

#####

a week ago i was diagnosed with a terminal illness and the doctors have given me a year at best im so glad i was able to play this before i go i dont know how many people will see this but i recommend to you to play this game if you do see it gameplay atmosphere graphics everything is masterfully crafted if you read it thank you and good bye

#####

this is 100 a scam first of all wildcard just copy pasted the game from ark survival evolved upgraded the unreal engine version and called it a day the ui is roughly the same the mods are now inferior starting from scratch vs 30000 mods on ark survival evolved and there is a price tag to boot running at 40 fps on medium settings with an rtx 3080 this just screams obvious cash grab

i just dont get why this wasnt released as a free update for the supporters of the original game even with the 10 launch the game seemed unfinished sure this may feel like a more finished version of ark its just left with a bunch of new strings attached like a server hosting exclusivity agreement and a new modding platform the original game wasnt beyond repair i just dont understand how steam would allow yet another early access copy paste of this through

its really sad the state of affairs we are in when games like this get hyped up and people get conned into buying them

vote with your wallet support developers that release new content or games that are what they are advertised as

#####

i was very excited for this but also prepared for disappointment and was given both 

for one the game looks incredible the graphics are absolutely beautiful it feels so much more alive with how the map was reworked 
but in bad news the specs are way underestimated running on a 4070ti ive had a few lag issues and im not able to play with friends due to the specs being way higher than they state i hope that in the future they optimise this better like they did with asa but for now i cant recommend it until thats fixed unreal engine 5 is supposed to give support for higher end graphics to lower end specs and this did not give that i think there is potential and i believe this game will become amazing but i wish i didnt have to say that right now its disappointing wait until future updates to purchase 3

#####

cyberpunk maxed out with path tracing runs better 1440p high settings with a 4090 and  7950x3d and it was playable but not pleasant good luck to the console release

#####

warning requires nasa computer to run
here is my specs

graphics card

using the information what fps do you think i get is it 100 200 its 1020 fps with 60 fps on low settings but even with low settings i get constant lag putting me to 6 fps randomly and on low settings it looks worse than ark 1 i would much rather just play ark 1 as i can handle that with 300 fps on highest settings 








#####

this sht is about as stable as michael j fox in a bounce house drinking a slurpee

#####

h1 ark is back h1

whoever played ark back in 2015 knows what it feels like to play ark ascended at release just like its predecessor this game brings a lot of challenge fun and frustration to you 

starting by the graphics its not even fair to compare ark evolved to ark ascended because the graphic discrepancy is so insane between the two this game uses the most beautiful engine available in the market right now and it makes use of the best graphic and optimization technologies available to us right now such as ray tracing dlss and frame generation unfortunately having such an engine has cost us a lot because the overall optimization of this game sucks tremendously hopefully they are going to fix this as soon as possible personally i think its insane that a user with rtx 4090 and a 5800x3d can barely run this above 60 frames in 2023 its just out of the question

regarding mechanics all i can say is that this game takes what made ark great and mixes it with a lot of the mods the community made for us throughout the years the result is that we have an experience much more fluid than before with lots of new mechanics and systems the fact that we are going to get all the dlcs along with new content in the next patches makes it even better if they can apply the same level of quality to the content we already have to the upcoming content then i dare to say we might get one of the best survival games ever made

gareth coker is the composer of this game and i cant say much else about the soundtrack other that its absolutely fucking awesome the guy is a genius but then again this is no secret ark soundtrack has always been top tier even on the first game and this game reuses a lot of them

finally yes this game has a shit ton of bugs game breaking bugs graphical glitches progression exploits all the nasty stuff youd expect from a halfbaked game this is why its called early access hopefully they fix these too

yes i am an ark fanboy 

h1 before buying this game be aware  that it will consume your life because you will get addicted to it h1

#####

you cannot host your own server off your machine and play on it at the same time

some people say you can set steam to offline mode after starting the server and you can play but to have to go through loops just to play on your own fucking server is disgusting im disappointed

#####

please dont buy this game or any expansion  the developers make promises that they dont keep all of the classic legacy ark evolved bugs are now part of the game again the player experience is worse than it was before they remastered the game content is lacking players are returning to original ark evolved with all the maps because it is better than this trash remake cash grab  the developers dont police the game cheaters are everywhere and they are not being banned  the ark official discord however youll get banned within minutes for complaining  if they policed the game servers as hard as the discord ark ascended might actually be competitive fair and fun to play as of now the game is trash and will remain trash probably forever

#####

                                             









 
ah shit here we go again

#####

every 60 seconds 10 seconds pass in an ark survival ascended official server

#####

im amazed that i spent like 3500 hours in the original game knew it was a buggy piece of trash still dropped 60 on this assuming that itd be a buggy piece of trash and am shocked to find that it is actually a buggy piece of trash

the power of delusion

#####

nitrado serves are better than your servers but now we gonna get charged for it good job devs

#####

3080 ti 
12900 k 
32 gb ram 3600 
nvme gen 4

low settings hd 80 fps
epic settings 2k 612 fps 
medium set 45 fps

the problem is the cpu and gpu usage is under 35 all the time no matter which setting i use  i dont have bottleneck

#####

dislike for changing the price

#####

having a toxic lovehate relationship with this game i love the game but the game does not love me

#####

please stop repeating the same mistakes as before stop vomiting out content to dig into our pockets for more money and actually focus on fixing your brokenass game

#####

frames are dogshit even with a 3070 and you cant join any goddamn servers crashed once i managed to finally join only to never be able to get back into that same server 
other servers will say 4870 and still not allow you in 
cash grab if i ever saw one a pity since i have over 7k hours in the original ark 
ill update my review if anything changes but knowing wildcard snail games now i doubt it

edit lag has improved somewhat and new servers were added helping server load the usual bugs were added along with it though

#####

no fps 100 servers for 60k players  ass game

#####

fix these fucking dog shit crashes cant play a game i payed for



#####

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvvaivlmhozw

#####

got 2000 hours in the original ark so i really love the game but i just barely got 60 fps when everything is on low and dlss on i7 12700k and an overclocked 3070 ti in the remake no support for self hosted dedicated servers

refunded


maybe ill will buy again when the game doesnt need a supercomputer and were able to host our private games ourself

#####

having dedicated over 4000 hours to its predecessor ase ark survival ascended felt like a promising upgrade when it was first teased however the reality is a stark disappointment despite having some qualityoflife improvements over ase this better version seems rushed and incomplete for those invested in official servers the experience is marred by developers seemingly turning a blind eye to player issues the state of the official servers is a joke high ping rubberbanding and crashes on top of that it is an open playground for cheaters  dupers unanswered tickets for weeks resulting in server rollbacks this shows a clear lack of care for they have a players real life invested time  unoptimized mess of a game only focused on making more money through false promises and microtransactions soon  although snail games seems to be the real villain behind the scene wildcard really needs to work on their communication and should start being truthful to the community 

at this point in time this one feels less like an upgrade and more like a hurried cash grab failing to meet the expectations of many

#####

despite what they claimed in the publicity this is actually a harry potter balenciaga level ai generated retexture and senseless reskin of ui with a 60au price tag on it you could find the same results from mods in the workshop with better optimization 

perhaps if snail games  werent wasting money trying to incriminate angela games of stealing code wasting money at the casinos and on doge coin  they wouldnt find themselves in financial deficit selling their morality and retextured tricks for a quick buck 

i cannot recommend this game to anyone 

the short scenes with good fps they programmed for the cinematic looks nice 

if this was a free optimisation package for ase  which we were owed when the game went live then i could recommend it

early access review single player prospective

to start the game is early access there be bugs
the game also instead of what i call an import into from original ark into unreal 5
the games share a lot of similarity and thats where that ends
also the requirements for the game are a lot higher then original ark

maps have been rebuilt theres a lot of details that where not there compared to the original ark 
mountains are exactly what youd expect they are hilly and rocky and mining metal with out a flyer will take you some time
they are not like the past version where you could get  to every node with a anky and be fine
grass now exist and good luck trying to find that death bag or small dino you knocked out with out a lawn mower

caves fallow the same  they are in the same locations but and fallow the same map if drawn but  traverse completely different

the sea has been redone completely though you will not beable to view it all due to fog unless you turn it off

will i recomend the game to people eh the game is fun and looks greatbut there are some things you need to know before you get into this

one wild card cant keep a  schedule no matter how much they promise they either over promise or put in things late for approval to both pcconsole so things get delayed dont look at the road map and  expect the game or dlc to be out when they original said it will not happen

all events at least at current time of this post are  mods you need to download this is a good and a bad change but is what it is i guess

#####

it was what i expected great graphics but slow start with crashes and optimization could be better but i still think this game is worth it and the devs have been every few hours releasing patches and i can easily see within a month that most bugs an crashes will have been fixed by then

#####

totally worth it i love it after almost one hour graphics testing and tweaking now all is good everything running smoothly and im ready to start my island jorney

have fun in the game survivors

pros not taking up half my hardrive space currently
looks better
cons gotta turn off all the pretty feautres cause even with a 3080ti those clouds and light bloom murder the frames hard
just prettier

#####

i have completely lost faith in the developers i am aware that i have a large amount of playtime but i did that on the understanding that the game would be updated and content would improve first this was announced as a free update nope 40 fine support the devs at least all the classic maps would be dropped at launch nope tricked me twice only the island crossplay with xbox right away nope not if you used mods then they announced adventure packs which is the wildest pay to win microtransactions i have ever heard of the first purchasable dino revives dead dinosaurs and is a walking mountain you can build a base on there are even rumors it will be able to fly this means every pvp server will be dominated by bases at the roof of the map in corners in theory this could be really cool in practice wildcard hasnt figured out how to make boats that function yet every map has now been delayed for like the fifth time the community voted dinosaurs arent coming the way they were promised im tired boss i just cant justify this anymore they told me i would be getting a nice slice of wagyu steak and then they brought out some old bologna that they wrote the word  stake on with sharpie buy hell divers and protect democracy or palworld and fight against it dont buy this game until they release what they said they would i have been playing ark since the beta and this makes me super sad

#####

this game is fun until you play online servers are garbage play if you ready to lose your hours of progress in just few seconds and the worst optimized game i ve ever seen worse than cities 2

#####

refunding due to no self hosting

i have dumped tons of hours into ase with my friends  we self hosted on our own servers that ran rock solid with site redundancy internet redundancy  we played the game for 8 years and finally beat it last year  my tribe of 8 was very excited to play the new unreal engine 5 remake of this game  

however we soon realized the true agenda snail games was hiding from us  we thought their post before the game released about allowing self hosted meant we would be able to have our own private servers that we manage the equipment for  unfortunately that doesnt seem to be the case

apparently you need to have at least 10000 active members in your community in order to apply to get a dedicated server license  

snail games i would say this is unbelievable but i shouldve known you would pull this  at least have the decency to address these questions when the community is straight out asking you about them

ive never refunded a game before on steam but this will be the first for me  it pains me because ark has gave me and my friends so many great memories but ill not fall victim to their greed for moneyforcing us to nitrado  

fix your mistake snail games or youre going to get a lot more refunds very soon

#####

its aight totally not biased

#####

purchased the game and was hoping to spin up a small community server as had been outlined by the developer prior however it seems they changed the way they handle multiplayer installing the server files didnt work which required me to install the steam client on my server box and then when i ran it it logged me out of my game copy  this is so totally disconnected from what they had done in the past my wife and i ended up refunding both of our copies as well as the one we eventually had to purchase for the server  until the developers and nitrado the new overlords of ark can figure out how not to screw the community over its best leaving this alone nitrado had just loaned a ton of money to the developer in exchange for a cut of all sales sadly companies wont learn that this behavior to their fanbase is bad unless it hurts them in the pocketbook

#####

bring gportal back nitrado sucks

#####

its far from great

its supposed to be a rebuilt from the ground up version of ark survival evolved ase but in actuality its the very old switch ported version that was converted to ue5 with a replaced texturemodel of the raptor to make it look like there was a huge improvement but 90 of its just the same old stuff 

ue5 is more demanding than ue4 so no shock it runs worse but its quite a lot worse while other ue5 games seem to be no where near as bad

then on top of this the content the really lacking content it just makes it feel pointless to throwing to many hours at the game to just do the same thing you did in ase honestly i feel like ase is still the ultimate version sure they used to say the reason for many bugs was the unreal engine limitations but now theyre on a newer engine and they dont just have the same bugs but extra bugs and crashes maybe once they added more content and seriously patched up the issues and improved performance my opinion will change but thats certainly not my case currently

i cant recommend buying it if you feel the want to get this game youre better throwing money at ase and playing this much more fleshed out and stable version of the game and sure the looks might be slightly behind this version but itll push the limits of even strong machines when playing a well built up save

tldr asa feels like a pointless money grab just get ase

#####

horrible optimization dont care if its early access 40 for this should be considered a warcrime a 4070ti paired with a ryzen 7 7800x3d struggles to run the game at 1440p mid settings which look disgusting as well without dlss3 there is no point in playing it dont waste your money wait at least a few weeks and see if they improved it by then maybe new drivers will also help but dont expect anything too crazy very unfortunate   if it doesnt get a whole lot better within the next 13 days thats a refund

#####

compared to  ase it is stunning and while there are still issues at least it is heading in the right direction 
however making us pay nearly 40 for a game that i already owned just with a few upgrades is disgusting
if i have to pay for dlcs again i think it will be a sad day and i will have to say good bye to one of may favourite janky games

wildcard need to stop chopping and changing what they are doing and just give the fans what they want and have been asking for

#####

yes you might need a 4080 or higher to play with almost maxed setting getting around 35 to 75 fps but the game does look amazing and the game just came out today meaning there is sooo much room for updates and fixes honestly they did alot better job with this release than i thought game is probaly the most beautifulest game currently

#####

i have a pretty lowmid tier pc if you actually take the time to go through and customize your graphics settings properly it runs pretty damn well ive got a somewhat steady 4560 fps going and im running under reccomended specs in some areas

#####

it got the updates it needed

#####

 meshing still exists
 terrible ai still exists
 chinese cheating megatribes that crash the server for forced rollbacks everytime something bad happens to them in pvp still exist
 horrible performance issues still exist
 speedhackers on argies flying around the map at mach 7 still exist 
 terribly outdated models for many dinos still exist
 constant server crashes still exist
 meshing still exists 

dont buy this game fuck wildcard fuck snail games


#####

i cannot recommend this game for two main reasons firstly it suffers from very poor optimisation secondly theres currently an exclusivity agreement for server hosting in place with a single company nitrado which seems extremely anticonsumer to me 

ill be open to updating this review if either of these situations improve if youre reading reviews and contemplating purchasing this game i strongly advise you to wait until the situation changes

edit since my initial review several optimisation patches have been released while frame rate has improved the game remains poorly optimised for reference i have an rtx 3080 and ryzen 5900x setup and i struggle to maintain 1440p 60fps on mostly medium settings 

the more significant issue is that the game still crashes to desktop frequently making it essential to save frequently in single player mode to avoid significant progress loss

the anticonsumer server hosting exclusivity remains in place

#####

i only played a very short time however i will say i had no tech issues running the game on an rtx 3090 only played single player and the improvements to the game that i noticed over ase are all good i like the graphics the animations the lighting charactor models and so on

however the reason i stopped playing was because i decided to get a refund on the game once i found out the situation with nitrado and their exclusive rights deal for hosting servers i realized me and my friends who have always played together on a private server would have to purchase a server from nitrado i knew we wouldnt be able to play so i bailed while a refund was still possible 

nitrado spellcheck can charge literally anything they want with no competition they can charge you one thing now then next week raise the price if they choose a lack of competing options in server hosting is a bad thing for everyone so i think i will stick to ase

edit
after the recent update removing the drm lockout of drdicated servers and thus allowing dedicated private servers now i decided to rebuy and give it another shot ill play a bit more and update the review accordingly later
