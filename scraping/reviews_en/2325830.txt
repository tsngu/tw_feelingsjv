the simplest way i can explain this fiasco to someone outside is like this

imagine you go to a burger joint your usual good ol cheeseburger with fries for 12 then over time the patty gets smaller theres one less slice of cheese and all the while the price goes up most people are irked but dont really care because its what we love and while diminished doesnt take away from its core enjoyment 

then one day management promises that a quality shift of produce is underway and that is why they are doing another pricehike sure more for better so why not until the day comes and their entire improvement involves adding more salt to your fries increasing the amount of dipping sauce for said fries and putting a cute flag on your burger all for a whopping 13 increase and a further size reduction to your patty almost all the changes were a net negative so someone complains and then the boss says all these improvements to your meal costed us dearly so if you cant accept these changes well have no choice but to stop serving this meal forever
you can guess how that went

the point is the price hike is merely the tipping point of a beloved franchise given almost no help made worse with their bosss words more or less confirming that they sat on it the whole time then demanded more for doing so much and the only way i can tell you this is by buying the damn dlc

#####

shadows of change is a disappointment from top to bottom whether it is the price increase to that of a fully fleshed out race pack for only a few new units and a few legendary lords the numerous bugs both unfixed and newly introduced or the tonedeaf statement from ca that says buy it or we will pull support it is hard to find many things redeeming about this dlc

you can tell the changeling was the lord that received the most care and attention as detailed later many of cathays reworked mechanics are either lackluster or do not work as intended as a lord yuan bo also has several issues denoted in the bugs section 

kislev is missing ungol units and replaced them with units that in lore have no connection to kislev furthermore we have no lore of hags as a magic type or hag lord so your armies are being led by boyars instead of the proper lord truly a missed opportunity in my opinion the kislev rework is also very disappointing and does not deal with many of the underlying endemic issues that kislev deals with as a faction why does the new lord start in dark elf territory this is not explained either and is not loreful

several of the units in this premium dlc also feel like paytowin one of the big surprises from the dlc launch announcement is that ca has multiple playtesters if ca does have an actual qa team how come the bugs listed below is so extensive 

new maps dont work

yuan bo cant hit single entities and sometimes gets stuck in dragon form

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0qxbkeastow

the cockatrice had the attack move bug ca has said this has been fixed many times with other units

the new battle ai has been lobotomized

rice paddy maps still lowering fps despite being fixed

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvclzgdakkatk

kairos still has the old changing of the ways on his skill line beastmen red line skills do not enhance their new units the new war drum unit also has issues with its animations i could go on

these are just the bugs we know about right now who knows what else we will find

all in all this dlc is a disappointment i have bought every dlc and game up to this point ca and i will not be purchasing any more dlcs games or other products from you further 

what tww3 needs is a custodian team to give regular meaningful fixes to the game in between dlcs and proper funding to the development team so that the content matches the price my opinion of the game is that it is stagnating and not getting better 

even one of tww3 greatest supporters is tired of your bs

ca please listen to your community and do better you are rapidly losing all the goodwill this community has given you all these years i am predicting pharaoh and especially hyenas will not do well please focus your attention on your one profitable product

alright i gave this dlc a fair shot before im making this review so keep that in mind this isnt just me hopping on the bandwagon
this dlc is pathetic
when you buy this dlc you get three figures the changeling yuan bo and mother ostankya as characters theyre all pretty decent and pretty strong but i bought this dlc for the campaigns not for the characters the campaigns showcase
the changelings campaign is a chooseyourownadventure and while i didnt personally get interested in the premise i get theres probably some people who liked it it seems to be well enough made so ill give a neutral opinion on that
mother ostankya is a copypasted grom the paunch with the roster of those malevolent tree folks interesting premise terrible execution in realms of chaos shes not too terrible but her campaign is relatively flavorless but immortal empires i dont care what excuses other people come up with having a figure whose entire lore background is drawing on the power of the land of kislev above all else not start in kislev is just sad that and her hexes dont affect autoresolve her recruitment is stunted by lack of units and streamlined by just how op the ambushers are compared to everyone else and her gamelong goal is just too grindy with nowhere near enough flavor
and finally yuan bo i did a full realms of chaos campaign with this guy
heres the breakdown
 2 cutscenes one at the start and one at the end with copypasted art in the first one and a single scene in the second one
 no required quest battles other than the final
 the final quest battle is a normal siege battle against a single lizardmen army braindead easy
 no campaign completion reward aside from knowing you completed the campaign unlike most other realms of chaos nations
 no fundamental change in the unite cathay and then kick chaos in the groin experience the other cathayan lords have
 fundamentally the experience of the campaign was just a lite version of warhammer 2s great vortex campaign
i hate to talk this much crap because i love the total war warhammer series but the appropriate pricing for this dlc is 10 tops i needed to try it out just to see for myself but for those out there who dont feel that brand loyalty need steer clear this one is not for you sorry

#####

edit theyve now updated the pack to include several new units for each included race and a lore of magic and this is now much more compelling at their asking price it shouldve been closer to this in the first place when the price was raised but people refusing to accept less for more and the company updating the pack to fix that is the kind of thing i wish we saw more of

#####

units released by dlcs some examples
champions of chaos  64 units previously not in the game  25
chaos dwarfs  51  25
tomb kings  54  19
grim and the grave  32  10

shadows of change  28  25

ive played total war since medieval 1 ive played the warhammer trilogy since its inception ive bought this dlc and all prior ones because ive supported this game series do not buy this dlc at full price as it is not worth what they provided for the cost they are charging this would need substantial lateadditions to be worth this price 

shame on you sega shame on you ca devs youre cool and i know this is the marketing and management failing you

#####

more money less content chaos corrupts ca it must be purged

ca if youre going to fk me at least take me out for dinner first

the right to a positive review is a privilegeit is not an entitlement you earn by making the game

edit

i think its still too expensive its the same as the chaos dwarf faction which was a perfect dlc aside from the bugs and being a little too pricey as well happy to see the update but i still do not recommend this dlc

#####

the right to a positive review is a privilegeit is not an entitlement you earn by making a overpriced dlc

dont buy this until its 75 off thats what the original price shouldve been

guess what positive reviews are the real privilege

#####

im a great believer in redemption so after writing a negative review when it came out i think its fair to rereview this dlc 

theres no way to sugar coat it this was a disaster on launch the resulting pr fallout from this was probably one of the major contributing factors to total war pharaoh being dead on arrival it had such a dismal content to price ratio that ea were looking on in well i doubt those soulless husks can actually feel disgust but there was at least some twitching in the death masks that they call faces it was a very very underwhelming affair that had slightly more content than a regular lord pack but was the same price as the already slightly steep chorfs dlc from earlier in the year and also completely lacked even the most token flc or updates 

 for a game that has been plagued by issues since launch it was somewhat vexing to the audience and when a ca exec turned around and lashed out at the customers needless to say that the biological waste matter hit the air conditioning since then its come to light that sega cancelled a ca project that they had sank approx 100 million into layoffs and chaos behind the scenes as well as the entire gaming industry suffering shrinkage now people arent in lockdown and gaming all day any more i find im a little more sympathetic although that still doesnt make the original offering any more worth buying or a certain execs bare faced display of contempt for the customer any less brazen but ca have apologised and added a good chunk of flc so lets review this in a new light

firstly right out of the gate it does not contain that executives head on a pike 010

jokes aside we had three legendary lords who now each come with a legendary hero a generic lord and a generic hero and the accompanying units have gone from 3 to 5 everyone got at least two monsters as well as other accompanying stuff and in honesty i dont have many complaints in this department  a lot of the original content whilst sparse was quite nice the monsters in particular and the added content from the update make it a pretty fantastic set of additions cathay now has flying monsters kislev has an icy luck dragon and tzeentch has flamers on hover discs for only two units extra it really makes the dlc rosters feel a lot more exciting the added lords and heroes are also really nice the tzeentch ones absolutely steal the show in the visuals department cathay has been begging for a melee hero since launch and its really nice they finally got one although i think the druzhina was my favourite a hybrid lord that can refresh ammo is endlessly useful for a faction as range heavy as kislev even the less impressive units like the kislevite warriors and centigors of tzeentch were both significantly better than i initially gave them credit for on this side of things i dont really have many complaints beyond the fact that the golden knights pauldrons look a bit silly oversized pauldrons from james workshop never and the centigors could have looked a bit more mutated

on the wider gameplay though i have to admit im still left somewhat wanting ca have upped the rate of hotfixes to near fortnightly theyve done some good work on sieges in the interim but theres still many issues that havent really been addressed yuan bo feels like hes just an upgraded version of the regular cathay campaign so makes his siblings very jealous but they cant go green with envy because hes already green and hell just laugh at them and exile them to live with grimgor the changelings campaign is still near impossible to loose and mother os starting position is horrendous shes supposed to be the protector of kislev yet starts in alabama fighting elves and kislev is often a sea of ashes before she gets anywhere near those aside the lords are fine i think my issues are more with wider campaign problems and bugs

to list the ones i find most prevalent recently kislevs base campaign mechanics are boring  and both kislev and tzeentch have somewhat weak economies and tech trees and a weird limit on their recruitment slots they only have base 2 and can only get more by building a higher tier building which can make actually recruiting an army an annoyingly slow process compared to some other factions especially in the early game the cockatrice should also be in the beastmen roster and isnt for some reason the gate bug is seemingly never going to be fixed and ive even noticed a new variation on it recently where entities can get knocked through into the wall when the gate pops open trapping them and their entire unit in place until either they all die or the battle ends your troops will still consistently favour ladders and and towers over wall breaches and gates and this can make actually getting troops inside a walled settlement incredibly frustrating the campaign map ai is extremely cowardly and is often more interested in running away from you than fighting it seems to always be just beyond your movement range and will give you the runaround for ages then start destroying minor settlements the moment you give up it almost never will actually attempt to defend one of its own settlements or attack a major one of yours unless it has truly overwhelming force and sadly you almost never see a large scale siege with multiple stacks due to this unless you are on the loosing side facing truly impossible odds i really miss it from older total wars where they would attack your settlements pretty much regardless so you got a lot more defensive sieges that didnt feel hopeless although walls will ever feel like an irrelevance until the ass ladders are removed  race updates usually come with dlc and its quite disappointing to see ca drop the ball on this twice although the update focus was clearly more on adding flashy content for the apology tour i very much hope they keep up with the hotfixes and keep squashing bugs as we all know the only good bug is a dead bug would you like to know more

ultimately up to you personally whether you think its worth it or not its still a bit steep but i can stomach it far more easily than it was before maybe a 25 sale

#####

h1 lets look at this in an unbiased a way as possible then well evaluate it from a biased perspective h1

unbiased

at 79 per new legendary lord the dollartoentertainment value is still justifiable however that assumes you will playbenefit from their existence 79 hours each the average campaign lasts many dozens of hours unless you lose which is unlikely as there are difficulties for every kind of player

so then what are the positives

the dlc appears to be more balanced than some previous entries with interesting new mechanics for at least two of the new lords that dont feel entirely pasted from another existing faction notably the changeling is a very entertaining new way to play with almost every mechanic at least feeling brand new and fresh

what are the negatives

the price is notably higher and will require you to find great enjoyment out of more things for a longer amount of time to justify it i was able to get this at a discounted price and can justify what i spent but for many they cannot this is understandable additionally it cant help but be observed mother ostankya and yuan bo suffer from a seemingly large lack of inspiration when it comes to uniquity and gameplay to compound off the price in order to justify the increase these lords should have all been bringing to the table what the changeling did or at least two of them should have with one being somewhat less inspired

why do i not recommend this

the price as is stated in the previous segment there is not enough brought to the table here at 15 i would suggest picking this up as that is a great price for what you are getting

what about an biased review

the asinine attempt of ca to threaten the tww community that almost unanimously carries their company on its back is mindblowing it is as if negotiations failed with gw and they know they wont be able to make future entries in the 40k series or aos two universes that would work as it requires a setting where running at another army in melee does in fact work when the other army has a gun line and they decided to gut the community for all the money they had left while they still could

this reminds me of daschcon if you know what i mean you are a scholar

#####

the content is fun but the price is an insult they charge the same amount for this lord pack as they did for the much anticipated and content rich chaos dwarfs race pack never before across the previous two titles did a lord pack cost as much as a race pack the management that greenlit this price and saw it as a savvy business move made a horrible mistake 

this dlc as a result of its absurd price has seen the lowest returning player player counts as all previous warhammer 2 dlc releases and has caused the base game to get review bombed and it is deserved this level of corporate greed should be called out and publicly be shamed i just feel bad for the actual talent that was put into this content just for upper management to ruin it for short term gains i hope ca has learned their lesson

#####

ive supported ca and the total war series owning nearly every game since 2000 i love these games love the theme and the depth however with the total war warhammer games they have turned a corner where profitability is far more important to them than their player base proof

the right to discuss is a privilegeit is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game  cas pr department

they issued an apology fck that show us prove it until then im not purchasing another ca product


#####

at launch this dlc was a huge money grab way overpriced for the content added i will go over what was wrong with it and why it is no longer a bad deal

for context other lord packs contained 2 lords and a small host of new units and the lord pack would be priced at approximately 10  12 dollars
this lord pack at launch contained 3 lords and a small host of new units the lord pack was priced at 30 dollars to simplify the math that is about 3x the price for 15x the content

after 8 months they have now effectively doubled the amount of content in this lord pack evening out the price differential to be 3x the price for 3x the content and as such the dlc is now worth the price

thank you to the developers for working hard to right a wrong and make it up to your playerbase

#####

corporates greed is out of control you shouldnt support this behavior

#####

so overall i would have to say this dlc isnt worth the full price tag and my recommendation is to wait until it goes on deal to at least 30 off or higher

short form the content involved in the dlc is actually quite enjoyable especially if you favour one of the three factions involved however with the content available to all three factions and including the freebie buffs to cathay and kislev bug fixes and improvements and the free addition of aekold hellbrass i dont feel this is worth the price of 1999 gbp and would encourage you to wait until its either in line with the same price as champions of chaos 1299 gbp or lower

long form an interesting change to the lord pack content for ca  originally we would obtain one good ll one average ll and one bad ll with one of the three being released alongside as free content this was a nice love letter for the community as it allowed people to pay for two lords and a bunch of additional units whilst the third often not coming with units would be given for free to the community as it didnt require the dlc to be useable or required you to hit download on a free dlc pack in steams menu

instead being released as part of the pack means the third lord now comes with units but is no longer available to everyone for free a mixed bag and overall feels a little weak but i said interesting because unlike old released lord packs i dont feel theres a loser here

mother ostankya adds a very interesting and enjoyable change to the kislev playstyle through a unique perspective of groms cauldron map based hexes that function similarly to eshin schemes and a wonderfully different starting position that has kislev going up against new and interesting adversaries that arnt usually available quite as quickly as before i would have liked to have seen the addition of a themebased lord like a hag witch lord or perhaps something like an akshina captain instead of more boyars or ice witches this was the ll i was looking forward to the most and i enjoyed what i got

yuan bo feels like the biggest winner here in my book taking the original cathay style of play and improving it by having four new directions to the compass for more interesting buffs and the stone and steel commandments add a very fun albeit also very strong layer to his gameplay his start in lustria feels nice but as someone who has used sea lanes early on with zhao ming to do something similar in the past this isnt completely new to me and wowd me less

the changeling is where it gets really interesting again whilst his overall playstyle isnt for me as im someone who enjoys painting the map in my colour the changeling having his unique stance on subverting areas and his unique theatres of war mechanic allowing him to play his own game makes for a very nice change of pace instead of a typical paint the map style which is something i believe offers a lot of value in the long run

this alongside a plethora of new units that bring both subtle and major shifts to their respective factions sounds like its a good review overall right 

the issue here is that we used to recieve this level of love and content for the price of 799 gbp whilst inflation has obviously risen and pricing will have to change to reflect that i feel its important to note we have already recieved a hefty price increase with the champions of chaos dlc available at 1299 gbp with that dlc we recieved minimal content as part of the dlc which seemed to be aimed more towards quality of life for multiple factions units but alongside that we also recieved for free a phenomenal rework to the warriors of chaos faction which in my opinion is what made that dlc worth the price despite not being actually part of the dlc sold

the free content released to everyone alongside shadows of change however i would only describe as minimal and for a major patch i would also consider it lacklustre 

the chaos dwarfs dlc priced at the same price as this one 1999 gbp involved completely new and interesting additions of an entirely new faction reworks absorption and improvements of old mechanics into a brilliant new system and a whole litany of new units with unique designs mechanics and gameplay that remains very fun

this despite being the same price falls quite short of the same level as set by its price overall i believe people purchasing this will enjoy it for the new additions even if they do feel like they make some older units more obsolete but the price does not reflect the full content in my opinion

thanks for reading

#####

lets compare twisted and the twilight was 10 for three legendary lords two legendary heroes including flc not counting drycha and around ten units depending how you count generic lords and heroes it came with an amazing new lab mechanic for clan moulder and a subpar system for the sisters which was later fixed shadows of change is 25 has three lords two heroes including flc and can be charitably described as having around 13 units the store page itself only claims to have eleven it came with reskinned mechanics for ostankya a powerful mechanic for yuan bo and supposedly overpowered mechanics for the changeling havent gotten to his campaign yet for one last comparison forge of the chaos dwarfs was 25 came with three lords two heroes 1 flc and around 26 units now i was annoyed when chorfs came out because the race packs of the past all had four lords but when compared with soc theres no question which is the better value
so thats my standard for you ca if youre charging me 25 i expect at least 25 new units not counting variants nor rors by my new metric for your dlc soc was barely worth 15 and i will not make the mistake of being overcharged again i only caved and bought this because cathay kislev and tzeentch are three of my favorite races i dont care about empire dwarves or nurgle enough to get thrones of decay unless it matches my dollarperunit standard
by the way im not the only one who noticed that youve risen the price on some of your older games and dlc did you really think the community was going to let you get away with that sincerely how do you expect us to recommend your games to new players when you keep jerking the price up even for your older content youve clearly been taking the wrong lessons from paradox and dont think im letting them off the hook im just about to go review tours and tournaments very harshly
i guarantee you if things keep going this way strategy gaming is going to die as an industry ive been having more fun with free games on steam recently ive been hearing nothing but good things about baldurs gate iii but instead i spent my birthday cash on this i was hesitant because of the very long early access period it went through but im veteran of the series and if gaming companies keep going the eablizzard path of the industry baldurs gate iii will be the last game i ever buy

#####

i will no longer be purchasing any and all ca products for the following reasons

1 there is no feasible reason to raise your dlcs to almost a quarter the price of the base game
2 the lackluster performance of this particular dlc youre turning this franchise into some mindless content mill
3 the utterly despicable reaction youve had to your only audience voicing very valid concerns considering all the wiggle room weve given you from the day this game was announced

i invite any other ca and tw fans to do the same as well as not to support or sign up for their impending shooter hyenas until their overall behavior and attitude towards us and our criticisms change they should receive no further support we are not banks for you to sap money from we are not the idiots you seem to think we all are we are not free advertisement we are not beta testers for you you need to change your attitude and reevaluate how you treat us as well as your goals for dlc and content because this and all the tumultuous events surrounding this dlc is unacceptable absolutely unacceptable

#####

overpriced op lords that can never lose op units locked behind paywall  paytowin multiplayer matches these are the worst times of total war and this is the symptom of rot festering in ca brand department 

fire rob bartholomew

#####

ridiculously high price for a couple of lords which is apparently worth half the price of the full game dont be me dont buy this unless they reduce the price dont support this shitty game practise

#####

for the next dlc do you also want a drop of blood from my firstborn too

#####

next dlc be like

one ll

one new hero

two new units which are actually same one just different color

14999

#####

ca 
to my dismay
you have lost your way 
you have turned your success 
into a greedy parlay 

your fans wish to stay
dont make them overpay
to win their hearts each day
let fairness lead the way

in this game of relay
principles shouldnt stray
remember the initial display
and bring back the old ca

for in the end come what may
trust built can easily decay
hold onto values come what may
and watch fans rejoice in the ray

#####

you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain

#####

i dont often review much of what i purchase hell i dont often even question my purchases for total war warhammer much but ive come to realise this was probably the tipping point

theres not much else to say regarding the dlc that hasnt already been said

i would recommend this game and the dlc for it every time i was ever talking to a friend about this game getting myself the new dlcs day one even getting my friends a copy too just because i wanted to support it but i cant play ignorant of whats been happening for a while now 

i cannot in good conscience recommend this dlc or even the game anymore bugs design issues balancing dlc pricing and obvious pay to win sometimes has cost ca my faith and most likely my money in future purchases

#####

overpriced underdelivered

patch 42 edit
the changes ca have made to this dlc in patch 42 have changed my opinion the quality of shadows of change has increased dramatically and i would now say that it is absolutely worth its 25 pricetag 

that said i will leave my old review below for posteritys sake

launch review
this dlc isnt necessarily bad but it is definitely lacking in content when compared to a lot of the past releases definitely not worth 25

#####

i got this for free and i still feel robbed

#####

the right to discuss is a privilegeit is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game

#####

h1 patch 42 edit 22nd feb 2024 h1

i am so happy to see these new content additions to the dlc and have to admit they went above and beyond what i expected them to all the 42 additions are fantastic and seems very community driven as its pretty much fills the holes the dlc had that the community brought to attention

so first  i want to give a big big hand to the community for coming together and sending a very clear signal to ca and making them realize that this game and its community is something to be treasured and not ignored kudos everyone

secondly  i want to give a big hand to ca for coming around and taking a deep look at themselves and admit that they made a mistake this is the beginning of the redemption arc  stay the course ca and your fans will be with you

there are some other things i would have liked to see like a rework for the older kislev lls faction mechanics but in theory  those are not really related to the dlc but i do hope we see those free rework in the future

for me  soc had some really fun narrative campaign and faction mechanics but the roster was so lackluster and patch 42 absolutely fixes that issue for me so im happy to give it a good review now that being said  we shouldnt forget what has been  so im leaving up what i wrote in my old review as a reminder

do i recommend this dlc now yes do i think its worth 25 euros on the edge for sure if you can find it for 20 euros then for sure  id recommend it without hesitation

h1 original review h1

so this is a sad day as its the first day im writing up a negative review for any of the total war warhammer content i have enjoyed through the years i will preface this that im not giving the dlc a negative review to help protest the new business policy or make any sort of statement i will explain all the points good and bad and will explain why its a negative experience for me so without further ado lets get into the review

h1 the good h1

i prefer starting with the good aspects of the dlc and facts are  there are a lot of good bits to this dlc

list
 really cool and engaging legendary lords the lord options in this dlc are fantastic  yuan bo mother ostanyka and changeling are all really cool legendary lords in their lore and unit gameplay balanced eeeeh but fun and cool looking yeah
 incredible faction mechanics the factions mechanics have been dialed up to eleven here and boy are they fun from the schemes of the changeling to the court works of yuan bo as well as the powerful hexes of mother ostankya  dang these mechanics are a lot of fun i think my one concern here is that they make other lls in those faction a lot more tedious comparatively speaking  and the fact is the faction reworks were pretty minor this time around so it makes it hard for the older lls to compare to the new toys
 narrative campaigns in ie yesyes i am so happy we got narrative campaigns for ie as well as roc i hope they keep doing this for the future as its the best way to enjoy a campaign in my opinion unless you just want to paint the map which is a viable way to play as well still
 amazing centerpiece units the centerpiece units are of fantastic quality if they are lacking in quantity the units and animations are just top notch and i cant fault the quality of the few units we got and on that note lets move on to
list

h1 the bad h1

list
 too few lordsheroesunits for a premium dlc they really didnt go hard with the unit roster unfortunately the most scathing part of this is the lack of a thematic lord for kislev which almost entirely ruins one of the factions the dlc is for imagine playing mother ostankya and not being able to have thematic leaders for their armies if you are someone like me who prefer playing thematically this will pretty much ruin the hag faction for you its such a glaring omission that i have a hard time understanding how they could possibly elect not to have added it with the dlc
beyond the lack of a thematic hag lord option the dlc should also add a cathayan hero if these were added i would be tempted to rate the dlc mixed if that was an option hell  i would even consider making it a positive review with caveat warnings
now what would however make the dlc a good value in my eyes is if they added hag lord or akshin or ungol lord for kislev hero for cathay a tzangor lord andor hero for tzeentch along with some unit variants akshin dual wielding melee variant tzangor javelin variant and a celestial dragonguard great weapon variant

and honestly  thats the bad of the dlc only focusing on the dlc content here not the rework or flc content but the issue is that its so bad it drags down the entire dlc

im not going to argue that the high price is a bad aspect of the dlc just simply because a high price  bad review i dont think thats the case if the dlc content is worth the asking price then im fine with it unfortunately  this dlc is very light on the unit roster aspect and it hurts the dlc so much

sure there are a few new bugs introduced but ca has since then focused on doing more hotfixes and have been ironing bugs out more frequently finally so even though thats a good change  its not something i include in my review as i review the dlc and its content for what it brings and bug fixes reworks and flc i separate from the dlc

that said  i will quickly mention that the reworks and flc this time around have been pretty minimal and though i really like the changes to harmony this is a mixed bag as a lot of people dislike it as well  so far from people ive talked to about it its been halfhalf between the likes and dislikes of the new harmony system there wasnt much done beyond that in short  the reworked factions are still in need of a rework which is a shame because who knows when we will get that again

tldr  is the dlc worth 25 euros no though it has great lords great faction mechanics and fantastic centerpiece units and animations the fact is that the unit roster is just so severely lacking it just drags the dlc value down hard

these dlcs are the times we have a chance to fill out those generic lord and hero slots and when they dont do that it means its ages until next time we have a chance of that happening and not getting those generic lords and heroes really hamper a faction and the gameplay experience those factions provide

#####

essentially you are paying 25 for 3 new lords of all ready existing races a couple new units for said races and somewhat unique campaign mechanics for each lord

while i do enjoy the new content it is a mystery to me how ca came up with a 25 price tag for such small additions to the game in its current state i would call it 10 at best

for the price they are charging i would expect a major updateoverhaul for cathay kislev and tzeentch at 25 i would think to get at least 2 new lords per included race at least half a dozen or more new units per race and perhaps most needed new and more hero unitsagents especially for cathay 

if this dlc made major improvements to all 3 races i would say maybe worth it at 25 but still feels like a stretch at that price ca has announced they will be adding in more content to this pack i will update this review if they follow through and make it better for now do not buy any higher than 50 off

#####

i have bought every dlc for the warhammer franchise  not likely to make that mistake again

#####

the right to discuss is a privilege  it is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game  cas pr department

the right to a positive review is a privilege  it is not an entitlement you earn by making a overpriced dlc me and every other player
i bought this dlc for 15 bucks on that amount or less i think it is worth it otherwise give it a pass

#####

even when you receive this dlc as a gift its still too expensive

#####

the dlc is hugely overpriced 
no generic lord and hero for tzeench and also 1 generic for kislev and cathay when the faction needs both
the amount of new units is also rediculous  3 for each faction
faction rework is mere cosmetic
ca menagement blackmailing the community if this is not bought for its price  they stop making dlc
the pace of bugfixing is rediculous slow


the game is in the end of its cycle and ca is trying to squeeze last morcel out of it blackmailing the community and not fixing bugs presented in previous dlcs and even reported longlong ago just ignoring those issues

#####

this is the first time i have ever felt compelled to write a review for a videogame let alone a dlc i love this franchise and love the work that ca have put into building not only a game but a community i foresee myself playing this game into my 90s should i be blessed to life that long but i am deeply disappointed by this dlc especially its price and its content the individual lords are fine enough but the lack of cohesion gameplay dynamics units bug fixes and evolution leaves me feeling like this was the sum of 3 flc lords combined to form one overpriced mess moreover given the community response and the general drop in player interest i am very concerned that this community will not get to see this trilogy in its entirety

ca needs to remember that it is their hard work alone that has revitalised the oldhammer community and have given one of the most realised fantasy universes in fiction its long dormant fanbase back along with new fans it is total war warhammer alone that gave gamesworkshop the slap in the face it needed to breathe new life into the old world and it would be nothing but a travesty to allow the tww trilogy to wither on the vine

i sincerely hope that this absolute drop in every core element of goodwill can and will be addressed in months to come

you all have done so well to keep up the support and value of the products you have given us please keep that good work up


#####

overpriced ca is just trying to milk the community

#####

not enough content to justify 3595 aud

our costs are up  guess what ca everyones costs are up

#####

im turning my review to positive based on the news releases of whats coming to the back half of this dlc if those positive news blogs turn out to be smoke and mirrors ill turn the review back

#####

they are finally listening and i appreciate that

#####

i bought this on sale after ca promised to add more content

i thought it was going to be bad but yikes they are going to have to at least double the content to make this worth it

so terrible 

theres design decisions ostankya in naggaroth chaos creatures for kislev the changeling campaign being impossible to lose another dragon sibling thats the same as the others apart from being ridiculously op that are mindblowingly stupid

and the obviously cut corners wheres the lore of hags hag witches dont get any mount options because that would have been some effort in fact theres a lack of mount options for the celestial general too the janky war drum chicken hut was cut it was supposed to have come with reworks that didnt turn up

then theres the actual units christ so few units that offer so little in terms of new playstyles the kislev chaos creatures and sniper crossbows are just plain embarrassing tzeentch didnt need another mid tier infantry unit and cathay got furies but better because you paid for them and beastmen who already had the easiest most challenge free campaigns in the whole game got stronger

oh and one generic hero and one generic lord

they tried to charge us 20 for this

seriously dont buy it wait to see what they add because itll have to be very substantial to make this anywhere near worth the money

#####

i should have trusted the reviews 20 quid for 9 units and 3 lords 3 units a piece if i could get a refund i would hell im that mad im thinking of uninstalling the game

#####

the right to discuss is a privilegeit is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game  cas pr department

blow it out your ass creative assembly and sega i hope that 20 was worth it for you because it is the last either of you will ever get from me again and believe me i will stick to that just ask cod and many others i havent purchased a cod game in years and wont i have every tw game released and all dlc for them all as well i cannot even say how many sega games i have purchased surely in the hundreds since the genesis days but this was my last so id recommend you find a way to make that final 20 last you for some time to come

if it was just a pricing issue and they later saw the error of their ways and admitted as much i would have considered making future purchases but with their comments to their community they have shown a level of arrogance and lunatic ignorance that was it clearly written to destroy their own company because no company in their right mind would ever say such stupid things so it goes toward their obvious goal of committing harikari well allow me to assist them with that feel free to borrow my chainsword

#####

the base game is 60 comprises of 7 races 11 legendary lords and multitudes of units this dlc comprises of 3 legendary lords 1 legendary hero yay and 9 new units for almost half the price of the base game not enough content for this price complete ripoff

#####

feb 2024 update despite ca adding more content im not changing my review let it be witness to events that unfolded and serve as reminder that with enough drive the community can force a corporate to examine and change ironic in the name shadows of change became the change for ca it is better with all the new content lets just see it carry through to the next dlcs

 its so underwhelming that even my disappointment is disappointed

ca ironically called their next dlc thrones of decay to subliminally forewarn us of the state of their company and the warhammer 3 

pretty much the nail in the coffin for me for cas future endeavours wont even bother with other total war games going forward

#####

i dont mind 25bucks but the content is not worth that price 12 at max

#####

apart from insanely fun changelings campaign it is threequartersbaked with half the content of chaos dwarfs race pack for about the same price is it that bad nah is it good nope is it any good unlikely

so a quick summary
 tricksters campaign
 new cathayan and kislevite faction mechanics are okay enough
strike new units are welcome but they are needed in the base game and for base races not just via dlcstrike
 new units are welcome and more were added thanks to a free update to the dlc pack
 the yinyang revision seems to be a fine retouch
 tzeentch as a whole got a downgrade no halt faction or extremely useful reveal faction intentions anymore
strike as you may have guessed it the new dlc pack is bugged for example the changelings scheme concerning athel loren when you try to sackraze different regions of athel loren the game fails to recognise that you already did or a grand cathay scheme that gets cancelled because snikch conquered all cathayan regions which shows them as razed to you and it automatically fails the schemestrike
 bugs are present despite that the dev team seems hellbent on fixing them even if they reintroduce old ones sometimes
strike no lore of hagsstrike
 new lore of the hag
strike no hag mothers a generic hag lord there are hag heroes yet no hag lords strangelystrike
 no hag mothers instead there is a new lord type druzhina
 no chickenlegged hut mount for mother ostankyas faction katarin got a sled instead
strike no new cathayan hero type at least there is a new lord typestrike
 a new cathayan generic hero choice gate master
 barely any new regiments of renown

fun 810 nerfed tzeentch no true cathay or kislev rework ie no additional mechanics
contentprice 410
refinement 710

total 6310 
soso cant recommend since ca refused to unblock me on facebook reverse the ban before the backlash after pointing out that the game was a buggy mess and making fun of their unfunny greenskinnapoleon or tw empire crossover vid

updated 20022024

#####

overpriced

#####

the price isnt justified by any means you can buy an entire game for this price instead you get the value of half a dlc

#####

its not that the content is bad its more that you can get more from a free mod on workshop than you get for 25 from ca  i feel like theres a disconnect here

#####

h1total war warhammer iii  shadows of changeh1
another dlc this time giving us 3 new legendary lords the changeling yuan bo and mother ostankya plus some new units and unique mechanics for each of these factions
h1the changeling  aekold helbrassh1
probably the best faction in this dlc we get a new ll who thanks to his powers allows you to transform into any important character in the game of course we first have to defeat them in battle or do a mission related to them by the way one thing that pissed me off is that ca stubbornly refuses to give us playable factions with red duke and boris todbringer even though they have their own portraits here coming back to the main topic the mechanics are interesting and allow for an unlimited amount of experimentation the new ll itself is also quite strong in his true form on the campaign map we act as a horde and instead of conquering cities we create secret cults in them that allow us to secretly recruit spread corruption and steal the earnings of the original owner this is a more extensive version of the underground skaven empire mechanic a good addition here is also a more narrative style of play pushing us to perform specific missions that throw factions around the world of warhammer fantasy into quite a bit of chaos well except for the empire which gets weaker with each dlc and in this case it is no different they are all dead around the turn 30 moving on to the legendary heroes we got the blue scribe unit and aekold helbrass baekold helbrassb is a meleefocused lh which is true to lore after all he is potentially the best swordsman in the warhammer fantasy universe what weakens him however are the animations instead of using his blade like someone with a brain aekold prefers to swing his sword in the air like a jedi which destroys the reputation of his abilities and makes him quite weak since the animations are quite buggy and slow and ending with the new units there are far too few of them and they are not the best not to mention that one of them is just a reskin of an already existing beastman unit really creative ca
h1yuan boh1
the jade dragon is one of the strongest lords in the game he is a very strong mage and warriorr who can completely dominate the broken diplomacy system in this game however his gameplay is as wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle his unique mechanics are nothing special its just a regular panel where we choose bonuses spend a special resource on the bonus and thats it his faction has potential but aside from that one mechanic theres nothing to do here other than color the map green so i got really bored after a while especially since the game kept forcing me to fight the lizardmen all the time and thats where the problem lies because ca decided to squeeze the jade dragon into the already cramped lustria and the game doesnt even try to explain it this is a really strange decision and i dont like it oh and caravans and compass are still crappy mechanics but at least they fixed the harmony system a bit coming to units yuan bo is very strong and i dont believe that anyone has ever tried to balancetest him in this dlc because he is able to solo every other lord in the game mostly because of his abilities well almost everyone the fact that his dragon form is incredibly bugged doesnt help as for the units for a faction with a very large roster there are very few of them and apart from the lions they are not interesting the lions themselves come in two types one type emits magic the other blocks it and i really like their design and animations
h1mother ostankyah1
i really dont know what they were thinking while creating this factionmother ostankyas faction begins its campaign by startiing next to morathis dark elves and as before the game has the most standard and empty explanation for it mother ostankya is basically a weaker and much less known clone of baba yaga so i dont see why it couldnt be baba yaga instead she also doesnt have lore of hags because ca was too lazy to add one to the game so she just uses ice and shadow magic can recruit ice witches and since for some reason she doesnt even have unique generals she can only recruit boyars which is really stupid and awkward its as if ca finished modeling her unit and then just gave up and pushed her character somewhere randomly on the map oh and she cant recruit normal kislev units only forest wild animals and while it goes with the theme of her faction it doesnt help at all in the later stages of this campaign if anyone is curious in order to unlock normal units you have to go halfway across the world to kislev take over one of the larger cities or make an alliance with one of the factions there good luck even the mechanics of this ll are just a slightly recolored version of groms cauldron mechanic but here instead of food we have magical artifactsspirit essence finishing with the units their design is very good and they are strong by themselves but i have to add something except the fact that again there are too few of these fucking units but fuck it for some reason ca decided to ignore the lore and push the chaosbeastmen beasts into the kislev roster and while the beastmen got the unit as well it can be an annoying thing for more hardcore fans
h1price and cas responseh1
ca just turned into paradox right before our eyes we now have to pay a cosmic amount of money almost half the price of the base game while getting much less content a lot of bugs and here is the fact that ca doesnt even fix the old ones which sooner or later results in destabilization of every campaign the content we got here is worth maybe 7 theres not enough of it and when we see what they added its just obvious that none of the developers even tried and they just shit out these factions randomly on the campaign map without thinking repainted a few things and thats all really annoying and disappointing and ending with cas answer you didnt explain anything you were just trying to cover yourself up with a brainless excuse that oh no prices went up and we had to raise prices or our massively funded development company would sink to the bottom of the fucking void even if that were true the painful truth is that as a consumer i dont give a shit all i care about is getting a lot of good content at a good price make good dlc and games and the money will flow right into your account by itself the best example of this is the huge success of baldurs gate 3 ca doesnt do it because they either dont want to or the only thing they care about is money and after all of that shit ca you still have the audacity threatening me that if you dont give us money we will stop supporting warhammer 3 fuck you i really feel sorry for the people who sit on the front lines and despite their best efforts they are being swamped by terrible politics and rules made by people from the management
h1summaryh1
a dlc with potential that has been crushed by laziness and greed looking at the price and even the content itself its definitely not worth any money over the price tag of 7 if it continues like this warhammer 3 will join troy and other newer total war games in the graveyard
httpsyoutubero4kbcpcxzmsis7j1euj_n_r6r9_d

#####

shadows of cringe

about 500 solid worth of dlc content right here

#####

expensive for what you get the content is good but not good enough to justify the price

#####

dont be too mean guys
ca is just a small indie game developer as you can see
they only have 4 dev working on this fucking dlc
small family business please understand and support yes yes

#####

please note i got this for free through a giveaway

for the price its being sold at i cannot recommend it  if it were closer to being matched to the value of past lord packs thered be a chance id mark this positively but as is its definitely not worth it

tzeentch
the changeling himself is very fun and i like his campaign mechanics  hes not challenging in the slightest since in a full campaign i didnt lose a single trickster cult even one that was spawning hostile armies because i was smart about what else i built there but the idea of being a super trickster is intact and very fun the blue scribes are absurdly op  the tzaangors are very good but tzeentch already had a solid frontline with the chaos warriorschosen so they feel largely redundant  cockatrice is an all around good unit and does provide more antiinfantry in a faction that has little of it  the mutileth beast is fun but an antilarge unit with a mortis engine effect isnt as unique as it should be when the faction is already dedicated antilarge  no new lord or hero units feels like a mistake as well

cathay yuan bo is extremely strong and the concept of new compass directions is great  the rework of harmony makes things less frustrating at the cost of strategy thinking specifically lategame the old system could be a pain the crowmen are what youd expect from fell bat style units but slightly stronger than most the jade lion and jet lion do their jobs but feel fairly copy paste and dont answer the holes in cathays roster  the war drum is a solid idea but fairly clunky on implementation and again doesnt fill holes in the roster  the celestial general gives a solid melee only lord choice but the lack of a similar hero when cathay desperately needs one stands out

kislev ostankya is very very strong  her mechanics are fun but her starting positions are both painful for her and feel unloreful her unique mechanics further hurt her because she starts away from the people she needs to make friends with to recruit most of kislevs units which makes the campaigns more frustrating the hag witch is great but makes the absence of a hag lord really noticeable as ostankya has no loreful secondary lord choices the things in the woods are fine but are objectively unloreful and feel weird in kislev armies  the akshina are frankly overpowered and render streltzi obsolete which feels wrong and the incarnation of beasts is about the same as tiiw for me the conspicuous lack of the lore of hags rounds out this side of the dlc as feeling really unloreful  where are the ungol units the hag lord the lore of hags shes supposed to be a master of

roc im a weird one in that i like doing the narrative campaigns sometimes  i amdeeply disappointed in them this time  having completed changling and started the other two it seems they exist in roc as an obligation not anything else  chorfs had a very very solid narrative campaign finishing changeling got a 30 second cinematic that had no payoff and literally no endgame reward for doing it  yuan and ostankya look to be similar in a game series that had such gems as sniktch killed malus and wound up taking tzarkan on as a narrative campaign reward it feels very wrong to see there be a faction that gets nothing for completing its narrative campaign  even before belakor could be banished instead of taken on the base roc factions at least got something and the chorfs getting the obliterate settlement spell was very fitting for them there being no reward wasa noticeable black mark in a series of black marks for this dlc

tldr the dlc suffers immensely from whats there is good but it was not nearly enough  i again got this for free if i hadnt i would have waited until it was at minimum on sale for 15 if not a steeper discount  my time playing with the content in this dlc affirms this further  i cannot recommend it at 25

to ca i can tell the devs have passion for this game still the things they did get to make for soc is very welldone stop letting your managers fuck it up the consumer base for this game is willing to buy into eternity if its good  this is not worth what your management dictated it had to be  it is not equal to chorfs in value and even for a lord pack its bare bones so the 15 that we were expecting wouldve been harder to swallow  let the people who care about the game make a product worth the price by expanding the team rather than cannibalize it for other projects and youll see opinion turn back around

#####

dlc is overpriced previous lord packs include 1 legendary lord character 1 lord character typically a stripped downgeneric version of the legendary lord a hero type 1 or 2 units that are missing from the faction usually that tied into the related characters and a monster or centre piece unit for 2 different factions however ca has not only increased the price stating it is because they released 3 legendary lords however none of these lords have the complete roster several other packs have 

ca has severely dropped the ball however outlining a unfortunate trend in their business practices shorting consumers for their own gain sacrificing public image and future profits for the short term gain this 

on top of that the public relations department has shown zero care for the game or the consumers 

the right to discuss is a privilegeit is not an entitlement you earn by playing the game  cas pr department

it is unfortunate that ca has released this dlc in a sorry state however if they can learn from this and improve i believe their image could be rehabilitated 

after all positive reviews are not something a game is entitled to it is a privilege gained from listening to its community

#####

just because they doubled the content in this dlc doesnt mean its worth half the price of a full game jesus people you went quite fast from overwhelmingly negative to very positive

#####

terrible attitude and  response from ca
buy our  or well doom your game nice one
seems to be taking a page from blizzards recent playbook

actual dlc pretty lack luster overpriced lords and minimal effort for a dlc costing half the cost of the game itself is a joke
dont waste your money
buy something from someone else where the developers actually care about the product theyre charging for and the community thats paying them

do better ca

#####

not the worst dlc in series history most overpriced yes

#####

if you truly believe 3 lords and a handful of unitsheroes are worth 25 you are probably brain damaged that is nearly half the of a full price game release if you really believe this dlc will provide nearly half the value of an entire video game then you have to be delusional especially now with baldurs gate 3 and armored core 6 released there are so many better ways to spend 25 on steam this is a slap in the face to the total war fanbase and i would not recommend purchasing this dlc unless total war is literally the only game you play if you play any other games spend this money there not here

#####

insanely huge price for the amount of content offered also its fantastic when rob threatens this games loyal community good job for whomever wrote that announcement

#####

dlc is marketed and priced as a premium dlc but recycles most of the content kislev as a race feels even more stitched together now that ostankya has nothing to do with patriarchs but has to have armies lead by them hags not having hag lore and ostankyas campaign mechanic being groms but recycled makes her campaign feel unfinished the changelings campaign is very anti climactic and boring after you begin receiving 5 digit income in the first leg of the campaign it is impossible to lose also own it or not the ai plays all of the factions either poorly in the case of changeling or yuan bo or in a way that is very annoying and immersion breaking in the case of the ostankya entire army curse behavior all in all dlc feels very unfinished and ofc the update along with it broke many things including the ai if this is what continued premium support for the game looks like maybe creative assembly should hand over the keys to the kingdom to the community

#####

this dlc doesnt make me feel yolo swag

#####

add more content not even worth it on sale

#####

wait for sale

#####

im sorry guys i bought this because i have no selfcontrol and no selfrespect 


#####

this will perhaps will be the worst period for total war warhammer

what was to be the best entry in the trilogy has been made unfun by the aggressive predatory habits that ca has been embracing very shallow content for three times the price of the standard lord packs

ca has released an expansion for this dlc which obviously made it a lot better but still a costly one with little to no base game update

i am not expecting racial rework like wood elves or beastmen or warriors of chaos for game 3 races but i expected them at least to address the issues we have been flagging 2 years since launch kislev has aweful faction mechanics kairos  tzeentch  has the worst magic item system currently  i mean dwarfs got a better system to equip multiple items  only cathay seems in a good place although i would have welcomed a caravan upgrade to resemble chaos dwarfs

i also dont like removing content from older races to resell as something new  dark elves lost their slave system to chaos dwarfs high elves lost their trade vision to yuan bo  i am afraid wood elves will lose their ranged faction focus to a future slaanesh dlc lol 
i am okay with recycling faction mechanics but removing to rebrand as shiny new content is a big no

#####

the changeling is a bad addition to the game their settlements cant be destroyed and their armies are invisible almost every turn not a very fun campaign for the player and even worse to play against

i have to admit i didnt even try the other 2 leaders yet but i think the game design on the one i did try is so bad that this deserves a negative review i hope someone makes a mod to remove the annoyances this added

#####

content is lackluster value is probably around 6  7 euro

#####

the right to positive review is a privilege  it is not an entitlement you earn by releasing the game

#####

overpriced dlc money does not go back into the game funnels to crappy projects like pharo and hyenas

#####

only worth 15 bucks even with the dlc being updated

#####

8 new units for 25

#####

whole lot of nothing at a premium price

#####

as much as it pains me to say this as i love the game the dlc is too expensive for what you get i got lucky and won a giveaway but if i hadnt won i wouldve waited for a big sale

#####

this is overpriced ca doesnt seem to understand how bundles work you bundle stuff together and decrease price to make it a better deal instead they bundled an extra lord in and used that as an excuse to jack up the price beyond what is reasonable even after their update its still not worth it without a 30 discount imo

#####

greed is modern gaming cancer

#####

edit came back to change this to recommended as ca added more content now its worth a buy if you enjoy any of these three factions or beastmen you can find my original review below

overpriced for the amount of content on offer doesnt provide good value compared to any other dlc from the warhammer series dating all the way back to game 1 certainly some cool stuff on offer but insufficient for the asking price wait for a sale

#####

do not buy this dlc unless on deep sale

i bought it because i found a deal good enough and the characters included grew on me over time however this dlc is the pinnacle of everything wrong with creative assembly these days and the community boycotted it so hard  me included for several months  that it extended to tw pharaoh even forcing ca back on the path of actually delivering more than 1 patch every 4 months and leaving ages old critical issues unresolved which the patch only added many more to the prime issue is price

total war warhammer 1 and 2 got lord packs dlcs that included
 2 legendary lords factions for existing races with a unique gameplay style defining lord effect faction effect
 roughly 34 more new units for each faction
 1 legendary lord for free you didnt need to buy the dlc sometimes came with a few extra units sometimes didnt
 1 generic lord for every faction to spice up gameplay and army compositions for all armies
 1 generic hero for every faction to spice up gameplay and army composition for all armies
price 999

total war warhammer 3 lord pack dlcs
 3 legendary lords for 3 different factions so far so good
 roughly 34 units per faction so far so good but quality dropped now there are reskins included
 no free legendary lord faction so what happened is they made the previously free one paid but got more units features im willing to accept this if we stick to 5  faction
 0 or 1 generic lord cathay got a lord only 1 out of 3 factions included in the dlc no generic lords for kislev tzeench
 0 or 1 generic hero kislev got a hero only 1 out of 3 factions no generic heroes for cathay tzeench
 1 new legendary hero a hero unit who is unique from the lore and you can only field 1 in the whole vast world so has 00000001 effect on the game instead of generic heroes you can field as many as you can and only for 1 out of the 3 factions tzeench
price increased to motherf 2499 

are you serious ca this is less than the 999 packages content but you ask for more than an entire race dlcs price that containted a whole new culture race with 4 legendary lords meaning 4 playstlyes 4 start positions roughly 20 completely new units whole new faction mechanics across all of them and you ask for more for this than that 

are you out of your god damn mind then youve been banning people off steam community for criticising you and saying talking about our games is a privilage and your boss threatening the entire community that if we dont buy this we might just have to cut support for the game i guess putting it on sale so fast and pharaoh not making it to even top 1000 on steam preorder toplists and having less players than 20 year old total war games showed that you depend on us and if you treat us like trash we are happy to see the game go down with you

reasons i bought this
 i found a deal for 16 which is my acceptable price maximum for this pack and im being generous with including inflation as if it didnt hit me harder as an end user than a company who is going to write off their 900 million  cancelled game as tax returns
 giving credit where credit is due ca really pulled themselves together profoundly apologised for their unacceptable behaviour towards their community and delivers better patches with more fixes at a more frequent rate i am willing to restore some amount of faith in them and support the project 
 leaks from the games biggest livestreamer who ca just blacklisted for life for openly speaking his opinion about all of this claiming when the next big patch drops with the next dlc shadows of change is getting extra content retroactively and thrones of decay next dlc will aim to match the price now with the whole fiasco behind us and ca clearly getting the message more precisely their management got the message that their golden egg chicken dies really fast if they feed it with garbage i want to believe thrones of decay and shadows of change will be worth their price as of right now i cannot recommend it unless on roughly 50 off

highly recommended mods specificly for this dlc
 journey to the west moves yuan bo  the governor of central cathay  back to central cathay from lustria where ca put him in their infinite wisdom for variety
 mother ostenkya moved to kislev the hag in the spooky woods of kislev tamer of spirits of the wild who protects the motherland start in nagarroth in ie two freaking continents away for variety 
im fairly sure this will never change but thankfully modders can change it because the content itself is good

#####

dlc has become to expensive in the world and this is a prime example of it why is the dlc for a game half the price of the original full game adding such little content despite hoever many hours you put into developing it doesnt justify the price tag

this dlc at maximum value is worth 5 or maybe 8 for 2025 quid we should have gotten 10 legendary lords multiple new campaigns and a boat load of extra content

palworld is 25 and thats a full game this is extra content for an already existing game 



the lords are ok to use but not the best new units are cool and i enjoy using them but not worth the dollar bills yall

#####

there are some people such as myself who will pay for any dlc that comes out for total war warhammer 3 ive been playing the warhammer series solidly since it came out as have my friends i dont tend to buy many games and i can justify paying full price for the dlc as such and many others will buy it when it inevitably comes down on sale
but this dlc adds a minimal amount of content for factions that i really do not care for if they charged this price and brought out araby ind or nippon i think ca would have an easier time justifying the price  this content is not justified
there is also the hamfisted way in which ca attempted to explain that buying the dlc is integral to supporting the dev team and keeping the game updated and alive  this is where the extreme majority of fans myself included have been irked 
i would like to see a little goodwill on cas part an apology and an attempt to make the community feel like a valued group and not just a consumer base that is there to be milked dry

#####

even after this dlc got updated with more content it still has such a mediocre price value for what you get i got it on sale for 25 off and it still didnt feel good to buy and it comes down to something very simple there are no race reworks included in the pack even after the outcry about how cathay kislev and tzeentch still felt awful to play with or without the new lords ca decided to ignore that feedback and just add pretty new units and legendary heroes

    kislev lacks the mechanics to make kostayltan unique from katarin and boris to make his campaign have a direction kostayltan still recruits ice witches instead of focusing on boyars and patriarchs boris still supports the race between them and still has the ice witch mechanic when he should do something for both patriarchs and ice witches the only thing kislev got was making nonmajor cities into regular capitals which is nice but barely scratches the surface of what kislev shouldve gotten

    cathays only change was making their race mechanic passive and boring absolutely neutering it and making them less distinct from the empire it is the same as going back to the empires mechanic in the first game with small bonuses for placing lords in office instead of corralling and maintaining the empire

    lastly tzeentch got fuckall literally the changelings mechanics are so unique to him that tzeentch got nothing substantial with this pack other than units you have to work forever for just to get

    everyone is flipping their reviews for this dlc cause ca listened no they didnt they just gave you the bare minimum once again and hoped everyone would ignore that the races still suck to play this is going to be the only dlc for these races for quite a while and they will be left in this awful state we are not back in the days of the grim and the grom dlc where the races included got a substantial rework and became extremely fun to play all that was needed in this dlc was minor touchups and ca couldnt even bother 

    maybe its worth it if shadows of change is ever 50 but that will only happen in a year or two from now so everyone is left with a less stinky pile of garbage compared to a rotten one from months ago

#####

i will change my review if the content added in 42 makes worth it

edit the new units are good i would have liked more campaign changes to kislev cathay and tzeentch but overall its a big improvement

#####

i had a buy this dlc because my 10 year old son was so excited for it and i couldnt let him down 

personally from being a fan of the series from day 1 and having well over a 1000 hours game time between the three titles this would have been the first time i wouldnt of brought a dlc crazy money for less content mind blowing decision making going on over there at ca i really hope they listen to what the community has said but i doubt it

#####

good 

#####

it cant be overstated how bull the pricing is with how wh3 has been mistreated not cool ca not cool

edit

admittedly the above was prior to playing this dlcs content and i can say most of the other sentiments ring true its not worth the price the new lords are neat the cathay yinyang changes make the faction feel better to play but this dlc compared to previous ones is absolutely rough i can spend so much time in comparisons but others have done that enough 

ca this is fed plain and simple youre making the game and parts of it less accessible after making such a big effort to do so yet again ruining what good will you had with your playerbase youve taken one step forward and fallen on your a
i was happy to hear hyenas canceled until reminded that corporate will probably take out their frustrations on the tw franchise lo and behold they already have started doing that 

final words
ca is now synonymous to eddy from ed edd and eddy and no one can change my mind at least the latter made it entertaining to watch

#####

after this new dlc content update i still think is kinda pricy but at least now we got more content delivered

and just for the record in every dlc a faction new mechanics i really expect something new so i can have a new experience playing an already known faction and not the same thing with a new lord

tzeench still is the best part of this dlc the new campaign that its not the kairos campaign with a different lord the campaign is really fun and different and the ability to transform in any lord you defeat gives you a lot o ways to play with your army
with the new units they upgraded not only tzeench faction but some other factions too the centigors can be used in other chaos aligned factions but anyway with this new additions if i rate it it would be 910
previoulsy 8510
and this campaign still is really easy is almost impossible to lose no matter the difficulty


cathay campaign still is mediocre and of course is basically like playing the other 2 characters campaign with a different new lord the state faction mechanics are laughable and had no change in that but now the new units are good the legendary hero is really good amd the blue bird is insanelly fast but anyway this part improved after the new content but its still mediocre i cant rate higher than 610
previoulsy 4510


kislev campaign continues horrible the hexes mechanics are a worse version of grom cauldron the campaign is really boring but now the change in the units made the whole faction much better the new update even brought content for those who does not have the dlc also a new lore of magic and the new low level anti infantry made the early game much better they are really good meatshields anyway its the worst part of this dlcas it was before but now is at least bad with some good content i would rate 410
previoulsy 110

i really wished for creative faction mechanics like in the previous dlcs from twwarhammer 2 but at least the tzeench one is really good but other 2 i hoped for some new changes and we got the same thing

so concluding this dlc still is expensive now at least we have content for the money some of the new units can make this purchase worth it but for the content delivered i cannot say that is worth every penny if you can wait buy in a sale but if you buy it now at least you get new content not too much not the best but you will get content

the full dlc would be rated 6310 by far not the best but not the worst either

#####

i am an avid player of this game and shadows of change is not worth the price and i bought it 

 the dlc is unpolished and the game is incredibly buggy feels like the game is an open early access project i would not buy this dlc on that matter alone wait for it to go on sale its probably the lowest quality dlc i have seen for a total war warhammer game 
 the game itself needs an entire custodian team focused on efficiency working base game features and races

#####

i got this dlc from a 3rd party for under 17 and still feel like i been ripped off i hear some rumor saying that the next dlc will either be the same price or even more really

#####

after patch 42 the content included in shadows of change is substantial in my opinion is still a little bit pricey but worth buying

#####

i sadly bought the dlc luckily on another site that had a better deal but i highly recommend no one to buy this dlc ca really messed up on this one they need to add more to the dlc and to get a custodian team to fix the game while the dlc team can focus on the dlcs costs are up yes they are but if you either lower the price or actually put more quality in the dlc and the game as a whole for bugfixing and more out more resources to your cash cow then you will get more money i know this was probably a management decision so screw the suits that made the decision while you devs you do the best you can do

#####

by the architect i wish there was a neutral option for reviewing 

look im gonna sidestep the pricing issue entirely this is a review of the dlcs contents the bits and bytes that make up three new campaigns three new lords a couple of heroes and a smattering of units to be more specific the changeling campaign because thats what ive played so far and lets be real hes the star of the dlc

and holy moleyi feel as if a new day has dawned for tzeentch fans like myself because its a friggin blast

until now tzeench fans have had four real options kaiross miserable realms of chaos campaign his immortal empires campaign that plunks you between two hard counters in the form of a slaaneshi faction and effing oxyotl and the villitch campaigns neither of which i can find anything glaring to really complain about

but there was a damning factor in these four campaigns one that pestered me even in the vilitch campaigni didnt feel like i was playing tzeentch

i didnt feel like a manipulator i didnt feel like i was undermining my foes and destroying them before my first horror set foot on the battlefield i was ungabungaing my way through enemy faction leaving a trail of desolation in my wake 

but then i started the changeling campaign and i had the biggest shiteating grin on my face as i played with fate like the strings of a harp i snuck around cackling as i planted cults in smaller undefended settlements for the sole purpose of having them spread into larger welldefended settlements without me having to lift a finger i found myself blowing through grimoires like coffee filters as i spammed changing of ways which i never found the need to do when trying to play kairos or vilitch 

i felt like a manipulative conniving dbag and i loved every second of it i felt like i was playing a proper tzeentch faction

did i spend way too much on this dlc even with it on sale probably do i regret it not really especially realizing that a few units like tzaangors and cockatrices give me a reason to try beastmen again when im done heck i might do archaon or villitch again they get access to mutaliths

like i said id rather not dive into the pricing controversy not when i can sit back and enjoy playing the bill cypher of the warhammerverse

#####

the sheer greed and disrespect for costumers that this company emanates has no equal disgusting

#####

first of all the price its to high 
when it released it was over 20 sorry but no thats just greedy

the only lord that plays different then others is the changeling 
yuan bo  mother ostyanka just bring new units 

changeling 
unique playstyle that gets overpowered very fast but thats ok it makes fun and thats what i want from a game
only downside is his replayability is not existend your schemes are allways the same and are cool when you play him the first time but after that not

yuan bo
cathay in a bit better version then it was before plays nice and the new units and mechanics are kinda fun but overall its cathay if u didnt like it before yuan bo wont change your mind

mother ostyanka
i was hyped for her the most brings a bit of slavish horror into the game what i really liked in witcher but there is one big big big downside to her that ruins her playthrough who in the bloody hells had the stupid idea to put the secret protector of kislev on nagarond as a starting point if you want the full kislev army roster with her you have to control kislev praag or honorgard hope its called like that in english sry if not which are all north of the bloody empire there is no bloody way to get there quick to get the full kislev roster so you have 8 yes 8 different units to fight the woodelves dark elves maybe mazdamundi if u mess with him taurox morathi malekith 8 units specially morathi  malekith can be a absolute pain to deal with because of the strong dark elven units but dont worry you have 8 units to fight them 
not to mention that loreways its absurd that she isnt even close kislev she is the bloody secret protector and now she is in nagarond because vacation ok she wants stronger hexes but for that she leaves kislev and make it more vulnerable makes absolutely no sense

pls dont buy it for 20 not for 15 10 would be ok but not more

ca pls but mother ostankya to kislev where she should be

#####

worth it with half of its price

#####

i had no intentions of buying this dlc until a substantial sale a friend gifted it to me unexpectedly 

25 isnt going to break the bank on its own its the implications for further dlc down the road that worries me if every dlc from here on out is 25 and offers the same amount of content then that is a problem

#####

not only is it overpriced but this is a genuine low point in quality no campaign features new assets with final battles being fought on generic siege maps and open fields in comparison to the previous two dlcs which for all their faults had a narrative a sense of escalation and sweeping faction changes this dlc opts to make boring tweaks and reskins old mechanics warden and the paunch was only 3 years ago and offers more for a 13 of the price 

skip this one buy hollow knight instead and use the spare change for take out

#####

crying i dont know you anymore ca youre breaking my heart youre going down a path i cant follow

#####

greedy bastards

#####

this is where the greed hits the fan buyer beware fed up fans have had enough sure you can play and complete the campaign but more often than not you get irritating bugs that take out the fun or immersion then theres the near total lack of communication from the devs you only really get news or updates once theyre ready to drop another buginfested dlc on the game finally theres this turd pricier than a race pack but far less content than the previous lord pack champions of chaos or heck even the ogre preorder

now concerning this dlc itself its just an egregious mess the old hag is just a reskined drycha with a low quality groms cauldron to make her relevant theres the powercreep ap stalking crossbows that also do quite good in melee because kislev the jade guy is a cathayan high elf playing the game 2 vortex campaign was kinda looking forward to playing his campaign but upon actually playing it it was meh lastly theres the changeling man where to begin in a nutshell hes the changeling i guess guys a mess his design was supposed to be awesome but just devolves into choose skarbrand or kugath or any other no mount beast the scribes are way more fun

overall this dlc exactly embodies everything youd stay away from of a piece of content overpriced low quality turd but hey buy it or no more support right rob

stay away from this piece of excrement

#####

its average but accompanied by a ridiculous price and a patch that made the ai flounder about on open battle maps for some reason im not even talking about cheesing them just play a game normally and youll see or try a siege battle and watch them freak out at the idea of coming up onto their own walls to fight your archers theyll stand there staring whilst theyre shot to death

 at the end of the day this isnt worth 1999 whilst yuan bo and changeling playstyles integrated as intended into their factions ostankya is a weird one theres a disappointing lack of amendments to tooltips buildings names flavour text unit limitations etc considering shes a witch waging a guerilla war against the enemies of kislev with beasts and akshina allies she  at least doesnt use atamans
given how much ca love to reuse old stuff and pretend its new why exactly there isnt the same split as seen between orion and the treeguy seems like laziness

 i got lucky enough to get it free off a legendtotalwar livestream but otherwise id give it a miss 

oh and the game crashes in battle a fair bit now which has never been an issue prior as i have plenty of drive space and play on max settings no problem it definitely seems to be linked to the 40 patch in some way  3 crashes in a single turn 40 changling campaign sheesh

a final piece for those of you who like a high percentage of achievement completion  patch 40 saw immortal empires achievements for all nonwarhammer3 races added want to know the problem unless you paint the map which takes endless hours of grind per race or face off against their ultimate crisis which many of us have beaten enough times to be sick of it you dont get the achievements at all short victory condition nope long victory condition still not good enough 

how many hours do they think people want to spend on a single campaign in wh3 because i doubt its as long as 1 or 2

#####

very overpriced for the quality of the product

#####

paid 25e only because i am stupid

#####

its way overpriced and lacking in terms of content i was ok with price point for chaos dwarves but this cannot stand

#####

3 heroes and some units digital items

not worth it at all  this was ultimate greed


development of this cant be so god damn expensive just 3 bloody heroes with bit of extra units stfu ca thats you alienating me and other users with such stupid practice bro dont test us  gamers we will begin pirating it

#####

only purchased because sfo has updated and venris has added the things that youd expect lore of hags etc i hate that i had to send ca my money and couldnt send it to venris instead

#####

the price is way to high but thats not my main problem the lords in this are just bland even if it was the normal 999
i would still not recommend

1 the changeling he is honestly just way to easy it became boring within 10turns i feel like a sperm could win this campaign all you do is make 1 cult and then you can never lose being perma invisible near a cult is just way to broken with how easy it is to make one and its way to easy to make it so your cults are never found also one of the units is just a beastmen unit but blue hentai monster good tho

2 yuan bo i think his campaign is the most fun but still rather boring its just cathey with some new bonuses like rushing buildings or recruitment with his mechanic the new bell unit is actually one of the most useless units ive used in this game the 2 statue lions are nice tho but theyre just the same thing really so its kinda just 1 unit they reskinned into 2 

3 mother ostankya probs the worse paid dlc lord they have ever done her mechanic is just grom the paunch but worse and her units feel more like beastmen units then kislev why is the incarnate elemental of beasts a kislev unit it makes 0 sense the only unit that makes sense for kislev is the dudes in the furry suit with bows the other 2 are just beastmen units

remember when we got a rat with nukes snipers miniguns and little deathballs good times



#####

after the last patch the price value aligns a bit more however there were so many lies in the pressreleases from ca andthat all that bs needed to happen in the first place so my recomendation is wait for a pritty steap sale if you realy want to have this dlc

#####

i got this on sale and at this time its still not worth it that being said ca have caved theyve admitted they screwed up and they are going to be adding new content to this dlc thats going to be free for anyone who owns it and will just be part of the intial purchase going forward for anyone else not fully convinced yet but what they have revealed of the content so far does look promising its a shame it took this much for them to learn from their mistakes but change seems to be happening keep your eyes open and if it ends up being worth it ill likely end up changing my recommendation

#####

price is bad

#####

i just bought this dlc from a cdkey site for a reasonable price and i still feel ripped off

#####

this is another one negative review about new dlc priceing but not just priceing more about regional price
ill try to be short im from ukraine and there was regional price even before war come to our home its hard to sell games full price when local average salary is about 400500
ill type some prices on new summer games and some old complex one in local currencyuah
baldurs gate 3  900uah
jagged alliance 3  835uah
rimworld  470uah
stellaris  480uah
and even old big dlc from ca  rise of the tomb kings  400uah
and last 2 dlc for total war warhammer 3 is cost 850uah
wtf is this some commercial mistake or some kind of ukrainofobia i dont know what this was and why but for sure it will makes sales in already exhausted country near zero
i understand that this is their product and they can put any price they whant 100000 or 1 but this is my voice as customer who already bout all 3 games with all dlc except beastman and 2 last overpriced garbage
bought reviewed refunded this is all for what this dlc exist

#####

i bought this to give the devs a christmas giftcall it a privilege

meanwhile this is a waste of money  absolutely wait for it to be cheap do not bother for any other reason



#####

this was the dlc that broke the camels back caused a huge backlash from fans forced sega and ca to drop hyenas for a 100 million loss and apologize to everyone the boycott was real and it was spectacular

sega and ca went into overdrive on this one like they took their already cashgrabby model for wh3 and doubled it half the content for twice the price i grabbed it for about 40 off and this happened pretty quick after release 15 is about what this dlc is worth

#####

way overpriced

#####

3224 update

with the latest additions added as a result of customer dissatisfaction with the initial version of soc its become much more valueable

played another run of rasputin and found much utility in the new woodspeasant commander and the halberdiers  the former buffs low tier skirmishing armies which synergize well with rasputins playstyle and the latter finally gives a unit that loses out on ranged fire but can stand twice as long in melee holding large units back so the other units can shoot them to death  the ice dragon as many have mentioneddoes not work and its shame because i really like the animations  it needs a serious buff

cathays new heroes are the perfect buffers for turtling players which suits the cathay playstyle as well  i havent had much action with their new epic hero as unfortunately directfire missiles dont do great in the terraced farm maps littering cathay  i imagine in an open map its be brutaland it does seem statswise to be overpowered

i havent played though a tzeench campaign since the 2nd round of soc units was released but ill mention them when i do

overall the new additions improved my kislev and cathay runs and on the basis of those units and their related new factions im satisfied with the dlcthough still consider it the leastenjoyable in wh3

i dont think theyve fixed the gameplay issues with the changling being a oneplaythrough faction but i hope its given modders enough new stuff to work with to make better mods

so im changing my rating to positive but stillget it after youve got all the other dlc released for 3 unless your favorite factions are kislev or cathay  it isnt great but the many adiditions have at least indicated that its possible ca will put a little more effort into dlc in the futurewhich really concerns me since dwarves empire and nurgle is nextmy three favorite factions





tldr  if you havent gotten all the other dlc for twwh already get those first  this isnt a horrible dlc but its overpriced and doesnt feel as developed as many of the major dlc thats come before

if people asked me if there was one dlc that they could take a pass on it would be this one  not that it doesnt have some fun toys in it but because the cost compared to the quality of the systemsfactions is less that other dlc accounting for how patches fixed old dlc was wasnt always good out of the box

ca seems to have taken the public criticism to heart and plans to add a lot of content to this dlc on the back end and if they do i will revise my review based on the content addedchanged  right now i would say if youre a person who doesnt see cost as the main criteria for purchases and you love whfb this is still worth gettingjust that compared to the quality of mods coming out this is not valued at the price its set at

not to say there hasnt been excellent dlc for wh3  both coc and the cd dlc were both filled with content and new systemsid put them on par with any other dlc released for the series as a whole with the exception of the tomb kings

#####

greedsy devs

#####

this dlc just reeks of corporate greed highlighting the bad business decisions and decreasing quality from ca it just doesnt make sense how are you going to charge the same amount of money as a full race pack such as the chaos dwarves but have not even half the content i would be more than fine with this price if the content was there if you are going to charge the same as a race pack i would expect at the very least the same amount of content as a race pack to show for it instead what we got is essentially barely the same content as previous lord packs but spread thin across 3 lords instead of 2 for a massive price increase  

when they announced they would do lord packs with 3 lords it got me excited i expected ca would add a third faction amount of content for what i would think would be a reasonable price increase but what they did was just take the content we used to get for 2 factions and spread that thin across 3 factions if you are gonna do it like this just give me the old lord pack style so each faction could feel more fleshed out this new style just makes each faction feel lackluster and incomplete not to mention the fact that how we used to get a free legendary lord but instead it pretty much feels like they just stuck that flc lord onto the dlc as mother ostankya and expect us to pay for that giving us a free hero instead when i saw the lackluster list of units for this dlc i thought at least they may give us amazing campaign mechanics but really just the changeling feels like it has great mechanics and all the effort went there yuan bo is nothing special and mother ostankya just feels weird and full of questionable decisions from her lack of hag lords not enough thematic units to start location they even have the balls to take one of cathays new units the big lion reskin it into two different colors with some stat changes and call that 2 new units out of the only 4 units cathay gets 

the price of the dlc aside the content still is not up to par the amount of units are lacking to make the factions feel fleshed out enough especially for ostankya the campaign just feels thematically wrong how could there not be hag mother lords to lead armies and not to mention the missing lore of hags for the price i would expect there at least to be generic characters for each slot of each of the 3 factions and a new lore of magic 

there is just no excuse for this low effort dlc combined with a huge price jump warhammer 3 had the potential to be the greatest strategy game ever and is cas golden goose but due to bad business decisions by what seems to be from the upper management they just have a skeleton crew running this game as all their money goes into crappy projects like hyenas instead of back into this game raising the prices for us to pay for their mistakes and not even having the decency to deliver on the content to match this raise in price

#####

not enough content for the price

please raise your standards ca and stop ripping off your player base

#####

bugs everywhere but they never fix it

#####

alright this is what happens when you let the sales and marketing guys make your business decisions for you  ca fire the suits  they are short sighted and will destroy your brand  you dont need them  the game itself is pretty amazing but the brand has been set on fire by the greedy bastards upstairs

#####

ive gotten this as a gift im glad i did since it covers two of the factions i was excited to play kislev and cathay 

i would however feel extremely bad and scammed if i bought this myself and for the full price dear god this is just crumbs for a huge price a slap in the face by ca shadows of change more like shtshow of change

 you ca

#####

a 20 discount and a patch that doubled the content was what it took to get me to buy this dlc but a 60 discount and double the content is what it would have taken to get me to recommend it shouldnt cost more than 15 in my opinion

#####

not worth the price  even on a sale  supposedly they are going to be adding to it so will reevaluate then

#####

not worth the price

#####

dlc is cool and all but fr wheres the rest of it

#####

3 legendary lords and a handful of new units for 25 is not a good deal this is worth at least 4 bucks on sale because if your paying 25 you should get at least a new faction

#####

im doing my part

#####

they all just kinda suck this really isnt worth the money and you should wait for a 50 or even a 70 off sale

#####

if you like changeling this is amazing but its not worth the price  wait for sale

#####

not worth the money

#####

get it on sale and its decent the new units are hit or miss frost wyrms are awful but the campaigns and mechanics are really interesting if op ostankya being able to just apply debuffs directly to enemies yuan bo being a menace with unit upkeep bonuses only beaten by orion and the changeling literally being unbeatable in campaign are just some examples

seriously the changeling is basically cheating even if all your armies die your cult lairs are almost indestructible
despite these bonuses however its half the price of the game just get it on sale do not buy at full price

#####

yeah who needs warhammer im sure pharoh and hyenas will more than make up for lost revenue and good will

#####

so little content but the price is so fxking

#####

i love you ca and i absolutely adore wh games which got me into wh overall but these prices are getting out of hand even your most loyal fans now questioning your decisions is it really worth it to lose them over short term profit

#####

i decided to buy this at around the usual price for a regular piece of dlc 20 off and because it felt so empty seeing certain things not have characters or units that the enemies already had

at its current state do not make the mistake i did wait until the next year where cw begins their redemption arc hopefully

#####

ca has promised to rework this dlc and adding the content they promised but didnt deliver a ton of new units as well as adding enough content to justify the new higher price point theyre trying to pass their dlc off at until the content rework happens i cannot recommend buying this dlc

edit i would say with the new content the new price point is more justified and the dlc is probably worth picking up on sale either way i am changing my recommendation to give ca some positive feedback

#####

they listened to the community and increased the amount of content in the dlc and have been releasing more frequent patches win win for every

#####

preclaimer i literally own every single piece of creative assembly content they have ever made for their games and this is the first time i honestly felt robbed

update content has been updated and it makes for a decent package now price is still high and not really in line with what a dlc pack offers but at least the package is somewhat decent now

actual content is fun and refreshing with the factions playing different from their core races

#####

they definitely need to add more content if they want to keep charging this price point not a good value

#####

theyve improved it since released indeed still better on sale but worth a try

#####

making a threat to the community and saying youll stop support when the community has been not only faithful but purchased in excess of hundreds of dollars of dlc and the main games over many years is absolutely unacceptable fix the bugs do better and the player base will fund and support you

#####

buy it on sale and id feel its worth the price the addition to it was not enough to completely change my view on cas recent business decisions but it definitely brought it up in terms of worth 

i still think chaos dwarfs is much better than this one though

#####

it would need to have a lot of content added retroactively to justify the price wait for a sale andor if ca adds said content

even if you use the most generous argumentation to justify the price you still cant do it even when accounting for inflation the price wouldnt be this high when compared to previous dlcs
like why isnt there a hag lord option for kislev why isnt there an onyx crowman hero option the dlc seems rushed at best and just a scam at worst

and this is even without mentioning the thinly veiled threats towards the consumer and a lack of support for the game people have been asking for a custodian team for total warhammer for a while and still havent gotten one you know it is bad if paradox is doing a better job than ca

now after playing it still isnt worth it not even accounting for all the things like a seeming removal of a house of chicken legs mount which an older version of mother ostankyas witchs hut might suggest or the fact that tzangors have mentions of beaks in their description while in reality just being blue reskins

on the topic of whether the lords are fun yes and no
the changeling has the most unique way to expand out of any faction unfortunately that way is way too safe for him making it impossible to lose it is literally impossible to lose a game as the changeling and you would need to go out of your way to let it happen besides that his faction is fun to play as

mother ostankya has good units and is fun to play in battle the major problem with her is that her faction is extremely tedious to play to unlock new hexes she needs to use up her campaign resources to make more blessings and curses the problem is that you need to go every single turn in that menu and make as much of it as possible it is combined with the fact that her unique landmark and one of her skills reduce spirit essence costs for them which obviously means more grinding

and getting trinkets basically requires you to go on a world tour to beat up or ally someone to get a tooth or some other thing like that seriously the only way to get a human tooth is to go and ally or beat up an empire faction it should require a trade deal not an alliance

another problem is that a large chunk of the kislev roster is locked away behind an alliance or taking control of one of the big three kislev cities noting that mother ostankya for some reason starts on the other side of the planet from kislev despite being a character that is the most linked to the land itself

yuan bo for some reason is going on an adventure in lustria despite being somewhat out of place considering the sea dragon would make a better fit for that location i kind of expect him to get moved from lustria back to cathay when ind and khuresh get added

besides that he is inoffensive as a lord

#####

disgusting and shameful to overprice a dlc for 3 lords and some units that most players will not even use completely or at all for me personally i will never buy another product or support you after basically insulting me as a player by saying hey you need to buy this overpriced dlc to unlock the paywall behind your beastmen units congrats ca you are amazing not

#####

im leaving this review to state that i am purchasing this dlc in response to the honesty course correction and forthrightness displayed by ca very recently its massively overdue and i wish that it hadnt taken such a major setback to bring about this  but i want to encourage further transparency better value as well as a larger quantity of dlc in future 

this is a good first sign theres still a long way to go but i love this franchise and truly hope that ca can continue on the course of redemption and get back to doing what they do best  offering truly creative and substantive additions to a beloved franchise

keep it up

#####

take whatever corporate tool has ended up in charge of this series over the last six months and fire them go find the useless parasites who have burned 100 of cas remaining goodwill in a single dlc and put them somewhere where they can never touch this series again i preordered this automatically without thinking assuming if it was 25 it would come with 25 worth of content instead im sitting here looking at a barebones 5 dlc and staring daggers at the tzaangors we were supposed to get which incredibly are just reskinned beastmen modders can do this for free and ca cant do it with all the money in the world shameful and embarrassing

#####

updates from ca speak to bolstering this dlc to round out the value and expand where the dlc is weakest this following a price reduction in twpharaoh is a potential sign of actual course correction with the company as my most played game franchise of all time i hope to see more of this

one change for the better is good a followup decision backing up their first response is great they have a great pipeline set up all they have to do is handle it with care how much money have they made off med 2 tw so many years later because a community built up around that gamethe game being at the core of that growth

#####

i consider myself a shill for games i enjoy and the price point didnt deter me too much as i enjoyed the chaos dwarf dlc a tonbut for the same price this is a joke expansion 

i would recommend against purchasing this and much rather looking into the modded factions  unit mods and such like nagash beasts most foul and the southern realms

more needs to be added to this dlc or a sharp price reduction 

i worry for the future of this game

id recommend putting the money towards baldurs gate 3 

#####

this review is mainly based on the content  not the price and i cant believe im writing a negative review but here we are i like the unit diversity added to the game but so far yuan bo and the changeling are not great trying out ostankya now and i think ill like her but well see

cathay tangent not directly related to this dlc  my only gripe with cathay in general is that they dont have any melee heroes theyre all casters almost every race ive played thus far has a good mix of melee and caster heroes but not cathay also they dont really have a lot of front line unit diversity youre kinda just pigeon holed into using the celestial guard and thats itthe majority of their units are rangedcasters lol whats the point of having rangedcasters if they dont have a front line to guard them kinda boring just having the celestial guard to rely on lastly i think the whole yin and yang mechanic is nothing more than a nuisance

yuan bo  okay so as a legendary lord hes cool the jade lions are cool too but honestly underwhelming they feel very squishy i wouldve rather seen a group of jadejet lions like 1620 models per unit also i hate the drum its so boring its just a giant slow moving drum that buffs your units cool my ll also buffs my units so whats the difference the celestial generals are cool but totally useless to yuan bo lol he has a talent that makes getting the shugengan lords better so not a lot of lord diversity is encouraged either lastly the crowmen are pretty good i like them the extra wu xing compass directions are so boring too and take awhile to get because the cities you need to go build this specific building in are so far away from your starting area that by the time you get those extra compass directions they dont really matter lol god cathay is just so boring its like the one accountant in the corner of his office who doesnt talk to anyone and doesnt do anything for fun except number crunch and gaze at the god awful office lighting above him

the changeling  so boring his campaign mechanics are to fight a few citiessettlements in the beginning to establish some parasitic cults so they can establish new cults in other cities note that you never actually own any settlementscities you just implant cults within them and move on this is important to know because symbiotic buildings offer you better long term benefits more money but they only do that if you dont attack them thats right you let your buildings do the heavy lifting your buildings will naturally spread cults to other cities so you dont have to destroy them and can make that moolah understandably you may be thinking hm whats the point of having an army then after i get a few cults going to do the work for me beats me man i like all the new units for tzeentch but this ll is one of the most boring ive ever played i will not be playing this guy ever again

mother ostankya  so far she actually seems to have a nice bit of unit diversity and the hexes seem interesting so far ill update my review if needed as i progress her campaign

verdict  only buy when on sale id say 25 is the top end of okay i would probably wait until its 50 off though for a truly fair cost for value transaction i wish i waited

#####

i finally purchased shadows of change i own every single dlc for twwh 1 2 and 3 i have held off for many months but now things are looking up sega and ca are realizing their total war community is valuable and should not be leeched from to make failures like hyenas protect your ip value your communities and they will value you

with the additional content coming in update 42 this dlc feels complete good job ca

#####

do not spend any money on this

#####

edit postupdate i still think this dlc is overpriced as far as the quality of the campaigns themselves are concerned but the new units are nice and represent a step in the right direction however the changelings campaign is still fundamentally broken ostankya feels like a hackedtogether campaign and yuan bo is somehow the most fun of the three weird anyway as far as dlc for these games is concerned still definitely wait for a discount hopefully ca has learned their lesson and the next lord pack will avoid the mistakes of this one 

too expensive for the amount of content here the lords themselves seem fine if a bit middleoftheroad compared to some of the better wh2 dlcs but they aint 25 good dont be like me wait for a deep discount

#####

fire the management and hire people passionate about total war

#####

what the hell did i buy i assumed based on the price point this was a race pack level expansion instead we got practically nothing weve been pretty good to ca this is the kind of stuff that just posions the water for no good reason do better ca

#####

with ca walking back a lot of the controversial things recently and incoming additional content as it stands right now this dlc is overpriced but the content itself is not bad really its around 15 in real value so id wait for a sale for the content itself three legendary lords with unique mechanics 

mother ostankaya as a ll is not very good some good spells healing but its just ok some of the new kislev units are good like hag witches give a little more diversity to spell casting for kislev and the elemental incarnate dudes are good for killing single entities campaign mechanics for this ll are pretty mid you can get craft good buffs and debuffs for enemies but thats about it some tzeentchy esque mechanics like teleporting armies to wood elf forests stopping enemy army movement forcing enemy attrition etc new quest battles for her arent great mostly protecting an ai lord forcing you to be hyperaggressive overall pretty bland but units are good

yuan bo for cathay was probably the most disappotining cathay is my favorite faction so this was not great yuan bo is a decent ll good to fly over the map and kill enemy lords or artillery and can use great damage spells in dragon form however new units are not great and i dont think i used any of them mechanics for yuan bo arent great either just mainly additions to the compass and giving buffs and debuffs like ostankaya quest battles are really nothing of note overall its not the best

the changeling is really the star of the show the second ll for tzeentch the other two ll are afterthoughts to pad out the dlc this is why you would buy this dlc for the changeling himself he can cast good spells and change into any ll in the game once you defeat them and some for quest rewards i ended up using azazel for most of my campaign since i got him early on new units for tzeentch are alright i liked the vortex beast blue scribes legendary hero are a must have every spell cast randomizes your spells out of a ton of options really a gamble but were really exciting the changelings campaign mechanics are also really great you hold no territory just float around the map pulling strings and making essentially skaven undercities that dont get destroyed unless they are discovered even in razed settlements they remain really good mechanics and encourages you to pull the strings to cause disruptions to factions and collapse them from within overall fantastic

#####

let this dlc remain as proof that when we vote with our wallet companies have no choice but to listen
the right to making money making by selling games is a privilege not an entitelement you earn by putting games on the market
big up to the poor devs desperatly trying to make a good game through all those higher decisions you guys deserve better

#####

im buying this only after the 42 rework never again ca

#####

i bought this dlc so nakai can finally recruit crocs oh wait he still cant

#####

a ton of new units

#####

its better now

thank you ca keep this up please


strike it costs way to much for the actual content youre getting
the 3rd faction in this dlc was literally the flc faction we used to get
no increase in actual content just costs way more this should not cost as much as a race pack

yuan bos dual starting position wtf why i dont want to be the administrator of lustria and cathay as that is his role
wtf is yin yin going to do when she eventually arrives if production doesnt actually stop lmao
yin yin would be 1000 better for the lustria expedition as its actually lore friendly also wtf ca
the units we got for cathay are actually just pathetic 2 fucking lions that nobody asked for melee lord nobody asked for at the time the crow men were maybe a bit cool but wtf are their tier 4  5 monster unit why give kislev and tzeenth that
are you going to open up nippon or something for yin yin because thats the only thing i see after this why would you even have 2 cathay starts in lustria you already fucked it

also ca philosophy of not having op units as starting units goood job you removed so many tier 45 units from existing factions but you add it to mother ostankya why are you so wishy washy so some factions can have tier 45 units but other dont be also her starting position yea no i just hate it why in naggarond yea i just dont like it yea ik the position that was prob the best would be to close to boris ursus but still doesnt make it good

the changeling an easy campaign you cant lose sounds very fun its actually hard to lose
20 turns in aaaand yea already bored of it interesintg way to play a campaign without actually conquering it but thats what prob appeals to most players the most tzeentch really got the best units here also 2 legendary heroes wtf save some for the other factions as well they also exist
tzeentch were the winners in this update and cathay got left in the garbage bin
every unit tzeentch got actually looked cool except tzaangors cmon you did them dirty just a reskin how did that go last time you did it with chaos warriors

all in all
cathay got robbed 
starting positions doesnt make sense literally there are better options out there yin yin for an expedition
tzeentch actually got nice units poor tzaangors but 2 legendary heroes why only for them
kislev yea just dont like the position also love the classic wishy washy attitude of what faction gets to keep a tier 45 unit
costs way to much for what its worth almost half the price of the actual gamesigh and we all know we wont be getting a secret flc faction like we used to rakarth was prob the last one ever

there are loads of other things outside of the game i just dont like atm that i didnt bring but hyenas i wish the price increase actually supported the continuation of the game not a doomed fps team everybody already hates it before its even released and its because its taking resources that warhammer couldve had
pharaoh is probably also doomed to fail at launch but who knows
also you really gotta think through your upper management team stop shooting yourselves in the fucking foot
 all the bugs the bugs fucking hell man what a disaster

#####

still should be less

#####

the right to a positive review is a privilege one you do not get by simply making the game

ca charged 12 the price of the game for a very lazy dlc that introduces no new factions and just three new lords and some units

update

the changeling lord is busted 
i mean the power trip is insanely fun at first but then you quickly realize
you cannot lose playing as him
any time he has a cult building he will return 
cult buildings function like skaven under cities but are 10x harder to detect
there is no way his current playstyle model will last any human player that plays him will win it is impossible to lose 
yeah he is fun to play but man he is too strong in his design

#####

i bought this at release and was in the minority that wasnt enraged by its state though i was quite disappointed by the delivery of seemingly so little content compared to what we were used to for a higher price with the announcement that more is being added and what looks to be plenty of value i have no further qualms with giving this dlc my recommendation to promote companies fixing their mistakes

i hope ca and sega do not make these same mistakes again and that just maybe other companies that are still getting away with way more scumbaggery will follow cas example

#####

you know what you did sega

#####

i bought this dlc on release and i have still not played the changling who cares yall are long overdue for giving fans of this franchise some free content i did not expect to pay 200 more dollars for what 10 new lords over a few years pathetic

very underwhelming

#####

in short 

you get less content less quality less free content for a 150 price increase

dontbuy and play anything that comes out of this company they have clearly lost their mind


ps im a lost warhammer fanboi and cant help myself in buying this shit anyway

#####

okayyyyyyyyyyyy lets talk about this dlc were not going to talk about the ridiculous price  thats been covered by everyone else  no we are going to talk about the actual content within 
i just finished beating all 3 lords campaigns on very hard and i have thoughts i want to share 

do any of you remember the vampire coast dlc which in my opinion was the last time ca actually made an effort with their quest battles the campaigns final battle was good fun and i loved it ever since thenugh at best they are forgettable 
this dlc illustrates laziness

ostankya and the changeling has the exact same final campaign battle protect 3 casters so they complete a ritual or kill the lord of the attacking army
there is no real difference and hell as the changeling you can even appear as ostankya in it lol 
so there is that

ostankyas campaign is boring short and there is nothing special about her or it 
changeling campaign cannot be lost so is very easy but feels like a slog 
yuan bo is fun units and lord but his final battle is a snooze you literally dont have to do anything the ai reinforcements you have inside the city just kills the lizardmen army for you while you afk grab a drink use the bathroom 

they proclaimed there was a lot of work done on the back end for the changeling his theater systemmechanicbut as a former modder of this game honestly not much work goes into that theater mechanic its literally just objectives like raze altdorf the battles at the end of each were very easy as the enemy routes almost immediately for whatever reason and there is just nothing new weve had undercity like building chains for awhile them not going away on razing is something we got with oxyotly or whatever that little skinks name is 

all in all this dlc has some cool looking units yuan bo has cool animations butthats it 

so i dont recommend this as essential 
none of the units make or break their factions this is not a sisters of avelorn kind of dlc





#####

solid change from old strategy and new template for future products its good to acknowledge mistakes and learn from them

#####

i effing love this game im also a completionist so i obviously got this dlc i have all the dlcs of wh1 and wh2 im probably going to have all the wh3 dlcs when the plug is pulled but the game as much as i like it could be in a much better place if it was given the right amount of support its outrageous how badly managed its been and while the price of this dlc becomes not so good when you think about content qualityquantity in comparison with past offerings it becomes ibadi when you think of the state of the game at large its contentitis at its best  just give players new stuff and leave everything else the same 

i know the content train cannot be stopped but id be happy if they just focused for one entire patch cycle to fixing outstanding issues like mp desyncs factionwide bugs useless items and imbalances and of course reworking already existing mostly abandoned faction mechanics just like ca can settle prices at whatever they want we can demand they match them with reasonable management of the game itself in short ca has earned even the suspicion of many erstwhile fans and i think thats bad for the game in the long run a game id love to support for as long as possible

#####

my personal opinion can best be put by watching both cody bonds and legend of total wars videos the dlc is very mediocre and it feels like a cash grab more than anything my final words on this if you want to know what i see as helpful the idea that the changeling can be any lord that you slayed is really awesome thats it also do not buy this until it goes on sale or hopefully ca just lowers the price the company needs to be ashamed for this i bought this knowing the price was outrageous cause i have the money to spare and am a completionist but they shouldnt be able to do this in the future and if they do i will just not buy any as i hope we all will

as an edit if you wanna spend an hour or two watching videos watch some of volounds about ca it kinda shows how scummy ca can get

#####

with the additional units they added this dlc is now worth full price 

#####

cash grab in the ugliest of ways

#####

the content is not worth the cost 
3 very distinct legendary lords with a moderate selection of new units balance issues aside all play differently and are very fun however the price tag is far too steep for the content provided for context warhammer 2 would release lord packs like this with 2 equally unique lords  1 lord for free all for 10 the free lord was far simpler mechanically but who can complain when its free based on that i expect this dlc to be 15 if ca is going to claim a price hike for increased development costs then i could understand raising that to 18 but 25 is so egregious i just can not recommend this dlc

#####

content is pretty good way too expensive almost as much as a full priced game buy on sale legendary heroes suck return to giving us a free legendary lord with each dlc like the previous tww games please

#####

i got this dlc for a discount and i really want a refund back

thats how bad it is

#####

honestly the campaigns are not that fun
the changeling has the best and most interesting campaign he is the most fun out of the three 
yuan bos campaign basically sums to conquer these settlements build a building wait for several turns do a final battle 
ostankya has a weird starting location and doesnt really play into the kislevite faction mechanics
the new units are kinda cool though
id give it a meh rating like 510

#####

shadows of greed

#####

buying this in response to the openness and intention to fix that ca has demonstrated
people want to play tw3 and dont have an issue buying the dlc if the content is worth it no one wants to get shafted for a poor product

#####

underwhelming is one way to describe it not worth 25 eurosdollars

#####

this dlc had some issues had to few units  a price hike  lacking story  underwhelming lord mechanics

as of a free update to the dlc that has doubled or more the units  added legendary heroes  lords  heroes  bug fixes and some streamlining on mechanics it is now worth the price ca put in good work  they earned back the trust  so it gets a positive review now

hope they keep it up for the next dlc thrones of decay as well

#####

worth 10 wait for a 60 discount at the bare minimum

#####

this was going to be the first dlc that i wouldnt pick up but seeing how ca actually took a step back and corrected the content of this dlc im happily buying this now thank you for listening ca and showing the fans that we really do have a say in the direction this game and its expansions will go

#####

why bother making content if youre just going to condemn the people that buy it and play it tw wh was is so excellent that i have every dlc ive bought nearly every other total war game inspired by how great tw wh is they have the gall after spending over 500 on tw wh alone and at least a hundred or two more on the other titles to say they arent making enough money and have to triple the prices either they are completely fiscally irresponsible or just extremely greedy after the company daemonized the players and threatened to discontinue support they either owe their customers an apology or they deserve to go under utterly reprehensible behaviour your game already costs more then every other game ive bought in the last 25 years combined and thats not a light statement even on sale its over 400 to buy the game if it wasnt the only thing keeping warhammer fantasy alive they would never see my money again someone at that company has dug their grave and hasnt put any points to raise dead it seems the chaos corruption has overcome ca the end times have come ca how will you ever recover from this loss of dignitas more saga games certainly isnt going to go it past all of that a big issue with this game is its only really playable about 13 of the year every dlc creates a plethora of bugs that arent addressed for 23 months and then 1 month later theres another dlc that bugs up the game again if you are a follower of slaaanesh and love to castigate yourself then go ahead and buy this game beware that it will consume your wallet and apparently your soul as the pr department has displayed lets go brandon

#####

i am no patience man special power  complete void of patience 

please dont buy this at full price the lords are cool but this is just ca greed pure and simple 

this is a 10 dlc tops 

dont be no patience man

#####

the content is good but not for the price point what about this justifies a 150 increase from previous dlcs seems like we get less units i could stomach buying this for 15 but it doesnt seem right to pay nearly half the price of the base game for this for comparison the champions of chaos dlc really feels amazing in comparison that added so much content and came with a race rework that makes woc one of the most fun thematic and replayable campaigns in any total war game yet it was only 15 

the changeling is really unique while the other two campaigns have some reused fun flavor from other campaigns good to great content but a very hard sell to people for the price

#####

i can say point blank that this dlc was not worth 25 bucks straight up there is not enough content the races getting the content arent getting the update they need to remain viable my advise save your money and wait for a sale if you feel like getting it hopefully cas promise to actually add the content this actually needs to be worth 25 bucks ends up being true if they actually add content that meats the price tag ill retract this review and give a positive one of added content if not well this will stand  not worth 25 bucks

#####

feb 20th 2024 edit the amount of content this pack introduces is being roughly doubled with a new patch however i have no plans to update this review because 1 the amount of new content is so much that it would take a complete rewrite of this review 2 theres too many other recent releases and my backlog that id rather play 3 i dont approve of the devs treating this like a live service game with their dlc pipeline and 4 i still dont think tww3 is worth playing over 2 im keep this review for posterity because this dlc released in a terrible state and trying to bandaid fix it five months later is unacceptable

this dlc is a turd pinched out by the handful of life support staff that are still working on tw3 tw2 lord packs would basically be two lords of opposing factions also with story mission interactions new units for their factions and a flc lord with the same patch all for 999 this pack is three lords less units per faction than old packs and barely any new features for the new lords introduced for the bloated price tag of 2499

the biggest missing content is glaringly obvious with momma stanky who doesnt come with new magic and no new generic heroes leaving her still recruiting boyars and ice witches her starting position makes no sense and she just feels like early access like the rest of the game the changling campaign is boring because it basically isnt possible for him to die he is always in ambush stance but he cant be detected confederating him as kairos causes all of the changeling cults tzeentch undercities to blow up and confederating kairos as him causes all of his cities to raze yuan bo comes with the same dragon transformation bugs that have been in the game since launch in addition to his dragon forms attack hitbox not hitting and his animations glitching out 

i preordered this dlc because it was on sale for 18 off on a key seller site and fomo got the better of me if the content in this dlc was more fleshed out it still would only be worth half its asking cost the absurd price jump is unforgivable considering how unfinished this feels i bought all previous dlc except chorfs which was a gift because i really loved tw2 and i figured id eventually move onto tw3 unfortunately this dlc and this game arent worth playing over 2 still dont waste your money on this

#####

content is too expensive three totally overpowered legendary lords a few totally op units no new lore of magic and no real update for cathay and kislev i didnt check tzeentch dlc is not worth this price buy with a 50 discount at minimum

#####

lack of content is one thing for the price but the amount of unresolved bugs and new bugs added with the patch is unacceptable

#####

greed

#####

its actually a decent dlc each new lord does have a unique campaign i was surprised by how much i liked yuan bos campaign because i was expecting the changling to be my favorite the reason i am not recommending it is simply price this is ca exploiting the tw community because of their massive screw up with hyenas

#####

once again do not buy this we should expect more from these developers that we have seen from them in the past this in unacceptable and they ca should be ashamed

#####

i meani used to get more for my money with this game but i do feel like ca listened to the community and took a step in the right direction so im throwing down my 25 bucks to encourage this behavior good dog ca

#####

i initially didnt plan to get this dlc but someone gifted it to me so i can update my mod with the new ll and units
the dlc is way too expansive compared to content
there are not a tons of units as announced but just a few ones including ror which are not really new units the few we have are relatively interesting for cathay but for kislev they ar not that good the ashkina feel out of theme and the monsters are strange to have in regular armies

the mechanism for the ll seems to be fun but i really dont like how mother ostyanka and yuan bo starts far from home
i could understand a kind of random start to increase replayability and having sometime a ll in a mission far away but as it is now having ll starting a bit everywhere kind of dilute the immersion for me

naggoroth is not really de with too many other races starting here for example

and we still have way too many bugs even if ca seems to make some effort recently its still too little too slow

maybe if ca increase the pace of bug corrections and come back to more solid content and gameplay ill change the review later

as it is now i would not recommend the dlc at least not at this price i think its worth 1618 




#####

refunding horribly overpriced doesnt fix a bunch of longstanding bugs and introduces a slew of new one the promised overhauls turned out to be minor changes at best

ca continues to show they dont care about the game or their playerbase i recommend voting with your wallet

#####

price wise you arent getting much content out of this dlc compared to a dlc like the chaos dwarfs you are getting about half the content as this is more of an addon to cathay kislev and tzeentch i have had some fun playing the changeling however i dont know if i would call it 25 of fun its concerning seeing such a price increase compared to previous lord packs as next time they drop a whole race pack it could cost as much as a whole game which is terrible for the health of the game i have plenty of friends i feel would love to try out total war but they already have problems committing to an expensive game like this and with the drastic increase i worry that it will simply tip the scales so much that we wont get any new players once they see the absurd costs for what is really a minuscule amount of content

please total war i love your games and your legacy the first games i ever played on a pc was the original medieval total war back in 2002 and diablo 2 when i was a mere child and have been an avid fan of both ever since im already devastated that the diablo series has been monetized so much that it now feels like a group of people design the new games around milking as much money as possible and forgot what its like to create a fun game i dont want to see the total war series go down the same route

treat this like a learning moment short term thinking like this tends to fail long term

#####

creative assembly actually listened they fired their product director and doubled the amount of content in this dlc things are looking much more positive now  hopefully this trend continues

my original negative review

i only bought this because i had 28 off total on the humble store landing me the dlc for 1439 rather than 1999 at the price i paid its expensive but at a point that id consider it just about okay considering i love warhammer i wouldnt pay 1999 for this  wait until either a sale or ca decides to add muchneeded content to the dlc i cant see them reducing the price

putting aside comments about price and lack of content as this is very well covered elsewhere frankly what ca has done here is simply bad business video gaming is a luxury market  and like all luxuries  given a choice between eating paying gaselectricity and video games people are going to choose to not buy your video games  or instead buy products that offer far more value for the money paid and there are plenty of those right now  bg3 and armored core iv just to name two

ca has only has two sane business choices frankly 

1 add more content to this dlc so that it warrants the price some of which is easy to add how hard is it to reskin two lords for goodness sake

2 reduce the price of future equivalent dlcs by 2030 and maintain the current amount of content

businesses rely on customer goodwill throw it away and you can watch your market and your company sink in the process

#####

decent but overpriced

#####

overpriced

#####

an honest review its a long one guys so sorry in advance 

ive bought every dlc for the total war warhammer franchise on release and have literally thousands of hours across all 3 games ive bought the steel case collectors editions for all 3 and just love the games in general
ive completed all the new lords campaigns and heres my take 

yuan bo  the worst of the lot this guy could honestly have been given out as  flc the campaign just seemed rushed almost as an afterthought with the final battle being very underwhelming the mechanics stone  steel didnt do much to improve the faction or make them really stand out from the other cathay factions and the new units should really have been included as part of the original faction onyx crowmen are a nice early flyer unit and the wardrum is a pretty good buff unit but its not enough 

the changling  i actually enjoyed this faction the mechanics are interesting and the campaign seemed well thought out and put together the schemes are fun to complete and you do actually have that im a criminal mastermind feeling when everything comes together im glad they chose to add aekold in as a flc as tzeentch are lacking in strong melee heroes  lords although this is usually made up for by their devastating magic potential my only gripe with the faction is the extra units these should have been included as part of a flc or the original faction tzangors are a nice early melee unit but they are quickly replaced with warriorschosen of tzeentch 

mother ostankya  not baba yaga was another fun faction to play they have a difficult start not being able to recruit most of the kislev roster until you control one of the major cities kislev erengrad or praag but even without bear riders or tzar guard the new units are enough to hold their own i enjoyed the things in the woods and akshina ambushers this is the only faction where the new units actually felt like they belonged in a dlc although we could maybe have used a few more rather than recycle drychas spiders  feral bears they add a nice touch to the kislev roster and allow for a wider variety of playstyles in battle the campaign was fun even though i had to start again as my original play was bugged and wouldnt unlock the first ritual hex 

so to sum up the dlc was honestly a mixed bag some good elements and some bad 

it saddens me to say but i wouldnt recommend it at full price but certainly on sale when i look back at some of the other full race packs with unique mechanics we had in the past chaos dwarfs tomb kings vampire counts and for the same price or cheaper im hit with a sense of regret 

i dont like review bombing as it does potentially put off new players and i would always recommend the total warhammer series to new players or fans of the other total war series but i hope with the next dlc thrones of decay we see ca go back and up the game to the level we know they can reach

#####

come on ca i get that you need to turn a profit but 25 is too much

#####

bad price more bugs patches coming not when they have something to sell but each new dlc brings more bugs i dont know what happened to the team behind wh1 and 2 but if its the same individuals making decisions they absolutely have lost their mind pick it up only if you want to own all dlc and find a deep discount

#####

free is a good price for this dlc

#####

i bought this dlc because it had some cool toys in it that i really wanted to play with and im greedy and in a way i think i can see people getting value in a dollar to hour sense if thats how you value things but at the end of the day i think its most fair to compare it to what other content is available and honestly its a bit of a rip off im not well versed in warhammer lore but i have heard talk of desire for a lore of hags and a hag lord for kislev i dony know if this would be enough to bridge the gap and make it worth the asking price compared to previous downloadable content but i think it would have gone a long way

#####

credit where its due ca did add new units in the patch 42 for owners of the dlc but still no chicken legged hut mount for ostankya even with the increased price point what a shame

#####

overpriced simple as that

#####

its simply not worth its price if you are not interested in these three lords it does not introduce any interesting or cool units to their races
also 13 of this dlc is literally unplayable
do not spend more than 9 on this one

#####

although still a steep price point for a simple dlc the content is now worth a look due to the recent 42 update log ca has in recent years stepped away from what i always believed to be a consumer positive business model they have favored the profit margin based primarily through asset flips pharaoh and quick cash grabs winds of change that have caused me to take my dollars elsewhere i hope that with the update 42 we will see subsequent dlc and game releases that return to the ca of years past providing engaging content well worth its price point even if it is a few months after launch

#####

i love your game so much and ive had so much fun with it but if this trend continues with this kind of obvious greed with mid quality and low level of new content compared to your previous packs you are severely damaging your brand if you dont prove somehow that all of this money is going to the devs which i seriously doubt then this is nowhere near worth the money

#####

not nearly worth the money

#####

didnt even pay for this it was a gift 

would not recommend

stinky ca

#####

i just straight up paid 20 bucks for ca to brick me game
cant get this thing to start after 40 patch that came along with this dlc
support has no clue how to fix it yet so it seems that my entire collection just got bricked 3 games worth of dlcs 
dope

#####

lies of a tone of units only 12 same prise as chaos dwarfs that had 30 units dont buy
they have added more to it now so iv changed my review

#####

honestly i wasnt expecting too much getting it but i am pleasantly surprised the most common argument i see against it is ofcourse the pricing secondly there only being 3 lords and a handful of units that quite clearly dont sum up to 20 euro the price of this dlc seems to stem from the ridicilous amount of quest battles you get which i kind of like 

the changeling gets like seven unique and honestly pretty fun quest battles throughout the regions not counting his personal and actual quest battles which include getting a staff from quarreling imperials and dwarves or recruiting helbrass by helping him beat beastmen at his monolith 

ostankya gets atleast fourfive quest battles i havnt gotten too far in her campaign but assuming she has to do one quest per hex in her campaign then she got quite a bit of quest battles herself 

yuan bo i dont even know as i havnt gotten to him yet but i can imagine he got quite a few quest battles of his own 

i hope i am wrong because who the hell doesnt adore more units added to rosters but it would appear as if they are sacrificing the quantity of units for the quality of quest battles i adore quest battles one of the best features total war has done in my opinion but i am not all too sure if its really worth it 

as fun as the quest battles are it would still be preferable to sacrifice half of the quest battles just for a more unique and fun roster of units id even ask for more lords but realisitcally there barely is any room left on the map

#####

im disappointed ca more content or lower price next time please not worth buying at full price

#####

just gonna put this here for context when this dlc came out it basically had the content their normal dlcs had for twice the price people didnt like this sudden increase in price and logically voiced their opinion on the matter this ended up with a terrible response from ca which ended up getting them in trouble this is also why the dlc has very negative review score 

since then they have went back on their statement and updated the dlc with a lot more content that previously wasnt there is the dlc worth the price now i think it has definetly redeemed itself in content for the price and i hope ca has learned a valuable lesson from this with that being said this is now a thumbs up for me

#####

watching ca crash and burn because execs are so out of touch with reality that they cant hide how hideously corpulent they are certainly warms this cold ones heart

#####

literally over double the price of a lord pack from wh2 with somehow less content as someone who bought all the dlc from wh2 and 3 the day of launch this is the last ill be buying anything they release at full price

wait for a deep sale at least 60 off the changeling is a 1010 but yuan bo is the definition of mid and mother stanky is 100 garbage

#####

shadows of change is by far the least worthwhile dlc in the total warhammer lineup 
the price is not worth it for the items received ill go over each of the characters a bit 
for a general review however it is not worth the price each lord alone with their units should be priced at

changeling 8 usd
mother ostankya 5 usd
yuan bo 5 usd
max total together 15 usd  25 usd

the changeling 
interesting new take on a unique campaign style i like it but it quickly gets old when you realize you are essentially unable to be defeated even with ramping the campaign up to legendary the changeling is almost impossible to lose with on top of this when you use the main aspect of this character to transform into another lord you show up without unique mounts or items i understand this from a lore perspective but from game play it boils down to you just shape shifting into skarbrand or belekor 247 it becomes super redundant and boring the units for tzeentch in this dlc are actually quite nice i like them a lot but there is only a few doesnt feel like enough to justify more then 8 bucks for this lord and his army especially when the cockatrice unit is bugged and essentially just stands around hopefully it will be fixed soon the blue scribes hero is great though that was a great addition a little overpowered though probably will be nerfed eventually 

mother ostankya 
i was actually pleasantly surprised with mother stank she is dripping with personality and character she is also a powerful legendary lord that is where the good ends though her campaign sucks terrible start position to use any kislev unit other than base level stuff you have to take one of the big three kislev cities or have a military alliance with kislev butyou start in nagarothwho decided this it would have been fine if they actually put any effort into mother stanks units or faction she gets three new units like tzeentch which are pretty cool but you are basically stuck with those three units and some spiders and bats till usually turn 70 or so when you can get in contact with kislev realistically on the bright side they made her three new units unbelievably overpowered im talking some of the most broken units in the series lol that doesnt make up for it being a boring campaign especially when they nerf those units in the future overall it feels like wasted potential no hagmother leaders no lore of hags just a cool lord and some overpowered chaos units repurposed for kislev 

yuan bo 
honestly i have played the least amount with yuan bo he seems fine so far he is a very powerful legendary lord the execute mechanic is really really good i dont quite know why they made it so good the new units are basically meh the new generic lord type is meh its not bad there just isnt alot there and it didnt really hook me in at all just feels like something cathay needed but alot more of 

aekold helbrass 
i am including this character even though he is free dlc because he most certainly is attached to this dlc by the hip he is a great character and i like him alot one massive issue however since getting the free lc and dlc i have played 3 chaos campaigns in all three i recruited aekold in 2 out of the 3 campaigns he spawns in without his legendary itemsso he doesnt have his breath of life ability or wind blade ability it really knee caps him doesnt matter if i reload an older save and redo the battle either it seems when you start the campaign it decides if aekold will get his stuff or not without his legendary items he is just a chaos hero with a sword very mid it is unbelievable that we are dealing with this level of bugs on the one minuscule thing they gave us for free how can you not polish a single tiny hero character i know i am drilling into a free character a bit much but they killed free legendary lords for this new legendary hero idea it has a much smaller scope then the free lords of the past yet they are way buggier with more issues it just needs to be said that ca is putting less effort into their work i believe it comes down to the dev team not having the resources and manpower to do what they used to thats an upper management issue not a dev issue 

final thoughts 
i think that this 25 usd price point is the new price point for the future 3 lord dlc format that is fine i dont mind the price and alot of people will buy it on sale what i do mind is spending 25 usd on nothing i feel like id get more out of 25 bucks of mcdonalds i fucking hate mcdonalds for the future dlc please please please just put more effort into it more units better units actually make faction mechanics make generic lords please we need generic lords im afraid for the empire dwarf and nurgle rework they need it arguably the most and i feel like they will get absolutely nothing i love total war so much and i want this game to do well but if thrones of decay is similar in scope to this dlc then i absolutely will not be buying it if you want to charge me chaos dwarf money thats fine give me chaos dwarf quality then

#####

ca demands more money for delivering less on their part

#####

tbh its not that bad after the additional content given after the launch

#####

the dlc is mostly okay i guess the tzeentch and cathay changes and new lords are pretty good with fun mechanics and new units

kislev is an absolute disgrace though ostyanka got nothing no lore of hags no new lord type its just inexcusable 

even with the poor kislev showing id recommend this if it was like 10 at the current price though no thanks

#####

much better content for price after the update would recommend dlc when on sale

#####

lords and units are cool i guess but for the price point for the amount of content this is a slap in the face of the fanbase we used to receive so much more for less money add onto that the implication that we purchase this or they stop support for the game is a punch on top of the slap

#####

like i said  

more people just like kneeling and no dignity

every players send money to ca will become an idiot including me it will make ca more shameless  very sad

资本家不抗惯

#####

with 42 this dlc is actually pretty solid for the price still more expensive than id like but overall not bad

#####

ca has fallen

#####

still trash

#####

currently terrible value but the devs promised changes will change the recommendation if the promises are met

#####

got discounted at the price i wouldve paid if ca was a good company mid dlc at best made terrible with pricing

#####

props to ca for owning up to their mistake and listening to the community by adding more content to better fit the price point cautiously optimistic for the future of tw3

#####

chaos dwarfs were somewhat lacking in content compared to previous faction packs but this really takes the cake its eight euros more expensive than the previous lord pack and adds barely anything it indeed costs just as much as said chaos dwarf dlc which at least added an entirely new faction and had the excuse of novelty to it this adds what feels like three units to each of the factions and three lords there are also no significant changes or meaningful freelc which used to come with these lord packs previously
an absolute travesty 25 is far too good for this

#####

after the update to the provided content the dlc is now a decent pickup

#####

only buy on discount they are charging way too much for this dlc i might change this if they give ostankya witch lords so her armies of spooky deep woods critters arent lead by aristocrats

#####

i like the content quite a bit but this is overpriced for what it is

#####

gotta admit on release it was pretty underwhelming but with the new update adding the much needed content i can say you guys really redeemed yourselves love the dlc hopefully we can expect all the upcoming dlcs to just have all of the content at the start ready to go

#####

overexpensive tiny dlc that adds barely anything for 25 do not buy if you dont want to waste your money on a bad company that grinds every dollar out of their community

no hagwitch lords

210

#####

striking this grudge off my book it has been settled

#####

terrible value for the price we knew inflation was going to cause some price increase as it has been with all games

but this is sudden and complete overkill over 150 markup value for the same value you get from 10 warhammer 2 dlc especially if you consider that we often got 3 lords in that game the third one would just be free not paid 

this increase is like if base price 60 titles jumped to 90 instead of 70 it is certainly overpriced

dont blame the devs or community managers blame the corpos and execs that dont hire a custodian team to polish the game dont give the devs enough time and resources and despite putting in way less investment than in wh2 decide its time to drive up prices up by 50 and then proceed to tell community managers to bury their heads in the sand while the community screams from the void

check out the workshop for this game after the mods update to the new patch modders despite having less resources make better patches and add a ton of new units

wait for sale or for them to do something about the dlcs content value the dlc itself is still good but is missing things and definitely isnt worth almost half the price of the full game if you can derive more personal value from it i do then do what you want with your money absolutely buy it if its worth it for you yippee

#####

low content
high price

#####

ehhhh ok look i know there is a lot of mass down voting going on justifiably so but im going to try and give an informed review without just complaining about price 

so if money isnt an issue for you than should you get this dlc yes only if you are interested in the changelings mechanics honestly his mechanics and gameplay are so fun and unique it carries this dlc heavily if you are a tzeentch fan you are already playing and enjoying this dlc this lord is so entirely different and fun from the rest of the game it almost justifies the price alone 

however for you cathay fans this is ok as yuan bo is sort of different from his dragon siblings enough to justify a new lord but it isnt the highlight is steel and stone mechanic while basic gives good buffs and gives you a reason to expand 

and for you kislev hag fans i am so so so sorry no lore of hags a small handful of early units with one being a chaos creature which makes no sense lore wise and a half baked lord mechanic which takes from groms cooking mechanic and not even well 

if money is an issue wait for a sale if you love tzeetch or are really interested in this id say 20 is slightly overpriced but worth it for the changeling for cathay fans id say 15 is good enough and for kislev and the rest just pass this by as you guys got the short end 

in short tldr get this now or on a sale if you are a fan of tzeentch deep sale if you are a fan of cathay and skip all together if you are a fan of kislev the reason i dont recommend is because of the specific scenarios for it to be good that likely the vast majority of people who will look at this dlc probably should not get it

#####

i accept your surrender

joking but not entirely so many companies have died on the hill of their pride and i appreciate ca not just acknowledging their missteps in recent months but actively moving to make things right before just moving on to the next thing  lesser companies would simply throw what theyve done under the bus and say theyll change things going forward

its not perfect and it would have been better to get it right in the first place  but few things are and groups are no more immune to making mistakes than individuals for those on the inside who fought for the consumer until the bitter end i salute you

#####

come on people these prices are outrageous weve recieved much more content for much cheaper not a good luck ca marketing

#####

i love this game but buying this dlc was a big mistake 

#####

dlcs used to be 10 for 2 lords and they would release a free lord every now and then as well they also did 4 lord sets for 18 25 for 3 lords is dogshit

#####

much more reasonable amount of content for the price now

#####

no not even on sale

the content isnt anywhere near what you pay

the changeling probably the only truly unique lord out of the three stooges while he didnt come with any new units he handles the campaign map differently constructing hidden trickster cults basically a chaos flavored undercity or pirate cove meaning you dont have any territory to defend or more likely lose he can also change into any legendary lordhero that you defeat or ally with lending their combat styles and abilities to your faction

mother ostankya a silly lord with a silly name her starting position in both campaigns is abysmal her roster is stripped of every kislev unit except for her unique ones requiring either direct control of or alliances with the factions that control the main kislev cities she also has a stripped down version of drychas beast roster spidershatchlings grizzlypolar bears and bats because of course she has bats who doesnt at this point she also lacks immunity to chaos waste attrition despite fighting chaos being her whole reason for existing

yuan bo the weakest in the trio if youve played cathay youve played yuan bo he doesnt bring anything new to the cathay faction he has access to unique directions on the compass but you have to grind for these he can also see the regions of factions hes trading with  an ability that im pretty sure was copied from another total war game but i dont remember which

in short this content is lazy and overpriced 


#####

launched bad but then they fixed it better late than never i guess

#####

the new dlc and new dlc format is not worth the price they are charging not even close despite some good creativity in here along with them increasing all the prices for the previous stuff over the last 8 years of wh1 and wh2 reduction of actual content compared to previous and much cheaper lord packs and eradication of a free lord for everyone to enjoy its just not good enough with it being heavily bugged on all 3 lord fronts half baked in many areas and the game is in similar declining stability state as a junkies carpet 

ca need to do better but i do believe they will not

#####

everything in its great but not for 25 usd 15 usd was normal price for lord packs in wh1 and 2 if they switched the price 20 or even 18 usd itd be nicer and maybe one more unit or even just one extra hero for each love the game ca but not the price edit  new content is nice

#####

played all 3 factions for about 3 hours not only is it overpriced but its simply not fun

#####

not actually as terrible as people say but the response from the company was so ridiculous that it cant be recommended although if you want to play cathay is pretty good also the kislev addition is so random and weird why is she on another continent than her homeland thankfully mods can fix that

#####

bought at 20 discount with the belief that ca will add requested addition to shadows of change to compensate for the high price 

add more to soc and i will remove the negative review if not i will never buy another cas product again youre on your last leg ca understand that

#####

updated after content update of feb 24 2024 they basically doubled the stuff in this dlc and the updates are solid especially the lore of hags is completely unique and interesting its not perfect  the chaos dwarfs dlc still offers the best value when compared to this  but now it doesnt feel outright insulting if you like any of these races it definitely adds to them significantly


old launch review good stuff but not enough of the good stuff for the premium price tag
this dlc has like 6070  of the content you would expect for this kind of money in 2023

only buy if youre a desperate tww3 superfan loser like me

#####

however this is the business reality of supporting warhammer iii and ensuring were able to offer the years of extra content that are currently planned

#####

not worth it right now not even with a discount

#####

hey steam it seems you made a mistake about developer by accident probably

instead of ea you put ca



#####

i love twwh3  its an understatement to say that its my favorite game of the past 23 years  i have more hours into this game than just about any other game of my life  ive purchased all dlc since i started playing this game but im sitting this one out  the price increase is too egregious the quality is too poor and the state of the game is inadequate  a lower price might have influenced me to purchase but but this is just too much  25 is not a big deal for me and i want to play this dlc badly but ca needs to try harder to get my future business  

great game with poor leadership

#####

the price point is not worth it for the amount of content added in this dlc 

furthermore the amount of lack of polish bugs and other terrible gameplay mechanics in the base game are just compounded by what they have added in this dlc

25 for a dlc is a crazy price for 3 legendary lords and 12 units the chaos dwarves dlc is less than this and is a whole new faction

fix your game add more units to this dlc retroactively and then we can talk about this price point

#####

i only bought this dlc for the changeling and although i personally think his campaign is good and a bit of relaxed nonnonsensical fun if you ignore the bugs and the fact that he definitely needs to be nerfed a bit i could not care less for the other two lords within the dlc and it feels odd that to play the one faction i wanted to i now had to buy not just one but two additional lords i took a quick look at ostyankas roster and felt immediate disappointment with there only being the three dlc units she can recruit and bears and spiders instead of making something unique yet samey like they did with drycha they opted to take the lazy route and just add some existing beasts and call it a day not to mention no hag lords i have not looked at yuan bo at all but from what i understand he is alright it is quite obvious that the changeling got most of the love while ostyanka feels like a last minute idea this dlc feels rushed just to reach the summer release date on their development map but at the same time it feels odd that it even was rushed considering the time they had to develop it suggesting that for some reason they are understaffed which of course bodes well for any future dlc lastly the price is definitely not worth the dlc not unless they add more content to it with some time though i doubt they will i would have accepted if it was 20 eurosdollars as it makes sense to have each lord cost 5 and then an additional 5 due to the ongoing crisis but instead not only is the price increase unreasonable but the quality is very lacking giving me the feeling that all this money is instead going into the development of pharaoh hyenas and a third total war title which is currently in the making in the future just buy it on sale or get keys honestly

#####

ca seems willing to try and improve so far so good my optimism is slowly returning

#####

the dlc would be great if it was 1499 too over priced for what you get wait for a sale

#####

first pass of this dlc was terrible it asked too much for too little the players myself included boycotted and change was made the dlc now provides what i feel is value for asked price and i love the additions that were added i appreciate the style of many units especially the latter editions like the celestial lions and i appreciate that the changeling was given a very unique playstyle true to their character

my only negative now is that the factions involved in the dlc also realistically needed a racecampaign pass to be up to speed for example cathay caravans being made to be more on par with the far superior chaos dwarf caravans

#####

this was a difficult offering to defend upon release but with the additional units now there is no argument for low value on this dlc 3 very unique campaigns with lots of new and interesting units to use i feel confident youll be happy with this dlc if youre a fan of the series

#####

overpriced and underdelivered

#####

edited review at the end i left the original one because these were my feelings at release

i just got it cause i lack self control and cant help making bad financial decisions

cant recommend what you get for it isnt worth the price 

if you really want it wait for a good discount and i mean a good one not 2030 and even then you are paying what is really is worth

____________

now with the update is worth the price still be smart and get it on discount still the changeling campaign gets old fast only played it once before update dont really se a reason to play it again i like the new units though
had more fun with ostankia and yuan bo especially now that ostankia has her new lore of magic

#####

at last i can recommend this dlc its value is reflected by the price
pros
extremely cool cathay additions overall
tzeentchian units in both early and strong late game monsters
great unique lord in the changling
beastmen gets to enjoy a lot of added tzeentch additions

negatives
quite pricey
3 factions dlc so you better like all three


#####

really bad value all around i wouldnt recommend this dlc as it doesnt really add that much and surely isnt worth the money get it on a big sale or skip it

#####

the good
 quality on par with other dlc releases what is added here is fun and useful animations and models are cool
 the celestial general lord for cathay is pretty baller i didnt realize how badly they needed a proper melee lord until they got one
 the blue scribes legendary hero theyre gamblinghero and its hilarious
 the changeling is amazing

the bad
 like every dlc since maybe the second half of wh2  its extremely buggy even the very modest bugfixing targets for this release were not completed and as usual several new bugs were introduced if you want specifics look it up on youtube it wont be hard to find
 barely any generic lordsheroes historically a lord pack had at least 1 generic lord and hero for each faction here you get 1 generic lord celestial general and 1 generic hero hag witch total with 3 factions represented clearly ca thought adding the blue scribes absolved them of having to make generic characters it does not
 not really their fault per se but this update dramatically flips the balance of power on the map back toward order every theatre of war except nehekhara will flip to one of the order races every time even the chaos wastes themselves now that kislev has been encouraged to go there playing an order race has become much easier

the ugly
 the massive price hike shadows of change is essentially if im being generous given the lack of generic characters 15 lord packs in the past these were 10 each and apparently this was enough to fund their whole studio for years on the same pricing scheme this dlc should be worth 15 theyre pleading poverty and thus chose to hike prices and i guess thats fair a simple 45 increase 20 would have caused some grumbling but i think most people would have swallowed it instead they chose to make a whopping 10 increase there is no justification for this you want to tell me overhead has doubled for this game since wh2
 the statement if youve been following the socials and promo for this game youll have heard about this but ca put out a statement about the price increase tldr our costs are up so were raising the price the problem line is this one
theres no good time to increase prices and we have not taken this step lightly however this is the business reality of supporting warhammer iii and ensuring were able to offer the years of extra content that are currently planned 
people understandably took this as a threat to cancel the game if people dont pay their inflated prices no matter how you look at it thats a scummy move especially after they abandoned three kingdoms

conclusion whats on offer here is good and par for the course in terms of quality its the quantity and unreasonably inflated price that makes shadows of change a thumbs down do not buy full price unless you are swimming in cash

#####

wait for a sale at least 50 percent off the accompanying patch is fine from what ive played of it but theres not enough content to justify the price

#####

overpriced

#####

i thought i was on crazy pills here why was nobody talking about the bugged changeling hide trait his armies are supposed to be hidden in regions with trickster cult buildings thats what the trait says yet constantly it does not trigger with the parasitic income building i cant believe this was never caught maybe well get lucky with a fix in december kekw 

also pricing we will never get a 15 dlc anymore 20 or above mark my words greed

also starting tip for changeling the hero you get from your first mission bring it over to castle drakenhof and make a symbiotic income building that thing will give you 938 gold per turn at turn 7 then recruit a lord in drakenhof and spread corruption easy scheme done

#####

i am really sorry to write this but i have to express my opinion that is why i have decided to not recommend this

positive
content is great we always appreciate the effort of developers and artists to add new content thank you

negative
 the price there is no reason to overcharge this dlc 250 more than warhammer 1 dlc with the same content inflation has been in uk 25 not 250 this means this dlc should be 1214 not more the only reason i can find to put this price is because you know that pharaon is not going to sell well and you want to minorize the impact in the economic results 
communication terrible if i was in ca rob bartholomew should have been fired after the communication with the veiled threat saying buy this or we will leave creating content for warhammer 3 we are the people who has supported the company for more than 20 years
manners you only said something when the community exploded saying this is enough and you published the communication meanwhile your partners were doing directs
bugs this games has plenty of bugs and you only solve some of them every 6 months even more sometimes you solve 1 thing to break 3 this is not programmers fault is the lack of resources you put in this department i want you to remind you you promised when the game was launch to solve all of them and the performance is still unacceptable in campaign map there is bo reason why a 12th gen i9 with 3080ti cannot have 60fps in 4k 

for this and more i would recommend buying this dlc

#####

this dlc is an odd stain on an otherwise decent record on behalf of ca the content is underwhelming but from the sounds of it the remaining team is at a bare minimum awful business practices lead to this dlc which is not explicitly awful have lead to a price not reflecting the content being added in this dlc no flc content besides a relatively average and forgettable legendary hero is just depressing 

i cannot recommend this dlc unless you are able to get it for 1012 usd or less


edit 1 they fixed the game without any additional costs they did a great amount of work to turn this into a high value dlc

#####

i got it on sale for 17 and thats still probably not worth it overall lacking in content for a dlc of this price mother o isnt much fun to play shes just got groms mechanic changelling is interesting but loses its fun quickly due to no risk of the 3 i really only like yaun bo he has an engaging mechanic and interesting start

edit they have added a good deal of additional content for this dlc id say its now worthwhile around the 1820 price if you can find a sale

#####

the content is not worth the money

#####

first and foremost dont buy this at full price wait for a sale 

with that being said i did like content the dlc had to offer but 25 is a steep price to ask for how buggy the game is while i did not encounter any major bugs the ones that i did find make it abundantly clear that this is not a premium dlc

the changeling an extremely easy but fun campaign that you literally cannot lose you go can where you please and sow chaos however you want this campaign is the highlight of the dlc and is very fun to play the new units have a place in any tzeentch army and you get a lot of use out of them as kairos 810

yuan bo another human faction in lustria to keep alberic and wulfhart company you can play him just a settlement in lustria or try to fight in cathay his campaign isnt too difficult and his starting position lets you fight enemies you wouldnt normally see in cathay still would have preferred yinyin in lustria but the campagn is still fun the crowmen are pretty usefull but the two lions arent that good the general and the wardrum are decent 710

mother ostyanka i really like her starting position however you can only use a small part of kislevs roster and some animal units until you either conquer certain settlements in kislev or ally with a kislevite faction obviously you care going to pick the best unit available to use out of this limited roster and that happens to be akhshina ambushers your early game armies are literally going to consist almost entirely out of them as the most effective unit available to you for the next 3040 turns the hag witches are good heroes but the incarnate elemental and things in the woods arent all that useful 510 i would rate this campaign higher if the roster wasnt so restrictive i had more fun with using the new units with katarin because i could work the new units into the existing roster





#####

there are free mods which add more content than this premium dlc

this is possibly the lowest effort dlc ive seen from the whole trilogy not worth the price the lords have some interesting if unoriginal mechanics however the sheer lack of new units is incredibly disappointing only about 3 or 4 per lord 

how something like this could be placed at the same price as the chaos dwarves which added in an entire new race is beyond me although the worst part is that these three races will likely now have to wait literal years to receive any more units it feels like modders are the only ones keeping this game alive at the moment back to the workshop i go

#####

over costed do not buy unless on sale

#####

how to kill your company 101 even if you dont own or turn off the dlc you have to deal with the changeling you cannot kill

#####

overpriced game and dlc and at the same time full of bugs this is not a quality product this is just a consumer ripoff

#####

fvck ca 

update ca is trying to fix this dlc with more content they need to keep this amount of content launched with the dlc not months later we shall see with thrones of decay

#####

shameful display

#####

what it does
 provides unique storyobjective campaigns for both realms of chaos and immortal empires each with unique mechanics separate to their race
 provides 5 units unique herolord hero type lord type for each race

pros
 i enjoy the shared focus in story for both realms of chaos and immortal empires though i think realms of chaos should be more on the backburner and immortal empires the focus on story
 i appreciate that it was able to get relooked at providing standardization of unit content across the factions this style of dlc seems like an improvement in quality and quantity from previous dlc after its update

middle
 although it cost as much as a new race i think it is a diverse package of goodeffort units with better designed mechanics compared to previous dlc champions of chaos

cons
 initial release was a bad costunit ratio

#####

sadly you need this for some mods

#####

uninspired overpriced no significant rework of any faction no fixes for significant bugs  issues the worst possible follow up they could do after the last dlc 


#####

overpriced and underfilled like an empty breast implant



seriously tho dont buy this its not worth it and if you do let ca know what you think of their prices

#####

increase the price of this halfbaked dlc to boost revenue because costs are up but drive lifetime value of a customer to the ground 
b how to destroy a business 101 b

#####

dont get this dlc at full price at 50 off it is priced fairly wait for 75 or more for an actual sale

thank you the friends that gifted me this dlc though

#####

this is the first dlc for this game  that after playing a few hours i stopped the amount of new things this dlc adds is minimal compared to past dlcs i do not know what they were thinking pricing this at 25 with the reduction of content for now i would not recommend buying this wait 1 year for all the bugs to be fixed and price to drop to 1299

#####

this dlc while being the most expensive brought very little fresh and or exicting content the campaigns and the new units feel rushed and implementing the fantasiesideas behind the new content seems only half baked 
in a bit more detail yes the changeling has an interesting game mechanic but the implementation of the ideas behind it is awful to throw the empire into civil war you basically have to win so many battles that when done efficiently there is very little of the empire left in the first place might just raze the few remaining settlements and be done with it
similarly with mother ostankya the fantasy of protecting kislev out of the dark creepy woords just doesnt come to live instead it feels like a reskin of an already existing dlc and flc grom the paunch  drycha thrown into some random corner of the map where by the time you get to protect kislev you can count yourself lucky if it still exists
also the additional units feel rushed in a sense that yes they are powerful and yes they look great however they are op in a way that it feels unsatisfactory using them like using cheats which takes the fun out of battles as well
i really tried to get some enjoyment out of the content but ultimately i cant get myself to immerse myself into an experience that feels like it needed more time to mature and be more fleshed out  thinking about the high price this is really not worth it which is a shame

#####

overpriced  shallow dlc models and animations are great but the rest falls on the modding community to flesh out and keep this game alive  interesting

#####

this is a fun dlc for sure however the amount of content that it comes with is not worth the price ca is asking for it  i am all for paying 25 for a dlc but if that is the case ca needs to give 25 worth of dlc forge of the chaos dwarfs was the same price as this but compare the two of them a race pack vs a lord pack i dont understand why ca thinks this would be worth the same price if you like total war and their dlcs you will most likely enjoy this as well if you can justify the 25 for this game it is your money use it when you need it but me personally i would say wait for a sale i really hope going forward this is not the new price for lord packs cause that means i will be waiting for sales vs being able to play them on day one

#####

overpriced only bought cause im impatient and want to play changeling

#####

i was not interested in buying this dlc until i saw the 42 update log just knowing ca is interested in patching things up with the community already sets them apart from many other companys i hope they dont forget that this game has a loyal community that is happy to buy multiple dlcs and all they ask for in return is just a consistent level of quality and quantity
personally i have played these games since the first release back in 2016 so almost 8 years with this game and now that ca has admitted that they did not deliver on this dlc gives me hope for the future of the game there is still a way to go though sieges are still not very fun past turn 100 there isnt much of a challenge as the player has snowballed too much the ai is still extremely bad at battles building armys using magic and they have no chance in sieges ok im done rambling i would recommend purchasing this dlc

#####

in spite of how interesting and fun changeling is to play and how cool some of the new units are it doesnt excuse the exorbitant price hike that this dlc is asking for and the utter lack of content that is in it compared to other similarly priced dlc packs for crying out loud for the same price this dlc asks you for you could buy almost any other rts game that is probably more competently designed than this one or buy the chaos dwarfs dlc which while still having its problems is still an entire bloody faction race instead of 3 new legendary lords and a few units

dont buy this at full price or at all if you can resist it spite ca for what theyre doing and have been doing and teach them how stupid it is to threaten your own customers
