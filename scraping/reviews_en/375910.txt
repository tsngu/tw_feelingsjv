i am a long time fan of anno games it is my favorite game franchise ive been waitng for years for the next anno release having loved anno 2070 i knew the next one would be awesome i was hoping for space so so hoping for space   and then anno 2205 came out i read the negative reviews and i told myself it couldnt be that bad i waited for it to go on sale where as i paid full price for anno 2070 just in case i would regret the full price tag even so even at the high discounted rate i was disappinted even after reading all the bad reviews playing anno 2205 and experiencing it myself was such a huge let down everything i loved about anno games is gone its so dumbed down no more resource management or careful production planning no more map creation all gone just plop buildings down whereever build a road and sit its stupid mindless and boring is this supposed to be a console game a tablet game what it certainly isnt a pc game even the map is annoying no more random maps no more panning map view able to just pan over to other islands or catch whales swimming or watch shpis now all map areas are in different screens with loading wait times no more little details that made the worlds seem like well real worlds no more micromanaging resources and planning supply chains or careful map lay out  all that is gone now you just drop in farms as whole units no more warehouses all you need is a road no more sea battles in the old sense now it is a sperate battle screen that takes yuo completely out of the game there is not one games worth of play here let alone playing again and again and again like i have previous anno versions ive played and replayed anno 2070 and others for years no more looks like im done with anno yet another awesome pc game franchise killed

#####

it is the first time i am writing a review but considering what the game is as a old fan of the anno games i feel like i have to

first i must say i cant blame the devs for trying to renew the series i dont see how they could have added good things to the mechanics of the previous games without changing what is already in place so i think change was necessary the devs did too and so it went

however what we ended up with is an empty game or rather a collection of loosely connected minigames but in any case nothing as deep as any of its predecessors it is all child play 
basically you are just filling the map with buildings until you run out of space if you manage to not get bored to death before it doesnt really matter where and how as long as it is in the right sector connected to a road and preferably as close as possible to the service producing buildings it requires or the other way around if it is a service building you are placing as for the kind of building basically you start with some houses then you go on with service buildings and factories until your stock manager says production meets consumption there are no trading routes you just select the type of good the source the destination the transfer rate you want and you are done also you dont really need trading routes so much in the first place because you can produce anything in any sector as long as it is a sector of the right biome at some point you may need some rare materials to get these you will have to either do some quests move your main only ship around the current sector do a crisis sector some sort of donjon crawler with boats totally independent from the main game i dont really understand what it thinks its doing here maybe it stand as a reminder of the fact that the previous games had a military aspect or play the asteroid miner android game
there is just no mechanic in that game that is not trivial to master

i understand why some of the mechanics have been removed by replacing the carts and boats with abstractions of themselves you end up with something that from any meaningful perspective behaves the same way but only uses a fraction of the resources the original requires to run which in turn allow the devs to make things huge but then despite all the potential offered by this approach it looks like they went for the cheapest solutions why did you have to make trading routes so dumb why did you have to remove the fertility mechanic given that these two things could have been there was it so hard to replicate the random maps with sectors instead of islands sadly no
the devs made room for new things and gave themselves great tools and then did nothing with them so thats what the game ended up full of nothing


so to new comers i would say save your money buy anno 2070 instead you will get way more for a much lower price the anno game series is definitely one of the great names of its genre and 2205 tried to renew it but it fails to create anything worthy of your time and money as far as gameplay is concerned

#####

the older anno games have hundreds of hours of replay value especially with their random map generators this game has one big storyline lasting a few hours which offers you nothing really interesting when youre done with it all the city locations are the same in each playthrough all the missions will be the same in each playthrough and theres not even a skirmish mode to bring anything new to each game they got rid of it completelyalong with manual saves for some reason

you also no longer get to trade withdeclare war on your competitors they dont even have any cities present on the map they offer you missions with small rewards from time to time as well as sector project missions but the only trading done is with a neutral space station that happens to have every resource available the only combat is done against some really generic villain who declared the moon independent for some reason the only representation of your competitors as actual competition is found in a bar graph showing whos got the highest corporation rating based on the total population managed by each corporationthough their people doesnt really exist anywhere youre the only one with an actual simulated population

theres no downside to being below your competitors other than their constant smug comments that you suck

its an anno game so its still pretty fun to just manage your cities and build your production chains and i love how you can finally see the supplyconsumption rates of your city at a glance but i wouldnt recommend getting this one over the older games it doesnt offer anything particularly new and removes a bunch of good staple features of the anno series

buy the older games if youre interested theyre cheaper and last longer

#####

anno 2205 brings a lot of change to the anno franchise unfortunately not all of them have been thought through 

let me start with some good changes the economy system has been changed inside a sector the need of establishing trade routes has been removed power build force and resources are automatically transferred between different islands however the concept of trade routes is not gone entirely it has been shifted to the world view where you can exchange needed resources between sectors 

also thanks to the fact that the game now displays resource and goods output per building and also per sector it has become a lot easier to create such routes 

a lot of reviews claim that the system of storage on an islandsector is gone this is not true overproduction is still being sent to the warehouse and you can still monitor it by hovering your mouse over the goods item in the sector overview found in the lower left corner of your hud in sector view it will still fullfill the needs of your residents if the sector output drops to the negative however if you have negative output and build new production lines to fullfill that need it will increase resident satisfaction instantly instead of slowly charging up like in the previous games 

what is gone from the game is the ability to load overproduction onto your ship at will you still do this for missions i am also still searching for a per sector breakdowm of my inhabitants and more importantly free living space this among other function the anno regular might be used to seems to be either removed or tied to one of those final monument structures that i have yet to reach

edit scoobydoomydoom mentioned in a comment that you can find your population statistics hidden behind the little people button next to the minimapedit

edit i have encountered a very annoying bug with the public needs buildings and the move structure feature whenever i move resident buildings in order to optimize public needs output to reduce the amount of required public structures the game will calculate the new layout wrong and assign needs deficits when there is actually a huge overproduction strangely enough this bug will sometimes fix itself by closing the game and restarting the map it is quite annoying however to have 150000 investors move out because of a lack of mobility even after creating a 27 surplus around them with sufficient road connections especially when this means your income suddenly takes a death plungeedit

different sectors

right now there exist 3 temperate arcitc and lunar arctic and lunar have special requirements to their building sceme and lunar buildings cost an arm and a leg to build but other than that they mostly add some visual difference rather than gameplay ones your population in temperate regions mostly provides the money for your exploits in the other two sectors so you go back once in a while to up population meanwhile population in the other two sectors is only important to increase your spaceport level to be able to transport goods back to your home region

modules

this is probably the best addition yet for every production building you can make meaningful adjustments in order to increase productivity or reduce maintainance not only that but in different sectors different modules make more sense rule of thumb upgrading a farm is cheaper and puts less strain on your energyincome than building a second farm it also takes up less space and for those mountain and shore spots it is absolutely neccesary in order to get the best out of them

now to the absolute negative combat

i am not sure what to say about it so here a brief description instead of waging war with concurring factions in your own sector the game has a set of crisis sectors where you can duke it out with a preset fleet of ships that can be upgraded and will be expanded as your population grows the gameplay seems like a simple dawn of war 2 clone with varying but similar objectives so far so boring for someone who came to anno after playing rts for years 

the ai is horrible ships patrol in preset sectors you get too close they stick to you like glue until you run away far enough the games trickle down to kill those five ships retreat repair kill those four ships retreat repair while finding the best route to your objective in order to increase the difficulty the amount of ships in the sector is simply raised to the point where you are tiptoeing trough a minefield on hardes settings tedious but not in the slightest challenging 

variation no there are three or four scenarios for each region and they will start repeating soon by repeating i mean very same map with opponents in the very same spot the only reason to do this is to get rare materials that can be used to upgrade your buildings it could have been a smartphone app woud have had more replay value than the app they actually released if not by much 

compared to the excellent combat system in 1404 and the still very god combat system in 2070 this is a joke and a direct insult to my intelligence

the crowning touches is that the only online activity in this game are council votings and trading on the online market

if ubisoft wants a positve review they will need to address

the combat system best you throw it out and do it anew
ship building i want to build my fleet myself and i like my fleets big
multiplayer and by that i mean both coop and competetive

edit according to ubisoft multiplayer is to follow soontm there is no information yet on how exactly this is to work thoughedit

if you want to pull anno out of the garbage before the playerbase vanishes you better get those done not neccesarily quickly but in a well polished and professional manner playable enjoyable

edit minoes claimed that if you were looking for a singleplayer economy building game and did not care about the military part you could safely buy the game i felt that i had to put up a clarification for people like him yes the economy part is done well no it does not make the game a safe deal 

the problem is the replay value the average player will be hitting the last technologies after 15 hours of gameplay adding the sector projects you gain roughly 20 hours of progressive gameplay half of that if you build up a strong economy from the start and do not take up as much time waiting to unlock sectors from other corporations

after that there is pretty much nothing to do other than prettying up your settlement or perfecting your goods chains the 9 sectors currently ingame are pre made with pre made main and side missions and repetetive miniquests this might be great for casual players and people going for the perfect pretty city but even that only became interesting in the prequels because the random islands and their different properties spiced things up 

okay 10 to 20 hours sounds promising to some but in the prequels you spent the same amount of time on your average random map with always changing challenges and opportunities some which you could pick some which the map predefined with a singleplayer campaign and single missions still on top of that and i know i am repeating myself multiplayer support to play together or against each otheredit

edit 05nov2015 fixed a few typos added information on population and multiplayer
edit 06nov2015 response to comments added
edit 14nov2015 ubi announced a fix for random online disconnects

i am a diehard annofan ever since having been enchanted by anno 1602 naturally the newest addition to the franchise anno 2205 by ubisoft blue byte was going to be a definite purchase does it live up to its numerous predecessors

anno 2205 is a logical continuation of anno 2070 2070s main selling point was the new setting but apart from that it stayed very true to the annoformula in which you navigate a large open map filled with randomly generated islands on which to settle optimise your economy care for your citizens needs all while dealing with your npccompetitors or other players online who do the same in real time there always was something magical about starting the game with nothing but a single explorationvessel with some wood and a few tools on board finding a place that suits you and watching it grow until it is thriving and full of life

with anno 2205 ubisoft blue byte seems to attempt to step outside of their own comfortzone there are several radical changes to the old formula no longer do you start the game with a race for the best island in fact the whole concept of the single large oceanmap was done away with alltogether now you get to choose between one of three maps of the temperate zone all of which preconstructed  no more random generation the maps differ slightly in the amount of buildable land and resourcebuildingspots they also all feature a unique set of sidequests  this may be rebuilding an old dam for a massive increase in powergeneration or constructing a monument while the maps still technically feature islands they are much larger in size than they were in previous games and some can even be connected via bridges
so far so good yet that is not where the changes end
no longer do you and the npcs coexist together on the same map instead they automatically occupy the maps you did not choose to build their cities offcamera the only interaction you have with them is through sidequests they issue you occasionally much like in anno 2070 or through the ingamemenu which connects all the zones on a worldmap once you reach certain milestones with your corporation you will gain access to again one of three maps of the arctic region then again to one of three maps on the moon creatively the craters are the islands here both of these regions come with their own challenges your arctic settlers will need to live near factories to stay warm your lunar colonists must be protected from meteorshowers by building shieldgenerators all maps produce unique consumergoods required by the inhabitants of all your three maps so you must have them supplement each other via trading routes
again the three maps are completely seperate from each other but you can access them all through a menu and while you are playing all three will continue simulating in the background

the intention behind all this is according to the devs to let the players focus on what they enjoyed most in anno  building a huge sprawling city with a highly industrious economy granted this is one of annos strongest selling points yet in 2205 this is made so easy for you achieving this seems too trivial to have much of an impact
no longer do you carefully monitor your resources to decide which productionchains need optimising the game flatout tells you exactly how much of a deficit or surplus you are producing the large completely uncontested maps give you more than ample space to plonk down much more than you need to reach the highestlevel citizens so spacemanagement isnt quite as much of an artform anymore either
oh and did i mention the militarypart of the game is now also its very own subgame
instead of having to balance economy and military you now have an offmap fleet given to you at the start of the game which resolves any conflicts you may have much like the maps you build on the game features conflict zones purely for your fleet to do short combatmissions in you will always fight the same enemy this games version of pirates basically ecoterrorists find consumables to help you out like instantrepairs or missilestrikes and scattered through the mission and upon completion gain rare materials these materials cannot be minedproduced by you so you must either do sidequests for them or play in the conflictzones with them you can upgrade your existing factories and add modules to them sim citystyle
the combat missions become dreadfully dull after doing them all on each difficulty especially while not being able to customise your fleet having the militaryaspect banished to its own maps also means that your cities are never in any danger your only enemy here is messing up so bad that you run out of credits and even then you will be given loan after loan

can i recommend 2205
i have bashed many of the new things in anno 2205 this is because personally i didnt want it to change this much i wanted the old formula with a few added twists new factions spiffier gameplay and all that the annoengine is a solid foundation it still looks absolutely gorgeous and simply planning everything out and optimising still had me engaged for a solid 8 hours in the same game
yet to me it feels like 2205 is caught somewhere between its ancestry in the rtseconomysim heaven and its contemporary brethren of the casual citybuilders this indecisiveness is what makes me not recommend the game because it doesnt satisfy either genre it is not complex enough to be a classic annogame yet also doesnt feel like a citybuilder still no round roads no terraforming or landscaping

in the end i must advise caution if you are interested in 2205 have a look at the mechanics and ask yourself if you want an anno which is so very different from the old ones also keep in mind the very steep pricing
at the time of writing this review barring any revolutionary dlc or contentpatches in the near future multiplayer anyone i cannot recommend anno 2205

#####

please dont waste your money on this game i own every anno and was so excited for anno 2205 i preordered the gold with the season pack  i havent been this disappointed since ea ruined command and conquer  

the graphics are beautiful except that the gameplay is very different from 14042070 and grossly overly simplified  the biggest thing that bothers me is that there is no resource management citizens tell you exactly how much of a item they want and you build a building to provide it there is no guessing or balancing once you build the resource building it just happily generates resources for the rest of the game  most buildings just have slots you build them on especially disappointed that the island warehouse and dock area is prebuilt and can only be in the location the force you to put it in  there is no creative expression you can move buildings any time you want for no cost there is no multiplayer no skirimish no scenarios no challenges  just one campaign consisting of nine maps  ive been playing the game on expert and have yet to worry  once about income

the combat is only done on the same few maps on rotation completely seperate from your city  you get one of every ship and you cannot set task groups or use any tactics beyond scorched earth  simply order your ship forward and spam the special ability  the very few side quests are all piled together on the trading posts and are pointlessly stupid go here get this type quests with rewards that have no use  they give you a command ship but there really isnt any point to having a command ship   i cant stand the terrible voice acting constantly repeating the same thing at me    there is no challenge there is no point  this game is like a crappy time management sim that id expect to play on my tablet five minutes at a time

i regret my purchase so much

#####

this is a bwarningb what i am going to describe was true for me but it may or may not be true for you

firstly the game is quite pretty and the gameplay itself is fine if frankly speaking a bit simplistic you will have a fairly relaxed time here you may even have fun i did

until i discovered these facts

1 in the game there are cosmetic and functional aspects which can be unlocked through gaining points for the ubisoft club so no microtransactions malarkey yay right but

2 sometime in 2020 ubisoft moved its drm from uplay to ubisoft connect uc they unlocked all the uplay rewards yay right but

3 because ubisoft done goofed on the move from uplay to uc what is unlocked in uc is not actually unlocked in your game 

this means essentially that parts of your game may remain locked and you literally have no way of unlocking those parts you cannot unlock those parts through gameplay nor can you even microtransaction your way out of it as reprehensible as that is 

so this is a warning you can gamble of yourself being lucky and avoiding this nonsense you can even gamble on ubisoft fixing this problem but i wouldnt play russian roulette if i were you

and frankly this would have been an immediate refund spoiler but i cant because steam is an ass and wont even listen to you if you have more than 2 hours game timespoiler 

this is what ubisoft support said iwe can confirm there is a known issue with legacy rewards offered through ubisoft connect at this time the rest of the game should be working well otherwise however i because yeah sure having some functionality permanently locked means game should be working well otherwise

ubi have been playing for 12 hours in hope of an unlock only to find that i am trapped in a room with no windows no doors and dare i say it no lock dont let this be you bu

#####

i thought all the ubisoft connect review bombs were probably crazy usually people just complain about having to use two platforms and its often just an extra splash screen and a piece of extra software you didnt need

boy was i wrong

ubisoft connect is a broken piece of garbage that doesnt work 95 of the time it requires sometimes 45 exact same prompts to launch the game it is constantly updating almost every day why they arent fixing it it does not matter how many times you say remember me when logging in it will forget your login credentials on at least a weekly basis it fails to sync cloud saves the majority of the time ubisoft connects uplay store is broken in game it says you have everything unlocked in the store in game everything is locked

seriously as a canadian im ashamed this company operates in canada theyre an embarrassment they honestly think running ubisoft connect alongside steam makes them look good no it only highlights how incompetently designed your platform is by showing how it breaks almost every other launch of the game while steam works flawlessly

is the game good sure but ubisoft connect will drive you crazy even if you are otherwise enjoying your time with the game

#####

ubisoft connect tells me i have no internet
ubisoft connect is wrong
ubisoft connect prevents me from playing the game
ubisoft connect has determined that i shall never buy another ubisoft game

#####

h1a bold new direction for the anno series but its going to be a hard pill to swallowh1

were now several patches in ive decided my old review no longer applies because frankly the game thats taking shape from the patches is something new and interesting its still anno to an extent but theres a massive raft of changes so lets deal with the tldr first and foremost

if you want a multiplayer anno experience right now this is not the game for you go back to anno 1404 venice i wouldnt even recommend anno 2070 because in my extensive experience of the anno series 1404 is the stronger entry anno 2070 is too crufty and too overloaded with some really strange ideas that just dont quite work venice is a far more consistent challenging and interesting experience and youll find it a far more fun game to play as a multiplayer game and indeed as a versus ai 1404 wins against 2070 for that purpose

however if you want a singleplayer experience where youre attempting to build the biggest cross map empire where youre indirectly fighting your opponents via economic growth and where youre working against disasters and a very different anno one where the biggest challenge is going to be what difficulty you set for yourself and the challenges you impose upon yourself if your idea of a good anno experience is a sandbox game then this is potentially the anno you want as a sandbox game setup its easily the strongest of the lot with a campaign that works with the sandbox to create comfortably the largest singleplayer empire that youll handle

h1its not going to be everyones cup of tea that much is absolutely clear if youre a fan of anno 1404 think real careful before you push the buy buttonh1

anno 2205 does some much needed ripping away of the bandaids this much is entirely true it gets away from requiring you to math out the building resource chains by providing sector balances that help you understand at a glance whether you have enough of each resource to stay in the positives as youre building the addition of modules despite the fact you have to deal with a fairly substandard combat mini mission to really harvest the stuff is inspired being able to upgrade your production facilities is great anno 2070 had similar to some extent but nothing on the scale of this which is kindof important because with the latest patch using modules is critical to keeping an efficient colony running

the game cleans up the upgrade paths for several of the citizen types however it also oversimplifies them a bit too much theres now only two levels of upgrade for two of the citizen types which is deeply unfortunate a third level for both the arctic and lunar citizens would have gone a long way to making things a lot more interesting overall along with increasing interdependency for various goods you start seeing some of the multistep goodness that was part and parcel of annos late game with investors but tragically theres really not much payoff in exploring it beyond better tax returns

the tundra is also a missed opportunity which is annoying because there was a real chance there to make up for some of the lost complexity but once again it seems that ubi are hell bent on keeping the various citizen types as self contained as is possible and minimising the interdependencies until really late game when it stops mattering quite as much

h1its not all bad news thoughh1

however the veterans update and the stock market update do bring significant improvements to the table the former allows you to ratchet the difficulty up to genuinely tough levels finally presenting a real challenge for those who are comfortable with anno 1404 and the like and the stock market update adds a new layer to the game placing you in indirect competition with your npc opponents who have now been elevated from mere talking heads to potential threats who if youre not careful could buy you out and bring your game to an abrupt end offworld trading company style 

the game explicitly warns you that by activating the stock market this will have irreversible consequences on your company and a backup will be taken theres a good reason for that the ai isnt shy about putting the screws on at the higher difficulties and you can expect auctions to come in at a steady rate if youve not got a good positive credit balance

h1so where are we at now ubis vision for the game is coming togetherh1

orbit the final known piece of content on the roadmap is entering beta now its free to everyone on the season pass theres a hope its better than tundra it needs to be however the free content has been broadly positive and the stock market addition actually creates a situation where if youre playing at high difficulty its eminently possible to lose to the ai through economic manipulations and calamities wrecking your company

in effect this is a sandbox anno with teeth and its a very big very sprawly sandbox with a narrative that sits behind it that guides you through the various stages of the game right up to the point you have a corporate hq and then youre on your own go free little bird and build as much as you like

now thats going to sit well with some people and sit badly with others because its all going to hinge on the idea of if a sandbox anno appeals to you if it does then this is definitely an interesting concept and 2205 executes it with style however as an actual anno game thats a harder question to answer its going to get filed under maybe and whether that becomes a yes or a not really hinges on blue bytes remaining support cycle before they turn their attention to the next in the series

with the latest additions i give it a cautious thumbs up because i do enjoy a good sandbox but i really recommend people do their research on this one its not just another anno game

verdict  bcautious recommendation do your research if youre an anno veteran and want a multiplayer game avoid if you want a sandbox anno upgrade that to recommendedb

bultimate edition reviewb wall of text edition updated as of 852017

in my opinion this game is not recommended at full price compared to what its predecessors have this game is also a tough sell the only version that is recommended is the ultimate edition 

i am starting with combat because in my opinion with the changes it should not be in annos 2205 combat is weaker compared to its past installments since there was a lot of changes made to trade routes what ships you interact with and now its a multisession singeplayer experience with different factions of your corporation on different maps it has defeated why any combat should be in the game in the first place its true the anno franchise focus is not on combat but its past titles had purpose for it being in with the new formula combat is just tack on feature on the bright side you dont have to worry about pirates in the very begining of the game you do have to worry about attacks with the frontier dlc but you dont have defensive structures or cool toys just a navy you have to call in to your sector the game could have benefited if the feature was cut completely and resources  time could have been spent elsewhere also the combat is force upon you for getting special resources 

trade routes are set up in the menu as always with some changes of course you do not need a shipyard to build different ships to haul items for your citizens you also dont need to purchase the ship with currency and resources it just goes onto your money budget expense  also you can only transfer one item per ship per island where in past games you can do multiple items and set it up for multiple islands

the level design decent at best i like the cool sector affects and special missions that get you special bonuses other than that compared to its predecessors the game could use a map editor with community driven content to help the game replay value since they took out random map generation even though it did not make significant variety changes in the maps it was enough to help the replay value of the game 

note cities skylines is a different city game but it offers tons of replay value with community driven content blue bytes should have taken note of this before making it a complete singeplayer experience not having community driven content when cities skylines does makes it hard to compete in the market ubisoft should have at least let them implement steam workshop support 

the npcs interaction is weak sauce compared it predecessors in anno 2205 npc interaction is mostly through quests stock market and trade with certain ones of course very limited where as in past games you compete not just in stock market but resources military power trade and land you also had diplomacy this adds to another reason to remove combat

the orbital building is underwhelming instead of taking advantage that in space you can build in whatever direction you want you are limited to a 2d building plane i had a lot more fun being amazed at building things on the moon building the artic temperate and tundra regions is also a lot of fun this dies out with the limited map variety

the different factions in your corporation require different regions scientists in tundra  artic regions employees in temperate region engineers on the moon all contribute to research on the orbital station you built if you did not get too bored building it  this contributes to a problem the new anno game has compared to past games building variety in your main city past games you had three factions with different looking buildings in your main city this is no longer the case
this brings me to another main problem i have with this game the multisession you must load into every map to make a supply chain to satisfy and advance your faction in another region you did not have this in other games while i like making big cities the tradeoffs they made to make big cities in this game was not worth it my opinion i also notice they recycled assets from anno 2070 while recycled is not unheard of some of the ways they do it looks bad 
overall anno 2205 is not a bad game i like it but it has its faults something i would like to recommend at full price even to help the developers but compared to what you get in past games you get your moneys worth with replay value in past installments this could have been easily countered by mod support since they made this a singleplayer only experience 

funfact for those who do not know who argue negative reviews make huge impacts on sales 
a study was done by the susquehanna financial groups video game journal as well other studies have concluded there is little to no correlation between reviews and the resulting sale preformance aparently to some people this is not case though and think this one review will destory the frachise

this review is overall is a work in progress

#####

pay for a game cant play that game because ubisoft are incapable of having servers that work properly despite their profits this is a singleplayer game and i cant play it because ubisoft doesnt trust its customers fuck this game and fuck ubisoft

#####

great game ubisoft connect sucks im old when i decide to play video games its because i want a break from my life escapism at its finest i think this game is a lot of fun but when literally at least 13 of the time i cant play the game because of ubisoft connect then f it im not pirating games so dont screw me like im some 

update  for those of you who struggle with ubisoft connect i find it works much better if you go to task manager and terminate the program before trying to launch the game instead of screwing up 75 of the time it seems to only prevent the game from loading once in a blue moon

#####

i read through the negative reviews i thought i could stomach the weaknesses of the game compared to the earlier anno games because of the interesting parts anno 2205 had to offer i was wrong

more than anything else i really miss setting up the elaborate transport routes that i used for the previous anno titles now its just a very bland pulling a few sliders and resources are automatically transferred from one zone to another for a small fee not a single ounce of creativity in it your people in one zone demand a good that can only be made in another zone you create a supply of that good in that other zone and then pull the transport slider then youre done

i will say that significant improvements to the naval combat game were made but it plays more like its own distinct minigame rather than as a cohesive piece of the larger game as a whole

the only challenge of an anno game that is really left in here is being able to do the best you can in effectively tiling your islands with various to maximize your space utilization and minimize any wasted space this is a well implemented mechanic and it was done at least as well as it was in the previous anno games

do yourself a favor and pick up anno 2070 instead if youre interested in this

and if you choose to ignore my advice and buy this game anyway hey i did it too i wont judge you should also know that the dlc kinda does help to make anno 2205 a more complete game but it also does inflate the pricetag that much more

#####

while anno 2205 is a step away from the traditional anno formula its not a bad game  the grapics are beautiful and the attention to detail is awesome  zooming in on one of the many industrial buildings and being able to see the function of each is a great addition to any city builder game  the game play is smooth and the addition of new sectors is awesome and adds to the complexity of the game  cons are well the combat missions grinding these so i can build a bridge sucks they are necisary to upgrade your orbital station as well all in all id give anno 2207 an 810 if you enjoy city builders give this a go

#####

you know

negative revies on games like these are the reason we are not getting really new innovative games anymore

i was torn about this for the longest time until i decided to be open minded and just take the game for what it is and not what its predecessors were

yeah sure its not like anno 2070 or 1404 or all the other ones 

 there are no other factions
 its single player only
 the core gameplay revolves around expanding your city bigger and bigger to get more income to be able to financially sustain the expensive buildings in the arctic and on the moon

i was initially really disappointed but i went back to it time and time again loving it more every time 
sure the season pass feels like a fraud and the additional content is rather weak the tundra is really pointless but the space station dlc is okay since it offers something like a research tree 

i really got to love the game when they added the new difficulty level for me the challenge in this game is to manage the finances while still trying to make my own building layouts and still make it look like a beautiful somewhat realistic looking city i hate when people just build after the most efficient layouts for maximum efficiency i did that in previous annos too but here it doesnt cut it for me because then your cities will look like shit and you have kind of enough land with all the different landmasses you can acquire anyway so in my strive for perfection and love for toughest game settings i am actually enjoying this game quite a lot 

the only thing i regret is playing through it initially only on medium difficulty i wish i hadnt spoiled all the lore already playing it through being so easy cause it was medium only if i could unlearn this game again i would recommend to me to start of at the hardest difficulty and really encourage me to healthy mix of aesthetic and layout perfection

if you consider getting this game take it for what it is a rather relaxing beautiful city builder sure its shallow sure the combat sucks but overall i found myself enjoying this game for like 120 hours and i am probably gonna go back to it in the future

i truly believe the game could have been much better and received way more support from the devs if it wasnt for close minded people just voting this down because they wanted something that is exactly like the other anno games instead of just accepting what this game actually is

similar to how people that liked fallout 3 hated on fallout 4 because it was so different if you just let the developers try new things sometimes beautiful things can happen

save your money this one is barely worth 25 its good for one playthrough only and this is not an angry exaggeration you play the tutorial only to find out that the tutorial is the entire game and thats all there is to the game you just play it over and over again but its the same every time the goal is to build a generator on the moon since theres nothing to stop you from doing that and theres no more randomyl generated maps after youve done it once youve experienced everything the game has to offer no more challenges scenarios multiplayer factions trade or real combat its anno with everything that makkes anno sucked out of it 

the game is still ok but 60 is an insane price for what the game is and locking the rest of the game behind an additional pay way is just disgusting 20 is probably the sweet spot but that doesnt actually make the game any better so choose wisely

#####

regardless of the healthy amount of negative reviews i opted to purchase definitely do not regret it

the scale of the game is actually helped by being broken up into sectors it never feels disconnected or like isolated and independent scenarios you regularly find yourself going to back to each sector to changeoptimizeupgrade it

it looks gorgeous

i can understand why people have a problem with it but i found myself enjoying it tremendously

#####

i really like these resource managementbuilding games
anno 2205 was great until it stopped working because the ubisoft service was down with no hope of support  if you build drm in your game at the very least ensure the people who have paid for it can use it

i understand local shops suffering from covid but a large games company that is unable to provide email or chat support is just bad  evil management

in the light of the current situation we are temporarily restricting our support to live chat only
chat is currently unavailable please choose another support method

i was super interested when i first heard they announced a new anno
and even better when they announced the settingtime period it will be in because obviosly i like that futuristic stuff
so i immediately prepurched the gold edition which was a bad decision but i will come back to that point later
well of course i should have cancelled my order when they cancelled the beta which seems to always be a very bad sign but we cant blame them for cancelling it can we seeing how the game is now the release of the beta would have been an extreme knockout for the sales because many players who loved the anno series for its not so mainstream features could have easily returned their copies of the game oh and of course a large part of the community would already have lost interest in the game even before the official release date
so let me list some pros and cons

pros
 my taste i relly like the setting the game is in 
 a large number of buildings are well animated and fun to look at  especially the mines 
 the mountains look really great
 the move tool is useful but even on very hard mode cough it does not cost you anything at all which is a joke
 like the upgrade tool  easily upgrade many housings at once 
  german synchro  cool to have some of the old voice actors 
 i actually like that the buildings arent always rectangular  combines good with the module system
 im not sure yet whether i like or hate the module system seems like a revisit of the old field mechanics
 some hints and easter eggs linked to 2070 and older annos

well and now they come  the glorious cons
 the combat system is not so funny at all as you are doing the very same shit over and over again on 3 different maps but to be honest i only visited the combat missions 4 times as they are so booring imo 
 ok so i had to get the rare materials elsewhere  lets do some jobs for the replaceable npcs wah that is one of the most annoying things i had to face follow that drone get get that drone and let it kill some ship get theres goods 
 i dont know why but the assignments are so much more mentally painful then in the previos anno games  where i sometimes even enjoyed these  
 so you actually need to do booring assignments or booring combat missions to get rare materials which you will need to make your production work efficient  you also will get some for free when your corporation level advances and sometimes also can buy a little amount of them  but thats way not enough 
 i really miss the opportunity to build a fleet by my own and cruise them over the map
 they proudly announced there will be islands with 3 times more building space than in previos anno games  what they didnt yell out was that there are just 3  5 islands per map which also is way much smaller than the largest map size in previos anno games and also  through the indroduction of housing complexes which are basically 4 times larger standart houses the relative island size shrinks a lot  basically you dont have more buildings on the island than in previous anno games  
 they always told you wont be forced to to combat missions so far so bad every 5 minutes or so an annoying npc reminds you with the same text over and over that your help is needed didnt find any button to disable these yet 
 no competition no random events no ai  please dont tell me that that cheap this is you and there are the big 5 screen should be something like competition
 of course this is my personal opinion but there is no ai no multiplayer  i dont expect them to implement it  what is there only building not even a single survival aspect that is defenitely not an anno for me 
 the removal of influence radius of the pulblic buildings is bad for city layout in combination with the not so in line going dimensions of the public buildings its now the best way to put them all clumped together in an ugly supply block
 also the public buildings integrate very bad in the cities when there are many post level 2 buildings around  just looks misplaced imo  was better in prev annos 
 the new way they handle the economy systems is to much simplified for me i really liked that every building produced its own goods in and then had them in their own inventory ready to get hauled by a transport vehicle  i found it good that the production had to spin up to finally run at full capacity in the previous games  it created a good element of minidisaster while already running out of goods
 the soundtrack is weaker than in prev anno games
 the endlesscampaigncombiantion is not really well done i dont even see any campaign in that as the sectorprojects  which i think they are talking of at campaign elements  are again only a series of these already mentioned extremely annoying assignments  get dat boat follow dat drone bla bla bla 
 i dont see much complexity but quantity  thousands of booring fruit farm buildings to support you 100000s of people  
 i see many people writing that the water looks soooooooo good  am i the only one who thinks that it is a step backwards from 1404 and 2070
 the 3th and 4th tier housings in the temperate zone look very low on detail compared to the other tiers
 reminds me of cities skylines in many moments  which is bad imo because i dont want to play cities skylines but an anno 
 someone realised that all islands have cliffs no beach at all hurts the look imo
 i restarted after some hours on medium because it really felt to easy  actually i didnt feel any game changing difference after starting and playing on that hard mode
 oh did i forget to mention that the game is basically dead  booring  after 18hrs  which is a pitty 
 currently i really regret buying this game but theres no possibility to return it right

i was hesitent after seeing so many negative reviews im a big fan of the old anno series and have played nearly every game

that said ive been having a lot of fun with this anno 2205  im not sure why its getting so much flak  the real cons are no multiplayer and no procedurally generated maps which limits replay

however it being my first playthrough and i was always going to play single player first even if there was a multiplayer option ive been having a ton of fun  its taking a lot of the painful and monotonous parts out i dont have to retweak every trade route painstakingly when my supply line changes its much easier and leaves me more time to playing  moving buildings around is awesome as your cities develope and grow 

sure the side missions are repetetive and feel unnecessary after a while but theyre there if you needwant

fun game i highly reccommend

#####

finished game no replay value separating combat to its own separate map is a horrible idea previously the mix of combat and the economy made the maps interesting the lack of custom maps or any real opponents is extremely odd 

i dont quite understand why they just didnt let people turn off combat if they dont like it and disable opponents if they dont like it options are good and this game as very few options and next to no replay value

graphics are good and the rate based system makes things very clear overall though it basically stripped out much of what made anno games fun

#####

anno 2205

after playing countless hours of anno 2070 i was expecting an expanded universe set further into the future set to explain the story of the people that lived on past the troubles of anno 2070 including trading land grabbing and even a whole indepth complicated tech web

however i was sadly mistaken

anno 2205 does include such things to a very very basic degree that dumbs down most of the key ideas in the game and only complicating the idea of constructing what materials you need to keep your citizens satisfied at the same time not over producing so you dont go negative in revenue as you progress through the game it slightly progresses in difficulty with multiple biomes that are needed to send even more goods to your one main big city located in a more green environment 

i found that the heating component in the artic biome finicky and difficult to build up any sizeable towns and the moon is forever unforgiving with how expensive it gets the whole premise is that the more you make money wise in your main city the cost of manufacturing and fabrication of goods in the artic and lunar areas still do not lean you to the negative end of the spectrum this is where difficulty does offer some interesting challenges but it can be easily done with a proper strategy

the story is boring and other wise useless due to the fact that they hardly explain the lead enemy faction nor the other competing corporations story is very linear and provides an end goal which defeats the purpose of an end game at least with anno 2070 when you were done in a world you could pack up upgrades and other materials to be launched on a new map however in anno 2205 once you start a new corporation you are stuck to go through the same old boring speech about being a corporation to build up a huge community spending enormous amounts of money doing so and lucky you if you go bankrupt on most difficulties they just give you more money

there is only one upside to this entire game that i must say ok maybe two
1 the graphics look amazing the massive detail the designers went into is phenominal if you zoom in on even the closest tiny robot it shows super high resolutions with awesome animations that seem flawless
2 call backs to anno 2070 a few side missions will relate to old technology that has been left behind by some of the leading factions in anno 2070 which provides you materials and resources surprisingly they did it for the most part in a very tasteful way however i do not like a lot of the actual side quests most of them being attach this small robot and go find trash or kill stuff or collect stuff across the map

the fun of exploration and city construction have been severely gutted in this recent installment of the anno franchise but probably one of my biggest disappointments yet

pros
1 graphics are the best yet seen in any anno game ive personally played
2 call backs to anno 2070 seem tasteful and provide small background for those who havent previous anno games including anno 2070
3 the tutorials were extremely helpful strangely at times too helpful i had to turn them off at one point to focus

cons
1 dumbed down resource management  resource management is so gutted it seems that it takes away from the games potential
2 the story is boring and outright unnecessary  the story provided a very basic idea of what the goal was to completing the game but dragged it along with a few forgetable characters and annoying supporting characters combat scenes seem tacky and rushed
3 continuous play  end game hardly exists  back in anno 2070 when you got to the end of the game that meant you were currently researching or finish researching everything in this massive tech web that would support upgrades and boosts to material deposits this no longer really exists and the reason to keep going is pointless 
4 a basic economy with basic production buildings with complicated building placements  the overall idea of building structures was fun in anno 2070 and it was essential to progress in anno 2205 they have decided that levels should determine your progress in the game which can keep you high up in ranks against other corporationswhich i still hardly understand the point of having a leaderboard bracket essentially instead of an expanding people across massive lands with different needs the needs for most in the game are nearly the same except at few times which lunar is the most different out of them all 
5 if you suck at the game they just keep giving you money normal mode and below essentially  on a specific difficulty level and below the lead company having interests in your corporation will announce they are worried on your financial situation and fund you a huge load of cash this defeats the purpose of even trying to keep positive in revenue throughout the game because you can just keep rolling in your imaginary cash bundles of ious

verdict
i think anno 2205 is a game that should be at least tried out through a one time only playthrough and then youd grasp the whole concept of the linear games storyline one playthrough roughly 20 hours if slow like i was is all someone would need to realize that this isnt the type of game that deserves 60 maybe 1525 at best

should you play it
yes briefly though

wait for sale or buy right away
wait for sale this game is definitely not worth full price in my honest opinion

review  510

edit

i would also like to mention the fiasco that was called beta you know that thing that i swear was promised and never happened what so ever i know none of us should ever expect something such as that but i think it would be a really wise decision for the to follow up on their word and make possible changes that could affect the overall likeability to the game

annnd i didnt see that anno 2205 will have quite a bit of free dlc which should be nice but not ground breaking probably still not worth it the 60

end of edit

#####

lost hours because the game decides it doesnt want to autosave
theres no manual save either 

whos the genius that thought up this concept


#####

some people bemoan the changes that this anno brings but for my money it is different from its predecessors in some very positive ways  i am not a fan of competitive rts games so i have always treated this game as a realtime economic simulator  my favorite anno mode is continuous mode and i have only play the series multiplayer a handful of times  with that in mind here are some changes that i liked in this iteration of the franchise

in the past the game was needlessly complicated by a lack of communication of the rules  a big part of the game is creating production chains eg 2 of one resource makes 4 of another resource which is used to make 1 of a third resource  in all previous iterations quantities were hidden and had to be either referenced by an outside source such as a wiki or meticulously observed and recorded in your brain  now the values are visible from the ui and the game can be learned and mastered without an outside aide  this is a huge improvement and cannot be understated  the reason for not making the production chains visible was baffling to me as they were obviously hardcoded and learnablethey just served to obfiscate the game and make it harder for new players to enjoy

the main change in this iteration though is the definite shift from economic rts to citybuilder campaign game  no longer do you compete with ai or players over territory and build up your base until you win the map  now there is a single overarching campaign which drives your entire time with the game  instead of starting over from scratch with each new session you instead move to different maps and start a new colony there expanding your current companys foothold and resources there is no longer an ai presence on the map to compete with for resources  now there are invaders and catastrophies but generally speaking the only limit on your expansion is your own efficiency

most of the mechanics of anno remain in the campaign but are refined and expanded to great success  there are quirks of each map that affect your production goods that have to be transferred between civilization types and there are oneoff missions which provide an alternate method of obtaining resources and making progress  this is the first game where i felt like missions were woven into the fabric of the game well  in previous iterations i often just ignored the missions that were given and even if i tried to do them i often found them to be obtuse  now i feel the missions are both important and engaging and i do them all the time

i also feel like the season pass really adds a lot of intrigue to the game  between the stock market space colonies and the new sectors the game has hundreds of hours of gameplay  unlike most games where dlc doesnt interest me im glad to have purchased this season pass

i have loved every version of anno since the first one i played 1701  each time they improve the mechanics and the presentation and this version is no different

#####

i read through the negative reviews i thought i could stomach the weaknesses of the game compared to the earlier anno games because of the interesting parts anno 2205 had to offer i was wrong

more than anything else i really miss setting up the elaborate transport routes that i used for the previous anno titles now its just a very bland pulling a few sliders and resources are automatically transferred from one zone to another for a small fee not a single ounce of creativity in it your people in one zone demand a good that can only be made in another zone you create a supply of that good in that other zone and then pull the transport slider then youre done

i will say that significant improvements to the naval combat game were made but it plays more like its own distinct minigame rather than as a cohesive piece of the larger game as a whole

the only challenge of an anno game that is really left in here is being able to do the best you can in effectively tiling your islands with various to maximize your space utilization and minimize any wasted space this is a well implemented mechanic and it was done at least as well as it was in the previous anno games

do yourself a favor and pick up anno 2070 instead if youre interested in this

and if you choose to ignore my advice and buy this game anyway hey i did it too i wont judge you should also know that the dlc kinda does help to make anno 2205 a more complete game but it also does inflate the pricetag that much more

#####

the game is pretty good and the graphics are awesome
but i lost many hours of progress because often the autosave wont work

theres no manual save or quicksave you have to rely on an unreliable autosave sy
stem

#####

terrible company if you change your email address it cant verify the ownership of the game and you lose it and can never play it again dont support ubisoft

#####

uplay gives problems everytime when i try to open after taking breaks
uplay needs to be more flexible and reachable i bought the game for 40 and now i cant play it because you are having trouble autheticating ridiculous

#####

anno 2205 is a confused game with a confused premise in the prior game earth had been flooded and three factions unified it under peace commerce and science since then this quest for resources has tired the planet out and put us in a power shortage the lunar licensing program is some sort of government project for allowing you to set up a base on the moon in order to create infinite energy with fusion reactors 

the main mechanics are building and logistical flow as you build you use up more of x which means you need to build y in order to have more of z all wit hthe purpose of population requirement whackamole as in all anno games lower class people exist in a few thousand while the upper class make up the majority of your population and work force this is because workers are merely tier one investors are top tier i dont get the logic here nor did i ever get this class system logic in anno games

this game was probably intended or atleast shaped by shoddy mobile city builders you have special resources you get through special missions that you use to upgrade your special buildings each zone has a progress reliant special event on it and you are constantly harassed by mission givers with pitiful rewards this all reeks of the intent to take up as much of your time as posible thankfully any of the online features were scrapped and the arbitrary level up mechanic just serves to pad your income with injections to ensure you never stop building or playing for too long 

if you buy this make sure you get all the dlc in a deal the game was clearly designed to require this dlc as its all extra features that make the game far easier to progress in sadly this may of been the final nail in the coffin of the 2000 series of anno which enjoyed meager cult classic status

anno 2205 however is a soulless grind filled with nonsensical busywork the game relies far too much on the anno formula and it does not translate well to the casual clicker style the game portrays it in the depth of 2070 is gone building naval ships is gone actual competitors in the game world are gone the economy is oversimplified to build moar things

and to cap it off there actually is a vague mmo villain in this game the orbital watch they serve as objects for your ships to shoot in missions have garish evil red paintjobs and otherwise peacefully patrol the water in the area they inhabit they dont have any permenant way to hurt you they just exist the story is part of the previous wave of lunar settlers rebelled for some reason and think they own the moon you never actually get to see them on the moon in fact their entire presence on earth is in the form of a navy and extensive network of naval bases i point this out because their claim is youre invading them when they spend the entire game invading you with you only defending earth 

tldr its a casual city builder borrowing a license name buy 2070 instead

#####

tldr dont buy this now wait for sales  additional expansions to play this game theres no mp so you wont lose any fun

the game looks gorgeous but compared to previous installation anno 2070 theres so many elements that have been cut down from this game such as

 skirmish multiplayer mode you can only play campaign
 massive command ark that you can personalize  store items
 events
 army theres no army production or military buildings that you can build battle has been seperated into its own mission away from the base building and you can only use ships not even submarines and you are stuck with 3 types of ship that you can upgrade stats only no visual difference
 ai opponent in any map youre playing by yourself theres no opponent ai only some static trader ai 
 random map you will be playing on the same map on all playthroughs 3 different map for each region type temperate arctic lunar
 progression youll only unlock some achievement and some minor cosmetics for your command ship  corporate logo thats all unlike anno 2070 where you can customize your ark get some rare components for stats upgrade in an island etc you will have nothing to do once you can build company hq except for onetime achievements in anno 2070 you can continue playing to get some rare components
 manual resource management all items produced in a regions is calculated into a total automatically unlike in anno 2070 where you have to carefully adjust your trade routes and amounts
 no component research you cant make some upgrade to boost your production  reduce maintenance of buildings in an island like anno 2070


then theres some part that annoys me

 the company hq doesnt provide any benefits at all but will need an insanely high maintenance credit power worker
 building location for docks are fixed as well as locations for mountain  coastal buildings
 building modules for your buildings require special resource that can only be earned from missions  special map project really problematic in early game but not at late game and different for temperate arctic and lunar regions
 resources are shown in net rate not amount i can have surplus of 1 of android lategame resource and 400 of it in storage but i can only sell  transfer it in rate not amount
 amount of credit that you can hold is limited based on your company level
 you will jump a lot between maps to adjust your production rate its very repititive and brainless boring
 sector projects are almost only for getting achievement once youre in late game their bonuses are small compared to what you can make by yourself oh and the ornamental projects are purely for some ornaments not even a steady income
 every new game will be the same same story same maps etc it will only differ by the game settings that you picked
 there are some rival companies but only for preventing you from buying additional regions once your level is above them you can buy the regions they hold only that no economy sabotage or any of the activitied that the ai used to do back in anno 2070


but there are some parts that i like

 resource are counted in rate so its much easier to control resource production especially one requiring many other resources and it makes transfer to multiple regions much easier
 all special buildings for increasing population level as well as warehouses doesnt have radius but instead provide a constant amount this adds flexibility to building placement as well as some realism where i have to build multiple of them in a small dense population area
 uniqueness of each region type in arctic you can only build resident places near factories and in lunar you need shield around everything


summary

clearly ubi wants much larger player base  moar money and thus this game is streamlined as  to almost pure pile of  theres no depth at all no sense of progression almost no online features no opponents to challenge my company trading with ai is almost useless no military buildings bland army and some units are clearly reskin of unit models of anno 2070

perhaps ubi is cutting down all those elements so they can charge them for additional  as dlcs or expansions ubi  ea name dlc as expansion as the term dlc has such a bad rep because of them

for me this game is a 2030 game that has really polished looks and animation this game doesnt worth your money and the saddest thing is that i preordered the gold edition and cant refund because i spent hours trying to find additional depths to the game that i couldnt find fml

#####

ubisoft connect is horrible it often makes launching the game impossible

#####

a very dissapointing game all in all 

the streamlining does make the game initially feel simply to engage with but i found that i stopped caring about the layout of my colonies to maximize efficient chains like we used to do in the old anno games the end result of that was that i barely remembered where i put that generic production building that i want to upgrade now but cant recall where it was or what it looked like

it is a very pretty game quite something to look at and thus far i have not encountered any bugs which for an ubi game is rather surprising i got a good few hours out of it before it just felt like a chore to keep jumping between the different maps to boost production of x would then needed to boost production of y to support the increased population and then needed to go to another mapo to boost the supply of p to send to that colony in some ways we did the same in previous annos but there was something delightful in setting up your trade routes efficiently and everything was on the same map and it all felt more immersive jumping out of the map to go to another map breaks that sense of interconnectedness that i didnt even realise was so important from prior games

there is no long term playability to be gained here just a hand holding campaign that might as well be on rails for how simple it is i will try out on the highest difficulty and see if maybe some challenge can be gleaned from this game not that challenge is the most important thing but when it feels like all you are doing is balancing numbers to maximise other numbers that then need to be balancedthe game becomes pointless

i am very dissapointed that i caved and bought this game especially at full price the game is functional and certainly isnt a bad game i feel that it suffers from that curse of it falling short of being good and even having potential to be great i would love to see some free dlc that expands the gameplay and gives us more replayability and randomness to the game 

final verdict
if you enjoyed anno 2070 you might enjoy this i personally was dissapointed with anno 2070 but still enjoyed it but this has moved further away from the winning formula and falls flat with repetative mindlessness no challenge no surprises too much constant drivvle being spouted at you by npcs reminding you about the next mission that is pretty much the same as the last

if you have anything else to play at the moment then dont buy this game i would say that it is currently would 20 at most anything more than that and you are not getting enough bang for your buck which is a pity because the game has been polished well and has a lot of good production values that should warrant more money to be spent but the gameplay falls down too much for me to suggest purchasing it in good conscience

#####

this game is so disappointing 

im not a long time player of the anno series i came in at anno 2070 dont get me wrong most of the changes they made to this game from 2070 i actually like

h1economy systemh1

they simplified this a lot each building tells you exactly how much you produce and exactly how much of which resources it needs most people complain about this feature because they liked having to fiddle with the inputs and outputs of other factories to make the production balanced i didnt like having to fiddle with them i like being told how much i need to produce outright not guessing how much i need to make

h1modulesh1

modules are probably the best addition to this game every factory can be upgraded with different modules that do a variety of things decrease credit upkeep decrease energy use decrease worker use decrease logistics use ill get to this later but every factory has the option of upgrading its production at the cost of needing more energy credits workers etc its always more effecient to slap on a production module than to make another factory but more expensive

h1logisticsh1

much like the economy system they simplified this a lot as well they tell you exactly how much logisitcs a factory needs when its put down this depends solely on how far away it is from the main harbor or one of your depots again most people complain about this simplification i do not in the previous game this variable still exsisted it was just hidden from the player and took a massive amount of waiting around and monitering your factories to make sure each had enough

h1communitiesh1

managing your population once again has been simplified a bit and made more realistic in my mind instead of each building needed by each teir of population having a radius and you have to compact your population buildings into those small pockets its more akin to the logistics system each housing requires a certain amount of information or whatever from different buildings the buildings that produce this information or whatever produces a certain amount each housing costs a different amount of this resource depending on how far away it is from the nearest building that produces it pathing along the roads not as the crow flies this is another change that i like

h1the rest of the good stuffh1

i lump this stuff in here with no description because i want to leave enough room for what i really want to talk about in this game

continents contain different types of workers previously called corporations eco tycoon scientists
trading routes between islands on the same continent are no longer needed trading routes happen between continents themselves

h1combath1

and now we get to the real problem of this game the combat system heres what i imagined went on at hq when they were making this game

they went through all of alpha and half of beta production stages thinking naaaah we dont need combat but when they finally allowed playtesters to play it they hated it and wanted the combat back in so all of a sudden they decided well shit i guess we do need combat back in there so they created some horrible mismatched abomination of a combat system and shoved it down the games throat hoping it wouldnt throw up

they messed up just about every facet of combat that i can think of to start off with it was iextremelyi confusing to me at first i spent at least ten minutes searching through all my factories all my buildings both already made and those i can produce looking for the shipyard or ability to create ships somewhere there is none none zip zilch nada uhhhh wha instead of making your own ships youre given a premade set of ships theres no customization whatsoever the only thing you can do to change it is level them up once they attain a certain amount of combat experience thats it so youre stuck with what they give you dont get me wrong its not a terrible setup and its a pretty well balanced set of ships a couple of tanks an aoe burster a long ranged mortar and one massive ship but sometimes i dont want a well balanced group sometimes i want to run in there with one tank and the rest mortars or all burst damage or all tanks and one healer btw the first mission has an allied cpu healer ship but you never get one

okay so they messed that up but what about where you fight when i was looking for my shipyards i was also looking for defensive capabilities to protect my cities turrets sheilds walls etc there is none none zip zilch nada uhhhh wha once again this confused me until i found out that combat never happens anywhere near your cities it happens a couple of continents over when you go to the overmap to view your different continents you can see combat missions popping up there you click on it and it unloads your other continents and loads that mission map each mission is a map in and of it self if you lose the mission just do it again theres no consequence to you or your city theres 0 fear of failure they couldve made a mobile game with the combat system and it probably wouldve been better than the one they actually made

okay so they messed that up but what about the gui for the fights most of the things ive come to know and love about rts guis and have been a staple of them since the very beginning have been thrown out the window

okay so they messed that up but what about the fights themselves well the first misison is pathetically easy this i wasnt surprised by its the first mission and youre figuring out the combat system come to find out the real reason its so easy is because of the difficulty setting the only one unlocked for the first mission is standard aka easy that mode is way too freaking easy and gives proportionally less of a reward sure thats fine dont have a problem with that the next level advanced is much harder and requires some tactics employed its actually not bad the first time you play it anyway every single mission is exactly the same groups of ships path blindly and stupidly through lines of mines that you can easily sneak in there and blow them up with or you can kite them through the mines saving your combat resources

your combat resources include two types of objects fuel and singleuse items there are three uses for fuel shield repair and mines that dont do much damage but push enemies away quite a distance there are three singleuse items missiles summon submarine allies and emp the combat system is pretty well balanced in my opinion just not very extensive once youve played through two or three missions youve plumed every strategy you can trying but failing to make each one different so it just becomes a grind to do the missions in the end because its the only way you can get a reasonable amount of rare elements you need those materials to create the modules for factories

h1campaignh1

this is the biggest problem i have with this game and pisses me off the most the campaign is fun well balanced and well paced but thats it thats the entire game just the campaign theres 0 replayability and even that you finish in 1520 hours theres no skirmishes theres no secondary campaign theres nothing the only way i can see them adding any more content to this game is by introducing dlc for it so once afuckinggain theyre squeezing their players for all the money theyre worth

h1ratingh1

they made a lot of things easier to comprehend and balance out which i personally like but they simplified the combat system too much the game is fun and its worth 20 not 60 i wouldve been happy paying 20 bucks for a 20 hour campaign not 60 with promised dlc to pay more for

#####

if it aint broken dont fix it one has to wonder what goes through devs minds these days when they decide to make major changes to an already successful franchise if it required major changes it wouldnt be successful in the first place would it

that being said anyone who has been a fan of the previous anno franchises do not buy you are in for a big disappointment replay value is nothing compared to the previous series which i have clocked over 100s of hours on i refused to believe the initial negative reviews on this game because of how much i love the series and i paid the price for that big time by spending over 50 for a game that i barely played

yes the graphics are nice they have tried to make everything simpler from building to simulating the economy as if they want children to play anno too so yeah any kids out there this is for you you would love it

you wont get any of the stuff that you used to love like creating random maps settling on random islands have the relationship of ai players to manage and compete with where you could declare war on them or they could declare war on you or trade with them or become allies etc in fact they almost dont exist not like the previous annos where they physically existed on several islands and you could attack them or they attack you or trade with each other you no longer have the freedom to wage battles anywhere or have your city or the aiis city attacked battles are strictly fought in the middle of nowhere with a silly objective skirmish or sandbox modes do not exist

the only plus to this game is the creativity of the buildings themselves and the graphics and effects other than that it is a complete and utter failure

bithis is a review of the ultimate edition including all dlcsib

for years now the anno games have been the goto series for building your own merchant empire theyre a unique mix of citybuilding and production management that elevate both through careful balance and a glorious layer of polish the series was mainly anchored in the preindustrial era where workshops and tall ships best suited the style of gameplay but anno 2070 took it into the future with hightech manufacturing and ecological concerns now we have anno 2205 an entry with unparalleled scope for the series but one that feels the most out of place with its heritage

mankind was brought to the brink in anno 2070 but ecological catastrophe has given way to an era of corporate stewardship global corporations manage the resources and populations of earth and began to reach out to the moon and stars when a new catastrophe struck massive economic collapse left the lunar colonies abandoned but now the world is ready to return and you are put in charge of an upandcoming megacorp with eyes on the moon by building a solid economic base across the regions of earth and preparing the right resources you can foster new lunar colonies to bring wealth and prosperity to all of humanity

at least thats the pitch the first thing thats going to stick out about anno 2205 is how unrelentingly well corporate it all is the tutorial walks you through the steps of the lunar licensing program the process by which companies can gain access to the moon and begin harvesting its resources youll need to set up company cities and industries in both the temperate and arctic regions of earth produce key goods to construct and upgrade your space elevator and provide for your employees to gain access to more specialized labor all of this is handled stepbystep by your licensing agent who tells you in no uncertain terms what to build and when to build it at every juncture

previous anno titles had plenty of character in both the people you met and the cities you built anno 2205 despite being the bestlooking and most detailed anno yet feels far more sterile and managed than those you can zoom out from your soaring birdeye view all the way down to individual sea lions on the ice pack or crates on the docks but its all extremely cleancut modern and glossy a big part of this might be that theres essentially no story outside of the lunar licensing program which is weird because theres a lot going on in the background thats kind of ignored in favor of your space checklist the orbital watch is a group of lunar separatists who have a shocking amount of military hardware on earth to harass you but they just show up once in awhile in remote conflict zones or to blockade one of your ports the other characters you meet are 100 business concerned only with making deals and trading goods

it may be a dry experience because of the corporate angle but the global scope of the game gives you far more to do than the previous games ever did instead of scenarios anno 2205 plays out over the entire globe at once there are more than a dozen maps to manage at once each with its own islands resources and industries to steward in previous annos you had to manage shipping routes between islands on each map but here youll need to set up transfer routes between different sectors entirely some resources are unique to the polar or lunar regions so once you develop a new resource youll need to figure out where it needs to go too balancing resources is easier this time as the discreet resource counts have been abstracted into positive and negative sector balances to manage

in the end a lot of what folks are used to seeing in an anno game has been abstracted or expanded away in favor of a massive allinclusive resource network and it works in that theres a definite challenge to planning and arranging your industries to grow your company across the world but it might not be what longtime fans are looking for and it might be a bit jarring for newcomers as well some aspects of the game are poorly explained like the importance of modules instead of building new farms or factories every time you need more of a resource you add on to existing buildings with modules the tutorial glosses over this in a single hey maybe try modules popup but they are absolutely essential to keeping your credit and power balances in check moving from the temperate to the arctic regions is also tough due to cost increases and different construction strategies and the jump to the moon is even rougher you likely wont get to do much of anything on the moon when you first unlock it instead needing to go back and massively expand your current holdings until you can afford the absurdly expensive moon stuff

on the bright side there are a ton of systems to explore that can help you reach these goals every sector has a project to complete that provides huge bonuses there or in the case of the dlc tundra sector bonuses to your entire corporation the orbit dlc grants you a powerful space station and associated tech tree that can have a massive impact on your production across the board then theres the global market the stock market the conflict zones the sector merchants and side missions which all provide additional resources and gameplay if you get into the groove of growing your company youll never be bored here as there will always be more goals and more opportunities to look for so many in fact that you might get a little lost trying to overcome some of the roadblocks that arise from the openended design

i can say with certainty that anno 2205 isnt as good of an anno game as its predecessors at least not as good as 1404 or 2070 for sure the global corporation angle isnt a bad idea but it leads to a very sterilefeeling game and ends up being both oversimplified and broad enough to get lost in the appeal here is a specific one the appeal of growing a company into a globespanning powerhouse over a long period of time and i do mean long ive been playing for 18 hours and still havent finished the lunar licensing program i find it very engrossing and relaxing laying out city expansions designing my space station blowing up lunar terrorists and watching all the numbers fluctuate its not the best citybuilder or the best management game but its another unique mix of the two thats worth a try if you like the concept

the game is fun but i keep getting an ownership authentication error tried ubisoft customer service multiple times gave them the information requested multiple times but i never got any resolution i wont purchase any ubisoft games in the future very disappointing

#####

this game has rightfully received a lot of negativity ubi took a lot of what made anno 2070 so damn good and removed it all from this version my main critique of this title is there is no multiplayer i had spent 100s of hours in 2070 in multiplayer with my friends and thats sorely missing from this game 

however as a single player campaign this game has a lot going for it all the different regions in the world map you are able to buy and control all the different challenges of setting up habitation in different zones the story line as you progress is ok the graphics are sweet like the game is sooo beautiful its really breathtaking if you are an anno series fan then for sure you will still love this game but if you hoped for more of anno 2070 then youre going to be slightly disappointed 

if i had any say on this game i would have said 1 add a multiplayer and 2 add a toggle to the speed control because holding the button down for the whole time i play is a major pain

#####

if you have come here rabid and fresh from anno 2070 i would have to say turn away now 

for most previous fans this release has been broken dreams and dissapointment while the core supply chain gameplay is still present it has been altered so heavily that it is hard to consider it to be a game in the same series yes you still build cities and look over your populations ever growing needs but its all handed to you you do not explore islands in search of the resources you need competing with those around you for the precious space no in 2205 you are simply given your islands as token progression milestones and even then these islands are in seperate game states from eachother so you must constantly switch between them as you progress while each island has its own supply chains to look after it feels more like a distraction than expansion all the progress you have made on your first island is put on halt as you now need a 2nd tier resource from your new island that requires plentiful supplies from your first to get your second up and running active combat has also been moved to its own seperate gamespace as well with no unit production and on a much smaller scale you now have a small fleet of pre determined waships that gain experience as they fight in a similar way to command and conquer but much slower  even so combat ranges from tedious and nearly mindless to quite hard dependant on the difficulty you choose however it becomes a game not so much of strategy as it is managing your limited 3 abilities if you have taken the time to read thusfar thankyou and i assume you are likely on the fence about this game as a whole and while i personaly would not pay for this game and if given the chance to refund it i would have but i will leave you with two more likely deal breakers  1 there is no multiplayer whatsoever as a result of the games islands being in seperate instances it was decided this would make multiplayer to complex and it was never implemented and has no plans to be at any point 2 i was able to finish the main content in the game that is to say the main story in under 10 hours and this is without some sort of guide or me even being very good at the game it is just uncharectaristily short of the genre

thankyou again for reading and personaly if you are craving more anno after 2070 has become stale i would say just try to grab a few friends and go back to playing that before you pick up this one

#####

the anno series of realtime strategy games is popular in germany although it suffered with the last two incarnations anno 2070 and anno 2205 many fans of the anno series call this a dumbed down failure i never really played any of the previous anno games i quit anno 1503 after one or two hours building up predefined production chains efficiently under time pressure isnt something im looking for in games too close to work

luckily i enjoyed anno 2205 i must be part of the dumbed down target group building up cities casually reaching new territories launching your own spaceship to the moon all this is pleasant achievement hunting the battles are removed into separate game areas that dont infringe your cities the stock market and frontier dlc added some confrontation which can easily be planned for

after 25 hours i completed the main campaign of getting the moon certification the endless game is seamlessly integrated with the campaign and i continued playing for a few more achievements i completed three more sector challenges i also took over all competitor shares on the stock market and unlocked all space station components

the campaign was really good i also enjoyed the endless game for some time but it gets samey after a while an 810 for the campaign sinks to a 610 well within the endless game

#####

where to even start 

its pretty ill give it that but thats about it this game is riddled with awful decisions and missed opportunities for example a spacebased militant group that uses boats yes like the kind that go on water you get them too and you get to run them around the same 4 or 5 maps every time you need to kill an hour and no i dont know why a spacethemed game is so bent on naval warfare 

then theres the side missions designed to help you pass the time as you wait to get enough resources to do your next major piece of development i hope you enjoy ispy and waiting for your command ship to get across the map

the space station was a great idea lets just build it in 2d with a 3d background and make managing it as needlessly diffficult and pointless as possible 

just to spice it up they throw random events at you every so often nothing like having your biggest source of revenue shut off for 20 minutes because you have a pollution problem only you already have twice the necessary greenery to counteract it so the game just shuts you down for kicks and giggles

from the city layout and building perspective it isnt terrible the resources though are a little insane i recognize that in a polar region fish would be an important source of food but if we already have a heat mechanic built in why cant we have hydroponics too and free up some of those incredibly limited coastal regions you get them in space and why does the tundra need fish too if you have to import food anyway why cant you import from your highproducing temperate zones talk about builtin bottlenecks that make no sense

give this one a pass unless you really want to waste as much time as i did trying to make it more interesting than it is

#####

its a very beautiful and relaxing game 
perfect for someone who just wants to build up an empire in relaxed way without constant threats and punishing difficulty

video review

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrfzurvtyui4

summary 

as someone with close to a 100 hours in anno 2070 i was disappointed with the new direction the developers have taken with anno 2205 many of the modes and features from the previous game have been removed along with multiplayer which was excellent however that doesnt mean that anno 2205 is a terrible game and in isolation i may even have recommended it the tipping point for me is the price its simply too high and there are several other options on the market that offer a similar experience at a lower price including the previous game anno 2070 if you do choose to pick this game up i would strongly suggest you wait for a sale

please watch the review for a more detailed look at the game

#####

bought in sales 60 off quite a good deal

i have played anno 1440 and have read a lot of the not recommended reviews about anno 2205

i agree that they are two games 2205 advanced in some aspects but lacks in some other provided by 1440

first off there is multiplayer in 1440 i dont see that can be implemented in 2205 the reason is that 1440 is more of an rts 2205 has shifted quite heavily towards a city builder  management game

2205 does try to bring back some elements of it by having invasion into your territories disrupting your production and trade and sort of economically force you to go to a war but of course combat is quite a joke compared to 1440 but i would also say the same thing comparing anno to actual rts

on the management side the economic tree was quite deeply developed compared to 1440 20 hours into the game i have yet to fully develope the entire tree the supply and demands of goods from different regions are so intricately linked that it is not a simply plop down several buildings and your are good to go to combat 1440 mode going back and forth and back and forth between regions and trade routes it actually get you to start thinking

and speaking of going back and forth between screens windows 7 does have memory leakage problem with it but my 16gb rig survived 6 hours of gameplay ram only built up to 8gb

some may complain that 2205 involves so much waiting for credits i will say the same thing for 1440 waiting for siege

some complains about how easy the game is because when you go broke game just gives you more money just turn on the difficulty settings you can easily get ass beaten and same as other anno you can turn aspects of game you like or dislike on or off

all in all 2205 is not 1440 they are different 2205 is more of a management game i like to look at it that way and enjoy it that way the dlc does add even more to it dont let the previous installment of anno elude you or if you are die hard fans of previous anno and only enjoy their style you might really want to just skip this title

#####

i watched i waited i kept an open mind filtering out the reviews which were only complaining about ubisofts policies as opposed to the game itself 

i fell in love with an entirely different city builder tropico 6 spent dozens of hours on it and realized id quickly need something similar to pick up the slack once i got bored with it

i bought the game 

i booted it up  or tried to ubisofts launcher really is precisely that bad dont ignore all the complaints  you will have to fight to get this bs running 

but eventually i achieved success the game was running i was building the tutorial was clear if a little on the dry side after tropico 6 the graphics were pretty the music was good the ui was intuitive enough however all that fighting with ubisoft meant that i only had an hour to play before i needed to crash 

fine tomorrows another day i thought to myself ill just save and head to bed 

ill just save 

ill just saaave

except of course that i would do nothing of the sort because this game does not allow manual saves of any kind at all the player gets one  count it  one save file to work with to which the game autosaves their progress 

maybe 

if the process works today 

guess how often it fails gestures grandly to the discussion threads about this very thing which i wish id read before spending my time and money on this bs

so no you cant have multiple games at once  not even 2 or 3 

no you cant save when youd like to  not unless you also want to quit 

so this is me thanking ubisoft for having such a  launcher why because if it hadnt taken so long to boot up this game i might have played too long to get a refund

#####

anno 2205 is one of the worst examples in recent years of the decline of the video games industry once a vibrant and well enjoyed series anno has hit its lowest point with 2205
dumbed down gameplay microtransactions for resources a bejewledesque partner app and a season pass advertising specific dlc only weeks after release makes this latest anno game a complete letdown
the most drastic changes that seasoned anno fans will notice are
 removal of interfaction combat limiting combat to small prebuild npc only quest maps
 dumbing down gameplay mechanics and limiting player control over urban development
 the addtion of special resources to spur development only obtainable through ubisoft club interactions a partner app game modeled after bejewled which will make any anno player feel like a 12 year old or through direct purchase
 removal of the use of navies and boats as they no longer serve a purpose
 removal of trade routes transfer routes are now only used to transfer resources between owned maps
 removal of diplomacy options having replaced diplomacy with a simple buy island button
 removal of environmental effects which provided a challenging and interesting mechanic in anno 2070
 and many other features
all of these reasons contribute to an overall extremely unsatisfactory experience and i cannot in good conscious recommend this game to anyone


#####

keep coming back to this one  its worth tracking down the big update mod for it   google 
anno2205revolutionsmodenglish if you want to give this another shot

#####

i actually like this game and i dont regret my purchase a bit but it has an enormous flaw  an unpatched memory leak that grinds the game to a crawl after an hour or so or even less the more population you have the faster it occurs by the way now most people and most reviews dont like the seriously relaxed difficulty but that doesnt concerns me because the game scratches my particular itch  a game where i can build pretty looking cities without worrying about tactics too much and then gawk at them from every angle and here the game doesnt disappoint  it is very pretty and its design style is nothing but eye candy for me

for that i can forgive things like memory leaks denuvo that piece of garbage uplay i can deal with that but im an exceptional individual probably you wont have the same kind of patience as i do so you would probably dislike this game maybe you should play anno 1404 instead or maybe 1800 if it wasnt a bloody egs exclusive

ps anno 2205 certainly runs better than anno 2070 which doesnt launch at all ffs

#####

pros
 addition of workforce
 hard catchment area of production and service buildings replaced by distancebyroad system
 continuous campaign mode is better than a series of missions
 adam delivers cheeky banter whereas eve was rather creepy

cons
 military feels really simplified  you cant even build ships and the missions become an annoyance after the first few times
 i think they tried to make the trading system more convenient but they ended up making it too simple
 campaign doesnt feel finished  

verdict
they added some good new things but they made the overall game too simple in the process  if you want a futuristic anno play anno 2070 contrary to recent reviews it is playable if you follow the steps to apply the simple patch  otherwise play anno 1800  anno 2205 is the worst of both worlds

#####

another case where you would wish for a neutral option its not a bad game and it does add quite a few very intresting aspects to the gameplay the fact that youre no longer limited to one area and instead control a global enterprise is definetly a great addition you simultanously build up cities on different maps and trade between them however there are no opponents and no multiplayer youre the only one building up stuff theres a bit of shallow military gameplay but exclusively limited to mostly optional and rather boring naval battles with little depth replay value
overall the game has very little replay value as it has no random content and is hence very limited once you settled all maps youre pretty much done with this game it does keep you entertained for those 2025 hours due to the limited content theres however little to none replay value
i think the additions wouldve given room for a lot of in depth gameplay but i consider it to be wasted in this game overall i cannot recommend it while its certianly still worth when on sale

#####

h1solid building gameh1
b anno 2205 b is one of the weakest parts of the series i dont think it can compete with the others the principle of anno is very simplified here there are many features in this game but after 10 hours you have seen and played through all of them it doesnt have the potential of a 100 hour endless game nevertheless i would recommend this game but only in sale

i would like to add that ubisoft connect is the shabbiest launcher in the world ubisoft if youre not even willing to update and improve this launcher then get rid of this junk i honestly have to confirm 6 times before opening the launcher that it opens then i have to log in every time it cant remember my data i must have the launcher opened at all times so that my rewards are available ingame there hasnt been any progress for years

#####

bis this a bad gameb not really

bis this a true anno gameb not really

i absolutely loved anno 14042070 both fantastic games the new anno 2205 has nothing the old ones had and basically feels as though everything has been stripped away from the game and dumbed down like other people have said it literally feels like you are playing an app on a tablet

for me personallythe biggest thing about playing an anno game is the transport of goods setting up efficient trade routes between islands protecting your ships against any potential threatsattacks and managing your vast and complex settlementsislands

anno 2205 has very simplified trade routes goods are transported from one location to another instantly via the ingame ui no trading between islands using your boatsships and no battle ships battle ships are in seperate instanced areas where you have to attack enemies and buildings which in my opinion is rubbish it just feels like they have done a total uturn from what an anno game should be and has always been

bif you are looking for a very casual atmospheric and graphically impressive city building game and you are not bothered if its like the old annos or not you may very well get a lot of enjoyment out of this gameb

bif you want an up to date modern version that has the same play style as anno 14042070 then this game is not for youb

isince playing anno 2205 for a little bit i deleted it and reverted back to playing anno 2070i

#####

the core logistics management gameplay loop is recognizably anno but otherwise 2205 is a completely experimental departure from every previous game in the series ive played

good on you blue byte its dozens of times more playable than any of them  

anno 2205 has its warts but overall it is a much more consistent and enjoyable experience  i understand the complaints that it is too abstracted but its a genre that could do with a healthy dose of abstraction  gone is any attempt to kludge in janky rts combat thank goodness the combat is still there on an optin basis but is severed from the main game regardless  im particularly glad they made participation in the stock market optional  once you opt in it is a constant distraction that overtakes the entire game  nice of blue byte to backup your save at that point

its a thoughtful entertaining game far more approachable than its predecessors  and after blue bytes successful efforts to rescue anno 2070 from ubisoftenforced oblivion this year im really happy to support the studio even if it means doing it through ubisoft

two thumbs up

#####

 ubisoft you really want to bug me for a review when your ubisoft connect wont let me play a game i paid for really so no i would not recommend this game to anyone for any reason due to the faulty ubisoft connect because basically you pay for a game you can not play

#####

cons having been on the brink of being a tolerable game this most recent update just killed the remaining faith i had left in the anno franchise and ubisoft it really breaks my heart because i have put in hundreds if not thousands of hours total into anno games ever since anno 1503 

the first true signs of trouble were when they moved to annoonline a freemium game that became just a complete grind a huge waste of time to build even a modest city nevertheless i had extremely high hopes for anno 2205 the trailer and gameplay footage had me absolutely stoked and brought back the little kid in me i had hoped that ubisoft had seen the errors of their ways of course they havent since addictive freemium games are a trashy yet extremely profitable business model however any hope was dashed when it became apparent 10 hours into anno 2205 that they are still trying to expand their customer base to the ultracasual crowd and find creative ways to keep players away from actual citybuilding

i tolerated the stupid side quests where you go look around the map for containers or send out your command ship to pick up some idiot fisherman that got stranded 20 feet away from a bustling spaceport because they were completely optional and was a good way to pass the time and wait for resources to collect up during early stages of the game however with the most recent update i find myself doing less city building and more timewasting those optional side quests became jaw droppingly stupid in the form of calamities that will absolutely wreck your delicate cislunar economy unless you spend 10 minutes scouring your maps looking for containers or buy up virtual stocks of some failing company that will cost millions only to reduce your income those same companies  somehow have millions of dollars in reserve constantly to purchase stocks in your level 90 company chewing away at your profit margins sure you can turn off the features however they were introduced because users were complaining about how brainnumbingly easy the game is therefore people like me who were looking for a challenge would max out the difficulty unfortunately they chose the easy way out instead of actually sitting down and come up with a good game design they just made it more painful furthermore rare resources needed to build expansion modules on producttion buildings have to be farmed with quicklyrepetitive combat missions and uploads from a freaking freemium mobile game addon though granted the mobile game is well made and decently fun 3 hours into it i thought to myself wtf am i doing why am i spending my previous free time on a mobile game just to be able to improve my anno ingame buildings

the gameplay is decent sure its oversimplified but with the complex economy and global market i thought focusing more on the rate of production instead of pure quantities was a nice touch however even on the highest difficulty the gameplay was comparable to moderate level of anno 2070 which i adored by the 40th hour mark i was spending 60 of my time grinding through the same 6 combat missions to get rare resources to power my vast and quickly expanding citystates it became apparent with the latest update that all the old guard who made the franchise that we used to love have all either left or been overpowered by people who are not strategy gamers will they make money maybe will they change probably not theyll probably make more freemium games and dlcs will i ever buy another anno game only if the reviews are overwhelmingly possitive but i will no longer give them the benefit of the doubt and try out a game that isnt a blockbuster

rip in peace

pros the graphics scifi production lines are nice

#####

i bought this game on summer sale because i was concerned with the mixed reviews it had received from launch and i didnt want to pay full price for it on the chance it was bad  the only other anno game i own is anno 2070 which i enjoyed  i also enjoy this game  i feel too many reviewers are unfairly judging this game based on what they liked about anno 2070 without understanding that not every game is going to be a copy of its predecessor with better graphics  here is an indepth analysis of why i like the game and why i recommend people try it

in my opinion anno 2205 is a shift towards a simpler and more casual gamer which admittedly is a saavy business move as casual gamers are a much larger demographic  the things some people have been saying are negatives i actually find to be positives  the simplified supply chains for example  this game moves from micro level resource management to macro level resource management  the amount of micromanaging required in setting up tradesupply routes in anno 2070 meant i was spending more time managing those than i was actually enjoying the game  now the game takes care of that for me  i set up a tradesupply route andor start up a new settlement and instantly i see the recognizable trade ships from 2070 begin to head to and from my various warehouses automatically  its all aesthetic sure but before youd actually have to have set all those routes up yourself  personally i find the automation a welcome adjustment

the removal of combat from the standard gameplay has the same tone  nothing annoyed me more in anno 2070 than when a pirate fleet would arrive and mess up a trade route before my fleet could intercept them forcing me to then have to rebuild lost ships in order to resume my previous trade routes  ill agree that now there doesnt seem to be any penalty in not dealing with hostile forces i was expecting there might be some timers on combat missions or youd suffer some penalty  im glad there isnt because that would also have been annoying but still the lack of any necessity to deal with combat missions other than to collect iridium which seems to be the super resource i tend to run out of the quickest and achievements does seem a touch hollow but im generally okay with that

as for replayability  there is a valid point there  generally city builders are best when they have replayability  anno 2070 was ok with this  i played that game four times once as edengt once as gteden once as eden only and once as gt only i called that one hard mode  thing is outside that there wasnt much for me that made replayability interesting  im fine with the story mode  besides obviously with there already being two dlcs they intend on expanding playability through expansions which is in line with the way games are going these days

another thing i saw in a lot of negative reviews is that service buildings no longer have areas of effect and rather offer a flat service value i think maybe with some penalties for being close to each other andor distance away from population  havent actually paid that much attention to the nuance of it  i for one think the way it works now is overall better  sure it reduces some of the micromanaging aspects of city designing but this new way is the way city builders are going these days  ive seen this change in sim city games tropico caesar now anno generally speaking game designers are moving away from unnecessarily complex mechanics in favor of more accessible entertainment  again i feel the shift is towards accessing more of the casual gaming market of which i am a member so im okay with that  if you want harder then artificially make the game harder  say to yourself i wont build a community center building unless it is within a certain range of population structures and a certain distance from any other community centers  there youve increased your own difficulty while not impacting those who prefer to have fun rather than be restricted in their expansion options  or presuming the games permits it make a mod that does that  im a big fan of making games as accessible as possible in their base mode then allowing more hardcore gamers the ability to make it more difficult on their own terms

so thats my review  all told the game is beautiful i enjoyed the story aspects i found it accessible yet still challenging at times and id definitely say it was worth the price i paid  i hope others will give it a try and discover the same

#####

it has flaws but it is the bestlooking and bestdeveloped futuristic city building game right now as of 2020 so if you are into futuristic citybuilding games i know thats a bit too specific this is the only choice

#####

the fact that anno 2205 only has one game mode the story mode and no sandbox mode challenges or scenarios makes this a very boring and onedimensional anno game there is no arc no reason to replay the game and hand holding so severe itll make you sick to your stomach city building is much simpler now that buildings no longer need to be within distance of each other to gain effects just connected with a road 

you might think but what about space thats what the draw of the game was all about right the cover of the game is planet earth from space well your only space part of the game is building your own international space station sounds cool until you realize all youre doing is adding lego pieces to a glorified satellite in earths orbit but wait what about the interactions the amazing amount of detail involved that defines the anno series well its 2019 and theyre still little pixelated blocks with minimal movement when fully zoomed in on im referring to the games population 

as for customization itself you really have no wiggle room at all there is literally only one game mode and its to ultimately build a colony on the moon to get there you need to first build a space elevator from earth and along the way you will have instanced skirmishes instead of open world combat its just real bizarre how different this anno is compared to even the anno before it

dont buy this its not a good introductionreason to play the anno series

#####

cons
trading has been the main feature of all the anno games i have no idea why they removed the main feature of the game trading in anno 2205 is no longer simulated in the game its just clicking on two cities and linking them on a interface theres a single slider to determine how much goods moved rather than actually using ships that sailed around the actualy game map all the complex mechanics such as ship speed number of ships multi pick up drop off locations complex routes carry capicity distance pirtates are gone 

the combat levels are fairly boring and your are forced to play a lot of them to get resources crucial to building upgrades combat used to be a side effect of trading since there were pirates and you would protect them

pros
its still a fun game if you enjoy city simulation games even though this game lacks many of the best parts of the old anno games its still more complex than the vast majority of other city simulation games

man you can build some really pretty cities since some mechanics are simplified you can get away with making more aesthetic cities rather than functional the idea of colonizing the moon and orbit is also extremely fun and exiting

#####

i know its not usual but i never played any anno games before 2205 so for me the world and the habits of the game were a totally new experience maybe also in that matter i was genuenly amazed by the detailness and especially by the graphics of this game anno 2205 is one of the most beautiful graphics among all the strategy games i ever played as my profile shows im mainly a strategy game player so in that aspect i trully believe no one will be disappointed by the looks of this game the only downsides are the battle missions wich are needlesly long and not interesting enough mainly because the corporation building part of the game is much more refined and with the 4 different types of locations and resource gathering mechanics its a nicely complex experience i totally recomment this game just the 4k camera fly views alone worth the price  wich will need a relativly powerfull machine to run 

#####

i love all annos before this one and generally this type of game but i cant get over not being able to save it as i go along  also they have no sandbox so i have to play a whole story mode every time  when i screw up i have to start all over  im deeply disappointed

#####

i was going into this game with a sense of a much upgraded if not evolved version of anno 2070 instead i was met with a dumbed down anno that seems to be meant for beginners or a kiddy pool game meant to entice people who wouldnt normally play a game such as this unfortunately in doing this they have alienated the fan base for this franchise

keeping it 100  the break down
1 you have 3 zone types temperate artic lunaraka the moon
2 you have out of those 3 map zones you get to pick 3 different maps for each of those zone types no more random map spawns this matters little because you can unlock the other 2 for each zone in a single game play
3 there is no enemy instead you get a makeshift minigame that has you command a small fleet of ships running around and killing everything on the screen this you play at you leisure as it has no impact other than letting you get your hands on rare materials early in the game and after you reach the moon you will have no further need or even attempt
4 trade is done automatically and due to there being no enemy to worry about this is just icing on the cake of features removed note you get one ship per zone or in regards to the moon a rover this is used to claim areas islands and has little use beyond as all resource transport is automatic so you dont ever load the craft with anything just move it click and done
5 it works and is a beautiful game but with so many features removed it has the depth of an inflatable kids pool and thus has very little replay value much of what made anno 2070 great is gone

i give it a 65 out of 10 good for a play thru when bored but dont bother unless price is  50 off or greater

#####

i am mixed i strongly enjoyed the first 1012hrs of the game and then as i was leveling up my peeps to the last tier in the temperate zone it became such a huuuuge slog it starts to feel laggy every little thing i do requires constant tweaking and spamming of buildings here is an example of something you will do over and over and over

low on juice first try and find if you have one already placed which can be difficult once you have all three islands then check if you can fit more modules if so spam place them ohh no you ran out of fruit go see if you have fruits somewhere you can slap modules on o you cant ok clone an existing fruit find somewhere random that looks like it will fit the fruit farmfuture modules then repeat oh noo you are low on power ok go build a power plant ohhh no you are low on spots to put it either coastal slots or mountain slots ok maybe i can build the bigger power plant nope need more resources to fuel it oh no ran out of logisistics slots ok slap that down

and now you have about as much income as before you have more population and more supply routes but the exact same income the entire difficulty of the game is carefully balancing inputsoutputs but given no tools to do so effectively if you arent running on razor thin margins because constantly updating things one at a time each time you place 6 or so pop buildings then you will have low income you cant easily sell excess goods because there are only so many things for sale at once stock piles cant be managed only built up when you are full on storage your production buildings keep going costing you money energy workers and frustration

the only difficulty in teh game is trying to get your income ever so slightly higher by taking slight advantages of some research bonuses which by the way you can get into a corner if you build wide youll quickly realize the game really didnt want you to do that you are supposed to speacialize but now you gotta blow away half your space station to do it

the campaign really doesnt guide you through it this is fine i didnt mind the lack of handholding what i didnt expect was the lack of information on what i was building you can build something but not know the power worker or income cost to run it the campaign will financially ruin you if you dont pay attention selling things gives half value back so you can get ruined if you arent careful and commit to a new resource chain too soon i was frequently given loans to cover me before i got all the mechanics down and learned to ignore the quests until i had comfortable margins under me

combat is dreadful you will hate it it is incredibly reptitious no way to make fleet formations so your arty boats dont get killed in a few shots your big ship is slow but you wont want to micro because that would be so incredibly tedious every single time the stupid moon people invaded my islands i hated it multiple times i was invaded and just glumly watched as huge sums of cash was drained away as the attackme halfway through a production chain wiped out my income and sent me deep into the red only to be rewarded with a bailout playing on the 2nd difficulty

the stock market makes no sense at all as soon as you enter it the game basically warns you the game mechanic can ruin the whole game by telling you it is making a backup why make a system that is so easy to mess up and ruin the player experience idk anyway i waited until i finished the campaign all of a sudden i got millions of dollars where did it come from no idea now a share is for sale the fuck is that good bad i dunno i outbid everyone apparenlty into the millions

then nothing i didnt get teh share the fuck i just lost the magical money i got then the ai bid up another of my share and another what the fuck i waste all my influence just shutting them down then they start buying shares of each other for millions repeatedly where are they getting this money idk is the espionage stuff worth it costs too much influence

the game is stressful as it is just slowly pulling your logisistics network through larger production chains but without the tools to make it scale with the size of the map the challenge that comes from that increasing difficulty is offset by the fact that i have to wait for each area to load every single time i switch areas so if i need to go ot the moon tundra and temperate i have to wait for each area to load every time while i tweak some logistics network stuff

the whole game is like this it feels so fun at first because it feels like you are building to something and surely the game will give you better tools to manage your corporation this just isnt true the game gets unnecessarily difficult because of a lack of clear information on what things will do before you place it 

i love strategy games and i love logistics games like factorio oxygen not included civ programming games etc etc etc this game should hit my niche but it is too frustrating and has too much goalpost moving that makes progression feel nonexistent

#####

i wont say this game is bad its a fine game but as someone who waited 4 months for the game i truly expected more especially when i played anno 2070 before and absolutely fell in love with it there are so many good features in anno 2070 have been removed in 2205 to me anno 2070 is a 9510 anno 2205 is only 7510 here are a few things i believe the game missed

1 endless skirmish mode i just dont understand in anno 2070 you can customize your game choose how many islands in the map pick your opponents and all kind of other stuff what did they do with all of these there is actually a campaign section in anno 2070 with many different missions for you to try what does anno 2205 have one single campaign what the heck was that

2 the rts element i love the rts element in anno 2070 you have to save every single bit of your income and material to build your ships with your army you can protect your city and trade routes it all feels so meaningful what have they done with that awesome system in anno 2205 they separate it from the main city building game and what we have is a boring repetitive mini game that i just refuse to do any more after a few mission

3 diplomacy no more diplomacy no more factions all characters now basically serve the same function provide goods for trades and give you those boring missions over and over again while in anno 2070 every character is different and plays a very clear role hector was an annoying pirate who wont stop harassing your trading activities thor has a mighty army with him and can destroy you with ease the oil guy the scientist the trader they all serve a very unique purpose the missions they gave you can have direct impact to your relationships that awesome diplomacy system was wiped out completely in 2205 now you are all alone 

4 no multiplayer im not a huge fan of multiplayer in anno but some do to me its not a problem

all in all the game just feel lack i refuse to believe this is all they came up with after successfully making a game like anno 2070 the only reason i gave this game a 75 is because of that awesome moment when you went to the moon and of course the beautiful graphic and building design

#####

ive been playing the anno series since the beloved 1503 and loved it ever since the predecessor of this part 2070 struck my interest with its rather futuristic setting when i head that this part would feature fusion reactors and all sorts of scifi stuff i didnt recoil like a lot of people but looked forward to it
but boy was i disappointed

positives first 
the graphics look amazing and the sound design is good aswell 
the idea to have multiple sectors to manage seemed interesting at fisrt but was poorly executed
the setting was also something i could see myself liking
having a moon colony is kind of cool 

thats it thats all the good i have to say about this part
why
no cooperative mode
no traditional ship trading routes to manage
no guessing and tinkering how much of a resource a farm produces in a given amount of time and how to perfectly set them up
long loading times between sectors like 2 minutes if you have a lot of stuff going on
no more islands to build new settlements on
no more combat in the regular world just in predefined sectors with little to no impact on your colonies
generally i found it to be too easy you dont have to do any learning by doing which i liked a lot

the dlc politic of ubisoft wasnt particulary great aswell but i want really involved with the aftermath so i wont rant about it any further here

if you liked previous anno titles stay away from this one maybe they wont bodge up 1800

#####

while i dig the move from micromanagement to macromanagement this has been really oversimplified 

1 you do not need trade networks in between islands
2 you do not need to connect your recoursesmanufacturing to warehouses
3 productions times are instant as in all factories ect will produce the commodity directly into the island cluster pool
4 trade between island cluster pools is done by automated trade routes that do not require anything even ships
5 combat has been removed from city developments ect and it is now done only in combat areas
6 you must do combat areas to get recourses for building building modules
7 you do not make your own combat units instead you are provided with units for free


i do like some new mechanisms however such as dynamic viewing of required and oversaturated goods

#####

they removed access to both online multiplayer and even offline single player of anno 2070 no doubt that act will come here soon

do not buy ubisoft games

#####

needs a second login on ubisoft client

ubisoft client needs user creation but when i try to create user it doesnt work it returns the error system is unavailable  therefore cannot play

stay away from spending 40euros on this better drink 40 beers with those moneyor 80

#####

the game bugged resulting in me being unable to exit and i had to force quit which resulted in 12 hours of gametime lost after redesigning pretty much every map and supply chain i had running this happened because they dont let you save on your computer and you have to sync with their uplay servers however if the now unsupported game bugs and doesnt let you quit like what happened to me youre out of luck thats completely unacceptable

#####

at the time i write this review i have spend about 140 hours on anno 2205 when i examine the store page i see that many people are disappointed in anno 2205 and it has the mixed user review status i personally feel that this is not entirely fair so i would like to dedicate this review to replying to some of the more common complaints made by people in other reviews now before i begin i would like to point out that i greatly respect your own opinion but i also ask of you to respect mine

starting out many people compare this game to anno 2070 the previous game in the anno series this is ofcourse understandable and i think that noone will disagree with me when i say that a person who is expecting a new version of anno 2070 will likely be disappointed because it is not anno 2070

however we should ask ourselves does that make this game a bad game well opinions seem to differ on this but i myself would say no 

this game is not a reskinned anno 2070 it is a whole new approach to an existing genre i like some of it but i also dislike some of it overall however i really like this game with my current play time i have payed about 50 cents gold edition for an hour of playtime which i feel is an acceptable price

so let me begin
1 the storage system i hear from people that they dont like the ratio based storage system which they feel is shallow  i can understand it if you would prefer a absolutebased storage system but in previous anno games i found myself using an implicit rating system where i increase production if my production of good x if my storage was decreasing if you feel that making this system explicit is making the shallow then that is your opinion however i strongly disagree

2 the transport system the system used to manage trade routes is different where you no longer have to build ships instead you hire then i agree that this made inter sector transport simpler to manage but there are also differnt oportunities for optimizing for example a load just to big for a small ship can better be transported in 2 small ships then 1 big ship 

3 lack of rts play compared to anno 2070 perhaps there is less rts play however for me anno has always been a city builder not an rts game if you want a rts game then there are plenty of better alternatives here on steam that are cheaper then anno 2205 or anno 2070 

4 no random map generator limits replayability well if you feel this way then that is understandable however the random map generator of anno 2070 was in my opinion verry disappointing where maps generated under similar settings are virtually the same except for maybe their exact position on the map the maps in anno 2205 however are hand crafted and are actually different from eachother 

5 a common complaint on the forums is i can go afk for a week come back and my town is still ok this is true however the same could also be said for the older annos for example my building strategy in anno 2070 is one of stability in fact the only thing i have to do in order to keep my cities running is to make sure i have the raw materials which practically boils down to using those silly drill things to make sure i can pull enough copper out of the ground

6 no multiplayer yes this anno game has no multiplayer yet and people seem to be really on the fence about this i myself am not that interested in anno multiplayer because most of my games take a workday of playtime before they start to get interesting for the people who hold off on buying this game i would say how much of the time relative in this case of your total play time will you actually spend in multiplayer is this 50 or 5 and if it is 5 is it still that improtant to have this feature in this game

again this is not meant to critise the opinions of others it is meant to formulate a reply with my opinion to some of the things people have pointed out in their own review 

summarizing
i have played both anno 2070 and anno 2205 and i like both games now if you wish to go for the more rtsy experience i would recommend anno 2070 however if you want to go for the city builder experience then i would recommend anno 2205 

on a sidenote ubisoft recently released a survey in which they ask for your opinion on how they can improve this game i would urge everyone who has tried this game to participate so the game can be improved links to this survey can be found on the steam forums 

thank you for reading my review

h1is it any goodh1

i really like it  i realise that isnt exactly helpful so to put this in some sort of context many people arent enjoying it for the same reasons i am enjoying it  as a background i very much enjoyed annos 2070 1404 and the rather older 1602 and plowed hundreds of hours into these games  i was rather worried that this new game would simply be a reskinned anno 2070 but im happy to say its not  there are many fresh ideas that change it just enough to make it feel like a new and different game yet retaining the anno feel  the developers have removed some of the more menial micromanagement tasks  contentiously because many players are complaining about that now

the graphics are as gorgeous as shown in the screenshots and the three different areas of temperate land the arctic and the moon have been incredibly recreated  one issue people are running into is performance i have a 6core i7 with a 6gb nvidia titan black together with 16gb memory and even at a basic 1080p resolution ive had to pull back the settings from ultra  the first game ive ever had to reduce  ubisoft has recommended playing with a gtx 680 or higher to get the best out of the game and i can see why  use steams 2hour refund window to see how it runs on your pc


h1if youve never played an anno game beforeh1

ubisoft has clearly worked hard to make the user interface much more friendly  however this game explains even less than the tutorial of anno 2070 did  for example there are no onscreen prompts to help a newcomer in towing a vessel with their command ship do you leftclick rightclick or what  do you click your vessel first or the ship you are meant to be towing   and how do you know which vessel to tow  us oldies will know that you highlight the mission look for the orange dot on the map that appears and head for that  newcomers might flounder because a lot of very basic stuff has been left to players memories of previous games

personally i would recommend first dipping into the still gorgeous and highly enjoyable and now cheap anno 1404  simply because the detailed campaign teaches you how to play all the annos pretty much  if not ask in the forums for opinions from other newcomers because most reviews seem to be written by experienced players


h1if youve played previous anno gamesh1

anno 2205 is getting a very mixed reception because there have been significant changes  for the most part i really like them but many people dont so ill list the main changes in the hope it helps you decide whether you will like it or not

b1  no random map seedsb  i can see why because maps are fully 3d rendered with incredible dams places for gargantuan bridges and it would be very difficult to generate these procedurally  as a result you basically have 9 fixed maps from which to choose  its not many but more will be coming via dlc such as tundra and orbit

b2  no multiple warehouses and transportation of goodsb  everything now must be connected by roads to your coastal warehouse and the costs you incur are determined by how far goods must travel you can place localised transport depots to reduce these  again i really love this change  its more realistic and in anno 2070 it was annoying having to pockmark my maps with warehouses just to make all areas of the terrain buildable  thats a thing of the past now

b3 no more town centresb  nope  you dont have to build within a small circular radius now  this i think is a fantastic change

b4  no more fields for farms etcb  i found fields cluttered my city designs in anno 2070 so am not missing them particularly but its made some people unhappy  instead your production factories now have modular addons to increase their output reduce their energy consumption and such and they bolt onto the building in the same style as simcity 2013

b5  no continuous map modeb  this is a bit of a concern but what seems to have happened is that the developers have this time merged the campaign into what is actually a freeform world  imagine playing a continuousmap game as in anno 2070 when up pops one of the once separate side missions right in your new world  its making people think there is just campaign mode when its actually just a map that you can play how you like  

b6 no multiplayer in this oneb  im perfectly fine with that i dont like multiplayer and ubisoft claims that the multiplayer part of anno 2070 was only played by the tiniest percentage of users  if you enjoyed anno 2070s multiplayer this is something that might be of concern to you

b7 combat has been moved to its own mapb  this is so that nuisance enemies dont bother people who really just want to build relaxing worlds  however you really need to partake in some of the battles in order to win resources you can use in your own map  people have criticised the combat but beyond it being in its own map which i dont mind too much the combat seems to be quite an improvement on anno 2070s combat but it is still very basic as it always was in anno games


h1in summaryh1

anno 2205 has been received well with 81 on metacritic at the time of writing but many steam reviewers are panning it for some significant changes to the anno formula the biggest are listed above so existing anno gamers will need to decide for themselves using steams 2hour refund window  i love it personally  in my opinion most of what was annoying has been removed to be replaced with better features  i am a bit concerned about the map limitation no randomseeded maps any longer and performance is a tad hefty but there have been no bugs and it is a gorgeous game  incredible to look at and enjoyable to play

#####

i have never written a review before nor ever felt the need to write a review  however with the launch of anno 2205 that changed  i know this is a way for the developers to read about what players think about their game so i would like to put my opinion out there  this review is not hating on anno however it highlights differences between this one and previous ones  

now im sure people are going to challenge my opinion because i have less than two hours in the gameas of launch day  however i own almost every other anno to date either virtually or hard copy so i think i have a pretty good knowledge base when it comes to city building micromanaging and fully enjoying an anno game

on a good note the game runs beautifully on ultra high graphics  the textures look astounding from buildings to oceans to mountains  anno 2205 is a more casual new user friendly game compared to other annos14041701 2070 which i assume because the developers want the game to target a wider audience  however anno 2205 feels like a dumbed down version of previous annos

what do i mean by that the challenge of building a city is gone in this anno  instead you are building a corporation to fight for resources and land in temperate artic and lunar zones  yes there is still building of houses managing of energy and money but many of the tasks which made anno stand out are gone

the concept of storage is goneedit changed per say same with overproduction and underproduction  in previous annos you had to balance amounts of materials you obtained otherwise you would end up with a surplus or a deficit of material  if you mined too much or too little there were repercussions  also this anno has removed nonrenewable resources all together for example i can mine coal out of a mine until the end of time whilst in previous anno games youd eventually run out of coal on one island and need to switch to another  

anno 2205 limits the user to where they can build on land zones for example you want to build a algae farmwhich is built on the coastline it must be placed on a spot which gets highlighted for the user when they try to build the algae farm  you cannot choose where the building is placed on the coast like you could in previous annos  in simple terms freebuild has been limited  

this may be the biggest one for me  no skirmish or multiplayer  for 80 i do not want to play a campaign only  i enjoyed having the ability to create a randomly generated world to play on  it keeps the game interesting as you dont ever see the same map twice  the ability to add or delete ais and make the game as challenging as the user liked  being able to spend hundreds of hours with friends building and cooperating that is what defined anno as my favorite city builder of all time  without these features the game will become boring very fast for many players because no one likes repetitive things

now i will be updating this review as i keep playing the game as i have only played a short amount of time into the game  if other modes to play are released in the future as well this review will drastically change  however until updates happen and changes to the game occur i will have trouble enjoying this anno like i enjoyed the rest of them 


edit 11315answers to comments cleared up some things
just some random answers

for example i can mine coal out of a mine until the end of time whilst in previous anno games youd eventually run out of coal on one island and need to switch to another well that was also removed in 2070 so you cant really comment on that

the player would have to build somethingor buy it from traders to obtain more coal on the island which means you had to plan ahead for when you ran out  and it added a miniscule amount of coal compared to what the island started with


you cannot choose where the building is placed on the coast like you could in previous annos in simple terms freebuild has been limited  im not really sure what you mean by this but its not like you could place buildings where ever the fuck you wanted in old annos coastal buildings especially only went in certain places

coastal buildings can only be placed in designated slots now there are no beaches to fill full of fisheries etc like in anno 2070  so i guess you could say its like anno 2070 crab fishing now where there were designated areas only for crab fishing 


there was no challenge in anno 2070 either when it comes to managing production and overproduction all you had to do is look it up online so in essence i see no problem with removing a bit of tedium of looking up something online

i guess i never looked it up online but by taking it out it still simplified the game too much at least in my opinion  and i will be playing this game all today to see what else i can say about it

15 hours played  rofl
kys it was launch day bud i had to put out something of a review to give advance notice to other anno players to changes made

#####

if you have played previous anno games and loved playing single player then this is the best anno yet  if you played previous anno games and loved playing multiplayer this is the worst anno yet

#####

bought this on sale 75 off ult edition after enjoying anno 2070 for years and years i spent years looking at this and not being sure but the game is fantastic it improves massively over 2070 and its altogether more fun more interesting and more enjoyable to look at

 your higher level citizens rely on resources from different sectors so theres a constant back and forth between them and youre playing each sector constantly to keep upgrading and growing id use on an ssd to help the loading
 no more awful trade route micromanagement you produce a good and a factory can use it anywhere in that sector no matter what island its on only caveat is the routes that move goods between sectors but theyre easy and simple to set up no more making a dozen trade ships to move vegetables to one island and health food back
 each sector map has a unique powerful project you work on as your company grows which keeps you focused on something other than just grow big town
 the growing of the citycorporation is constant throughout the course of the game rather than restarting for each mission like in 2070
 seeing quest steps have results in the game world like the arctic camp set up on the ice as they prepare to blow a shipping path through it or the non interactable security boats patrolling the water around my dams after i transport them there add a surprising amount of life and charm to the game anno is good for that
 the combat is very simple arcadey but fun some see this as a negative but i enjoy taking a break from optimising production chains and city layout to just guide my ships through a path of fun easy destruction
 calamity events something going wrong on your normal maps lots of different types and can break up the monotony but could also be an annoying distraction if youre in the middle of something
 looong game  im expecting to take close to a hundred 100 hours to complete this playthrough take that as you will
 only 4 maps for normal combat missions so it gets tedious and a bit boring after a while but you could also ignore them
 the special resources used for upgrading ships and space elevators are a bit meaningless  you cant produce them but get an endless supply from quests and missions and in the ultimate edition at least i got 500 of each one for free so i never had to worry about having enough
 uplay i cant stress this enough ubisoft and their drm practises often ruin their games be warned that its a hit or miss whether it will work properly for you but i got my game to install and launch without a hitch i was already logged into my uplay account beforehand if that helps
 just a pet peeve you cant build a space elevator at the north pole it wouldnt physically be possible and why the hell would you build a space elevator and then the next upgrade is a space shuttle launch pad on the ground next to the cable the sci fi nerd in me is furious but its a game so shrug

but yeah grab it on sale give it a try  uplay

#####

even though they made the game simpler in a bunch of ways adding the extra planets to manage was a nice comprimise still enjoyed it and got to the highest company level in 20 hours of casual gameplay dont start the stock market unless you wanna cry

in all my years on steam i have never taken the time to write a review for any game but this game really needs it do not buy this game it is a total waste of money if you are expecting the next entry in the anno series or a worthy sequel to anno 2070 it is significantly dumbed down and the amazing depth and variety of gameplay that 2070 had is completely gone all youre doing is plopping more and more residences in neat little rows and endlessly and aimlessly balancing your production chains to provide the goods they want where the only consideration is having enough factories of a certain type without any of the intricacies of 2070 trade transporting goods between islands etc again do not buy

#####

it was fun as long as it lasted for all of about 20 hours afterwards there is no real motivation to play it again and its kinda sad to charge 60 for 20 hours worth of play which got about tedious after 10

the game is to simple and has no real challenges but it is beautiful

after long play times it starts to bog down the computer and so forces a restart so it might need some further patching to avoid this

#####

first this is a very good city builder game with ressource management
second this is the worst anno game

as a city builder this game is perfect you have to manage chain production to level up your people wich grant you acces to more advance stuff as in any anno game

but they have taken out the war from the main gameplay area to a very poor combat map this prevent any ressource war and this is a major gameplay feature in any anno game

still this is a good game it shouldnt have been called anno


#####

is it still an anno game if you

 remove fertilities
 simplify trade  remove vehicles time delays v little need to buy or sell in the game
 remove disasters 
 have unlimited resources
 remove research vehicle and warehouse upgrades 
 remove choice of factions 
 remove pollution 
 give player ability to freely move all buildings without penalty
 remove combat defensive offensive building and strategy from main game have an rts minigame instead
 remove multiplayer
 remove randomised maps and challenges



#####

wish they brought 1800 back to steam

so what is anno 2205 it is a supply chain management city builder sim the vast majority of the game is managing supply chains for various resources while maintaining a positive income depending on how good you are at the game you can end up waiting very long periods of game time to do anything because your income is only a hundred credits a minute or so and everything costs a lot more than 100 credits or you can very rapidly expand

how do you make credits your income is entirely based off of taxes the game is balanced so that your temperate regions will generally have a positive income while the arctic and lunar regions will eat credits but provide resources you can ship to your temperate regions to make more money by upgrading your population

pros 
supply chain manager 
more forgiving than other games in the series
combat can be mostly ignored if you do not have the dlc that allows your regions to be invaded
you get the feeling of success that comes with expanding your company from nothing to controlling a number of regions
game does not end as you can always improve on your optimization
signifiicantly variable difficulty
pretty graphics 
campaign is not pressing but has a truly awesome reward
each region is slightly different in management because of regional projects bonuses and negatives
addictive for people who like to optimize  perfect stuff

cons
limited combat that is repetitive 
not a lot of variance in building appearance
gameplay can get repetitive quickly for those who do not like managing supply chains
stock market dlc can be very annoying in spite of large benefits
space station dlc will drive you insane if you like to have full supply everywhere
tundra dlc gives you a benefit that in most cases is actually a detriment
multiplayer gameplay does not exist

this is personally my favorite anno game because it allows for a larger degree of error in supply chain management than the other games so it is more forgiving for people who do not enjoy micromanaging but still like supply chain management i also do not often play multiplayer in anything so the lack of multiplayer does not bother me in the least



#####

as a longtime fan of the game since 1602  i can safely say that this was the game that ruined it  having multiple maps and no combat in each city is awful  im really sad that i have to write this but the game is straightup ruined

#####

the game is great  i had a problem starting it  if you already have a ubi account you must close it first then start the game and log in again to pair the accounts

#####

ubisoft why do you hate us why are you forcing this launcher that you are breaking so that we cant play the games we already bought why do you think we start to avoid you

the game itself is not bad its more theme parkish than other installments
but the launcher is just a killjoy

#####

the ubisoft launcher wont authenticate my purchase waste of money no tonly is it disgusting having to suddenly login having to deal with this crap when it doesnt even work is just not worth the hassle

#####

wheres my anno content  its gone 
 
no more military enemies are gone you just load mission maps
no more economy you gather goods from the entire map no more transports needed
no more diplomacy because allies are gone too npc offer you missions instead enjoy 
no more random maps trololol theres nothing else than the campaign

worst anno game ever 

#####

this is the only iteration of the anno series i did not like purely eyecandy with a shallow gameplay
i did not play beyond the vanilla game but i had purchased the season pass obviously i had my expectations up way too high 

pros 
quality graphics

cons
too easy  dumbed down version of the series
loadingtime

update

this review is for those who are already familiar with the anno series this isnt my first language but i did bother to write this all up to give a warning for anyone who hasnt already preorded it this is not a clear buy it but merely a description of how things have changed sometimes quite radically which can be a huge turnoff for those who expect the same gameplay like in all the anno games before

short and superficial summary 
limitless ressources no free harbor building  everything is now confined to slots just like mines and quarries decent graphics surprisingly bug free as of now smallish individual map sizes less inflexible production complexes but predefined amounts of inputoutpot more individual tinkering and upgrading of buildings with modules combat is optional and plays out on separate maps also no ai bots

i have always been a great fan of the anno series even the fact that the 2 recent games can only be played with uplay didnt exactly bother me so no negative review just because of that i want to exclusive talk about the gameplay experience i had in the first few hours of playing anno 2205

just as stated by the publisher there have been radical changes to the game as we know it certain elements that every game up to this point contained that provided a coherent structure to the series and were an integral part of the overall gameplay are now gone or replaced by new means production layouts and ressource management


the first big change no more storage limits and heavily reduced penalties for low stockpiles all ressources except a very few building materials are part of a flow dynamic overproduction is ok perfect satisfaction is great as it means that your production runs efficient underproduction has an instant impact  although not as heavy like in the rest of the series  and should be avoided your civil society wont crumble anymore just because your ceos are low on service robots they get mildly annoyed depending on the amount of underproduction and tax rates are reduced

all buildings either provide or need several of new ressources in different combinations money for maintenance and building in the first place energy construction components different types of them just like wood bricks etc and the new workforce which is basically your population that gets substracted for every new production building additionaly theres logistics which is used just like workforce but is provided by what was known as the basic warehouses which are now dumbed down to simple areaofeffect logistics centers without any real physical interaction of drones and production buildings although this isnt really a bad thing warehouse spam in 2070 because drones arent fast enough with picking up wares was a minor flaw which the developers have solved quite nifty

furthermore all nonrenewable ressources are gone you get a certain amount of building slots per map  just like in anno 2070  but instead of riverside buildings you can now utilize seaside slots yes slots no more free building of customized harbor areas the only limitation to ressource exploitation is the amount of slots for mining and coastal extraction

these changes radically simplify the game huge edit here in some areas it feels more like a puzzle build this stress a ressource build production building for said ressource something else is now in low supply build another thing it is sometimes more unnerving than a challenge but thats just my personal opinion

edit i said in my original post that i assume the rest of the game will be quite like the first zone temperate island after some additional hours spent with this game i have to partially correct my statement the core dynamic of flowbased ressource management doesnt change but that is no surprise what does indeed change is the way settlement has to be laid out arctic regions recquire placement of houses close to industrial buildings since they need to be heated by thermal power which is provided in a small radius
a similar amount of rethinking is needed on the lunar colonies where shields against meteors have to be built
all three types of settlements have to be connected by trade routes since a zone needs a ressource that it cant produce itself  similar to the different islands of the games predecessors trade routes dont come cheap especially for space routes this changes the focus of the game more on efficiency management and less precise ressource storage management as radical as this change is it does offer a refreshing innovation to the series this new approach is reflected in the way that production buildings are built individual industrial buildings can be upgraded via two types of connected modules each recquiring a special ressource but ill get later to that in the combat section that improve the output or reduce demand on energy workforce or logistics 
less inflexible production complexes that should be closely packed together and basically only work efficiently within a confined ratio of buildings more precise tinkering with input and output

now to a completely different subject combat and ai interaction
if you dont want to fight you dont have to since you are now mostly alone on your mapzone there arent any direct competitors that try to snatch important islands the other coorporations have their own zones which you can buy for a hefty amount of credits your own assets  islands buildings trade routes  arent in any way endangered military conflicts are played on separate maps with ships you dont even have to build as i said these conflicts are optional they can provide you with additional special ressources graphene irridium oil that are needed for upgrade modules each conflict map offers a primary goal mostly just destroying a target additionally there a optional targets which mostly play out the same destroy something and then collect stuff or just collect stuff and destroy something on the way there
as openminded as i want to be concerning the gameplay changes this is my biggest issues with the game i really like the threat of disrupted trade routes or blockades and the additional ressource management logistic planning and spending that went into a considerable defenceattack force as demanding as the overall efficiency management may be this dumbed down combat puts it all kinda in perspective  at least for more competitive players like me but there are certainly quite some players who will welcome this change

as stated in the summary the graphics are fine but not overwhelming i have a decent albeit older rig that can run the game on high settings althoug after starting on the moon the third zone my fps and the simspeed tend to drop sometimes since im not focusing much on graphics in such games this is all i can honestly tell
to my surprise i havent encountered any bugs and im still waiting for my first crashtodesktop i had now problems starting or running this game but maybe im just lucky


to come to an end i still can not wholeheartedly recommend buying this game there are a lot of refreshing changes demanding new approaches to certain problems  which i really like parts of the game are so simplified that long time players of the series may regret putting their money into this

and to address some critique from the comments i am very well aware that 30mins playing anno2205 wont provide any deep insight into every feature the game has to offer but some core featuresflaws can be accessed in this time frame i dont need to spend 2060 hours to write a qualified review on the most basic features nevertheless i greatly appreciate any constructive criticism

#####

people who dump on this mostly because they like micro management like placement etc thats not the core of the game though the good parts of the strategy remains the rich stories are here the wonderful graphics are here the economy and math all works i really love this tightly planned and well thought out version of anno it kept all the good things and combed off the frizzy click heavy bits youll atleast love some aspect if not most if not all of this game please give it a try

#####

the game is awesome but ubisoft stlauncher just wont let me run it 910 times wasting 3040 minutes just to launch the game thnx fng ubihst

#####

i dont normally do reviews but thought i would do one for this game

firstly this is not really a comparable anno game its more of a relaxing city builder thats about enjoying the atmosphere and seeing your city develop its not going to challenge you in the same way anno 14041800 might and there are very few ways to totally lose 

that doesnt make it bad however as it without any doubt has the best music graphics and atmosphere of any anno game its also a lot more laid back and relaxing and as someone who usually sticks to grand strategy that can be a great thing its fun engaging beautiful and overall just a great game

basically its a awesome game and my fav of the series but shouldnt be judged as an anno game
8510

#####

a city building game with a possible future for the real world


so what is anno series to begin with originally called dawn of discovery in north america this series has been around for a long time according to wuppo another steam user it is even older than that in north america and i have confirmed it is even one of the earlier games can be found on steam anyways at its heart anno series is basically a city building simulator with missions and quests to complete stuff 

this version of the game 2205 unlike its last predecessor 2070 has a few changes at the time of this writing it has no multiplayer in the game nor does it include a sandbox  mode even though if you finish the main storyline it becomes sorta a sandbox game the only multiplayer online features for this game at this moment is voting and world trade market prices both these things take info from all players on the game and either increases prices on goods or loweres them also it takes census of votes from everyone similiar to the voting system found on 2070

the game can be addictive if your into city builder games be aware this game uses uplay by ubisoft since they made the game uplay requires a account to use the game on it if you do not have one when you 1st try the game it will ask you to make an account forcing you into making one for playing this game but this is not uncommon for other uplay games as 2070 also requires the same thing uplay honestly has improved than it previously was as for me personally i have used uplay in the past and it has been worst than it is now including outages and even not recognizing your game keys or even purchased games now it seems these problems has been fixed on uplay and is much more stable 

one other thing is that there is a app that requires a smartphone since i dont own a smartphone i cannot say how this app or how it works in the game but i imagine it does what it says gives additional rare building stuff to use

i recommend this game if you like city buildersif not a fan of city builders please avoid getting or buying this game also if you can buy on sale with all dlcsas they add alot of more content to the game than what the base game contains and give you more options in the game

thanks to wuppo for pointing out the information on how old the series actually is

#####

holy f im a gamer for 30 years now and this one has taken the cake for testing my patience i havent even played the game i cant ive exhausted everything in the 20 minutes i owned this game f ubisoft and now i have the headache of having to unf my google account now

1 buy game installed it through steam
2 boot game loads up uplay
3 create new ubisoft account with my email address and pw
4 login asks for google authentication code never used this in my life 
5 reluctantly install it take 10 minutes to setup cause it wants to install on every google device i own sigh
6 log into uplay again put in code rejects code let it refresh try again fails wth try again lets code lapse and tries again fails maybe something was off tries again the moment new code comes up and tries again and again fails fails and account suspended 
7 goes to support page for help has to log in account also suspended on website clicks cant login link recovers account through email account still suspended unable to chat cause i cant log in 
8 waits for timeout to lapse tries to login to uplay again fails as expected now tries recovery key as directed fails tries 4 more all fail
9 goes to website to login site asks for authentication code about to lose my s but keeps calm and tries everything i tried on step 6 over again nothing works 
10 posting this before i uninstall and return the first game ive ever returned in steam because i cant even contact support for help

#####

tldr no no no no nuhuh no  irrespective of the actual game average can be worth on deep sale look at who is selling it and do the decent thing for yourself and gaming and dont give them any money 

dont buy this no matter how good you think it is at some point some useless corpo twit at ubisoft will take away your single player game because youve had enough time to play it now or some such nonsense  who knows what the justification is  neutering it bit by bit from singleplayer offline dlc hollowing out the content until they likely pull the plug entirely see anno 2070 as in the better futuristic anno game 

somehow ubisoft manages to continually display more disregard for their customers than the tobacco industry dont reward them by gambling your money away on their games and the rinserepeat nature of a lot of their offerings might also give you pause i can even forgive them for cramming their pointless stupid idiotic launcher down your throat because all big companies hate their customers fine but look into their record on liveservice monetization nfts etc  ubisoft is just evil they are actually worse than ea anything bad ea has done ubisoft has done the same and then they entertained options for being even more awful 

im done buying their stuff not that i really care about another recycled ac or farcry or whatever remember when those games were innovative but im just mad because ubisoft has managed to buy a lot of really good cherished ip homm anno settlers etc and then  well if you like those games you know what theyve done a pox on all their houses

#####

for me the game is fine thats my first time with the anno franchise so i didnt have any expectations especially taking into consideration that i bought the game on some serious discount

however i absolutely do not recommend the fucking ubisoft launcher that i had to install to play a fucking single player game that is absurd

#####

the series is defined by its random generation of locations and its replayability on top of its campaign and challenges

then ubisoft decide to forget all that and create a new game that places you on a path of linear expansion that only offers a fraction of replayability at the end of the game 

i have played through what i deem to be the full experience i dont plan to put any more time in to this gamei will only return if the dlc expands on the game to include some form of random game mode

#####

hardcore anno fans hate this game because it greatly simplifies goods transportation if youre coming from anno 1800 there is no trade routes between individual islands only between regions all trade routes are chartered routes

its like an anno for newcomers  casual city builder players youll still lose tons of hours its still really fun honestly its 100x less of a headache than anno 1800 the biggest downsides are you cant play sandbox mode and you cant manually save youre essentially playing permanently in ironman mode 

call me crazy but i really enjoyed the fauxrts ship combat missions i dunno its something i never knew i needed and something i now want fully fleshed out in a game anno city building with proper dawn of war 2esque combat missions

#####

ok i can understand why this is getting mixed reviews and mine is going to be no different as has been said before i wish there was a meh option in the reviews

there are good aspects to this game visually it is pleasing as far as scope is concerned its the biggest one of the series  and yet it somehow feels smaller than its previous incarnations it managed to put each aspect of gameplay into a little box that the player enters when they want to do it so battles are one box each city is another box with these tendrils of traderoutes connecting them theres little evidence that they even coexist other than those routes and they exist purely as numbers

in some ways this is no longer an anno game theyve actually taken a step backwards in technology because production and supply is no longer realtime so the game kinda becomes a spreadsheet that you have to balance up

that said the game itself is one you can spend a bit of time on the growth available is the largest scale in an anno game and the production system is probably one of the most difficult to balance and anno is a game for people who love to set up systems and balance the books so the right idea was got just not implemented very well all in all whilst the game is fun it feels kind of soulless compared to the previous incarnations

im not going to recommend this game even though i do find it quite playable because im assuming that people reading this are new to the anno series and if someone asked me id tell them to buy 1404 or even 2070 for a game with a bit more flavour and a feel like your cities are more than simply money generation centres rather than go straight to this one

#####

wont load as cant verify the ownership of the game


nb and now ubisoft wont do anything as apparently its signed up to a different email account because i had to change my email as i was hacked many years ago

#####

this is quite a boring and repetetive game i tried to return it because of technical issues but steam refused granted it was time for a new video card so i upgraded my systemwow was it not worth it it now works fine but the graphics are nothing special and the gameplay is simple and laborious i cant recommend anything about this game i did give it many hours hoping there would be some interesting twist but no just more of the same the reported hours may be a bit misleading as it was not uncommon to leave it running and walk away to do something more fun like wash the floor

#####

i played the game when it was first released and through the years a few times at the beginning it didnt live up to the other anno games imho playing it now with all patches and addons it feels like a different world the options are massive and the idea to manage multiple areas with different aspects is absolutely triggering the i will come to bed in a minute just want to complete that project feeling a warning though dont activate stock markets it completely changes the pace of the game without stock market there is nothing to fear absolutely no pressure and no stress  very relaxing with stock market you can never leave your pc because another stock auction may threaten your company shares thus destroying at least the effort of a few hours on the other hand if you are up to the task the stock market opens up an interesting challenge but i personally feel it is not that well designed from the mechanic the bonusses are great tough read a guide before activating it i can definitely recommend the game it keeps me motivated even beyond the main story arc 

#####

i had hundreds of hours into anno 2070 and early titles this ones lack of logistic process eg road transporation completely kills the fun as you no longer need to plan the placement of roads and ports all you need to do is two things satify demands and complete miniquests turning the game into a tapandgo for iphone

#####

ubisoft is forcing the player to install the uplay store seperately to steam and also register and be online with it when playing

they install denuvo

it is very annoying to have to go through all of this

#####

this version is getting a lot of flak for daring to finally change annos mechanics if you are looking for a strict yetanotherannowithsamemechanics this is not for you 

however ironically this is hands down the best anno experience for me streamlining the logistics anno hasnt really never been able to give much tools for that works perfectly for me and now its a strict production and space optimization simulation

perfect consider this a spinoff of the original series and its easier to objectively consider the games overall value

the price is a bit steep but damn its beatiful to look at the terrain is incredibly detailed or at least manages to convey a really good impression of detail ui is also so much better than the clusterfudge of previous anno 2070 also combat is now done in their completely isolated missions and works for me it has always been the least interesting part of the series

#####

love this game bought it 8 days ago and have 46 hours logged made it to level 46 i think so an hour a level roughly 

i didnt play the previous titles in the anno series so the popular complaint that this is too similar to their previous titles didnt apply to me 

im a huge city builder sc series cities skylines and base builder supreme commander act of war cnc series fan i dont play too many different games and i dont think ive ever reviewed a game love this game said that already sorry its the best of both worlds to me  without the associated headaches of each

compared to sim city  everything here works lol you make an adjustment to a trade route you pop back in your sector and its there and its correct d

compared to cities skylines  you dont have to give a crap about traffic relatively speaking  everything with a radius effect still needs an efficient route to those facilities same little road goes everywhere and i guess due to traffic that uses the sky above the roads traffic isnt a problem so much less headache love it

ive only played on easy so far but the game is very forgiving and not real finicky granted you have to keep your act together in many respects i just never felt pressure to hurry to any annoying extent its more enjoyable than stressful but yes you do have to do certain things i guess i just find it easy to keep up on easy 

for the hours ive already had and all im going to get just to get through the game once  25 for the whole lot was a great deal at 46 hours ive completed about 40200 achievements  so plenty to go ive unlocked all but one sector  but theres a ton of work left to do on almost all of them

im scheming on plans for the next game on a higher difficulty there are things you are going to learn as you go so i recommend starting on easy so you can learn those things like which sectors are best for which commodity and how to lay out a population in the most efficient way

no complaints no regrets no crashes no lost saves 

my so is downloading herself a copy as we speak

my only compliant  and its waaay down in the noise  you have to be careful when moving a building the game will be more than happy to let you drop it somewhere where not all of the buildings modules will fit  and those modules get deleted without warning





#####

probably a great game but ubisoft uplay would not let me

#####

i was initially disappointed by anno 2205 feeling it to be a flawed successor to anno 2070 and in many ways a worse game overall 

so what did i not like about 2205

 special resource requirements for expanding production facilities requiring you to
 participate in conflict zones to farm them which breaks up the flow of the game
 no procedurally generated maps hugely reduces replayability and even overall enjoyment of the game
 no ability to directly manage your stock taking crates of goods putting them on your ship sending your ship to another island its all abstracted into surplus or deficit now
 performance issues though that was partly on me for having outdated graphics card i still feel the game should have been optimized more
 it was too expensive

so i left a negative but crude review and moved on not planning to pick it up and play it again until i did but i am glad i did because it turns out this game is a lot more playable than i gave it credit for initially so what made my experience so different this time

i have grudgingly come to accept some of the aspects of this game that i dont like special resources conflict zones stock abstraction the game might have been patchedbalanced to give me a more favorable impression and going into it i was prepared to play around the things i didnt like i also remain hopeful that procedurally generated maps will be added at some point it would make a world of a difference

so yes i do recommend this game is it worth the price ultimately for me it was even though i personally think they priced the game too high

#####

this game is amazing it makes me think about our glorious future as humanity and also it makes me wish to become scientist and move forward our progress together with others i definitely recommend this game because if it inspires you to do something great then its definetly worth playing

#####

i was a huge anno fan i loved anno 2070 and it is the most played game in my library i do enjoy anno 2205 but i was greatly disappointed when i came to find that there is no differentiation between mission play and freeplay i want to be able to play the missions and do the story but i also want to be able to just make a city in a freeplay similar to how the previous anno games allowed

#####

do not buy this game  july 14th update

i contacted ubisoft they are no longer able to fix corrupted saves they simply said try again

i played this game again for 14 hours got really far this time actually but early on in the game i noticed i had a problem a part of land became unusable it was a critical bug in the game 

the game code wasnt read properly and 35 levels later my computer red screened first time ive ever seen that happen i booted the game back up today and all my data is gone since that bug first popped up so my whole save file essentially was erased  

these are two separate game breaking errors ive had happen on the course of 2 different play throughs youre welcome to give the game a shot i just wish i had my money back as its unplayable

bugs aside you also experience quite a bit of memory leaks in the game as well that was the loading problems i was having before and i think thats part of why these bugs occur

simply unstable code do not buy ubisoft has dropped support for this game for any actual problems if you have a user error like how to click this menu they will help but any actual problems there is no support for it 

review  july 10th underneath

i cant i say i could possibly recommend this game when it still has game bricking bugs since initial release i would have skipped this title had i known this and became invested in it

albeit my time played stating 31 hours cause i leave games running in the background ive played about 810 straight hours the game is really fun regarding its focus on city building id probably still be playing it had my save file not essentially corrupted

to claim new areas on a map you require a vessel which commonly will glitch completely out of your game rendering it unplayable i just lost those 810 hours of gameplay why would i ever wish to invest my time in a new save file when there is potential of this bug recurring

now not only is there this game breaking bug but there are also other bugs which are irritating such as when you click a building it will often click the wrong one or sometimes the game will become really bogged down for whatever reasons and will take up 40 mins to unload and load into a new sector map now factor that into my 810 hours of gameplay and most of my time was sitting at a loading screen 

of course i dont have that issue any longer now i cant play but regardless of that i purchased this and 22 other games during the steam sale and out of those 22 games this was the one i was actually actively invested in the other games i played for 10 mins or so and didnt enjoy it but anyways 

i didnt mind the fact when you are adding modules it locks you to a single building or the fact when you highlight buildings you couldnt see a general performance insight into them or even having a data screen of each buildings performance in a centralized place or when reconfiguring factories and other buildings there was no temporary configuration function you were forced to delete part of the factory just to move another piece there wasnt a dialogue box simply to confirm or cancel a set configuration obviously this is a tad annoying or even the fact you can place multiple buildings and even move factories with multiple components yet you cant move multiple individual buildings and part of the drawback here as well was that you had to often delete buildings just to place the same building again having an inventory or even temporary plane of existence that populates on screen would rectify this move them into there and do what you need and again confirm or not the configuration most of these games dont have inventories if were being honest but with such confined spaces such as what you experience with a game like this the ability to confirm configurations for both moving individual buildings or factory components would have really made the whole gameplay experience a lot smoother 

edit also the ability to fund buildings isnt there so sometimes building an extra place for logistics is way more then you need 

so its a gamble to buy this game you might get lucky not have an issue but imo as i opened up with i would not have taken the risk had i know such a bug existed

#####

i dont recommend this game for now even though they added a few improvements such as buildings now movable you can easily see how much goods are produced  consumed there is more contrast in graphics which make buildings more identifiable than they were in anno 2070 it was a bit foggy

but the game is very shallow right now there is litteraly nothing to do after 15hours its very disappointing in comparison to former anno games it might be a good game in the future with dlcs  but right now its not

tldr  dont buy now maybe in a year or two


#####

if you are looking for an anno experience buy a previous title i would recommend 1404 or 1503

for the people looking for a new city builder to play

pros
 looking good
 bideab of colonizing the moon
 i like trains train station xd

cons
considering most points outlining the cons about the game have already been said i wont put much effort in them just look to other reviews 

it would not be fair to rate this game from my anno fan point of view so ill try not to if you are looking for a city builder i could suggest this game to you it looks beautiful and it can be fun at some points
it does however not have a lot of replayability after you have completed the campaign which is basically the game now and the price is very high too high if youd ask me compared to city skylines

my rating for this game as for people who are looking for a city builder would be a 610 give it a try if its on sale but bdontb buy it for a ridiculously high price
my rating for this game as an anno fan would be a 410 worst in the anno series by far

i dont mind if the devs want to make some changes to the game so it doesnt stay the same but these changes are not what i am looking for in an anno game to conclude i dont like bthisb is anno thus a negative rating

due to all the mixed reviews and removal of things like multiplayer changes in gameplayand so on i was unsure if i would enjoy annoy 2205 as much as i thought i would turns out after installing it i blasted through till morning and yeah it was good

one of the major complaints i see is that 2205 is dumbed down i disagree while at first it might seem simpler its not a lot of people say that the change in surplusshortage is a change from previous cames but i also diasgree there you were always producing a set amount over time consuming a set amount over time with other buildings needing a set amount over time to sustain your populations satisfaction the only change here is you get to atually see the production numbers you dont have to go to the wiki to figure out what you will produce x units of whatever over y minutes

the game starts to become fairly complex fairly quickly if youre growing your company once you get transfer routes youre going to need to start shipping biome specific items to other biomes in order to continue growing to support that youre going to need a healthy population requring more shipping lanesand so on finding a balance to grow your population steadily without endagering your bottom line is the main component of this game and im happy to say that it delivers a challenge

if you want anno 2070 part 2 this is not the game for you 2205 took some risks in changing up the formula and i think it maintains itself as a very good managementsimulation game sure there might not be multiplayer but if i want multiplayer anno i can go play 2070 or 1404 this is not the game i play for that this is the game i play for a streamlined management experience

#####

its much different than your other anno games but its okay in its own right much more casualized which many appeal to some i am not a fan of the module system as everytime you initally place something you have to be ready to leave room for the modules its a mild complaint though since you can move items around for free biggest complaint is the changes to combat although it was definitely not a strong suit of the other games they made it even worse in 2205 you go into designated battle maps which are the exact same everytime and just spam special abilities over and over you dont even get to build your fleet they just give you ships that are upgradable with no visual change when upgraded also for some reason they still give you a command ship although the only time you use it is in the stale sidequests ie pick up the drone and drive it over here definitely bring back the ability to have your own fleet that you can build all in all i would say this is the transition game into what will be a better game next time if they could combine the good aspects of the older games with some stuff from the new one i think we might have a great game on our hands next time

#####

huge shortcomings from anno 2070 local combat  removed competative nature  removed environmental challenges  removed go back to the drawing board ubisoft do not recommend

save youself time and money buy anno 2070 if youre craving this gametype

#####

i have no idea why everyone hates on this game its the best anno game by far 
fiddling with hundreds of trade routes fiddling with fire stations placements all day long the same boring settings over and overthats what i found in other anno games  endless tedium this anno is way more relaxing satisfying and throws away all the tedium of the other games

#####

bought the game expecting anno 2070 in space instead i got anno 2070 baby edition in space the game is much too simplified in regards to the previous game

#####

the game doesnt offer a ton of replay value once youre into end game it gets very dull very quickly worth it if its on sale but not full price

#####

pros
 lite city builder in a futuristic setting
 also a 4x where you need to build multiple cities on different maps simultaneously and manage trade routes between them
 visuals and music are topnotch

cons
 need to install uplay
 in some european countries is language locked so you cant play in english
 no multiplayer
 almost to none interaction with other corporations on the same map like in older annos you could build a city on the same island as competitor
 no ecological balance from anno 2070 why tho it would fit perfectly there is no such thing as pollution you can literally build farms next to factories with no penalty

anno 2205 is a unique experience unlike other entries in the series but its honestly not that bad

#####

i never picked this up because of mixed reviews but im glad i did its my favourite anno you are a global corporation with a goal to build a fusion reactor on the moon to power earth you create settlements in temperate arctic and lunar zones each with their own layout and logistical challenges each zone needs to trade products with other zones two huge improvements  i love that the game tells you how much a building consumes and produces exactly so i dont have to keep googling production charts and you can now move buildings which is a huge quality of life improvement

badditionalb
two drawbacks worth mentioning in this iteration combat now only happens in a separate zone in single missions where you get given all the ships  its trivially easy and its only purpose it to get rare resources which you can buy anyway the other main negative ive seen people discussing is that there are no random maps there are a dozen or so temperate zones to choose from 3 arctic and 3 lunar zones so in theory replayability is low once youve completed all of the challenges in those zones that being said it took me 20 hours to finish my settlements  one in each zone type so the amount of gameplay in different zones is plentiful and it also means that the zones are handcrafted and a lot more detailed

bcompleted the main objectives in 20 hoursb

#####

i apologize for my english as i am not a native speaker 

i wish there is a neutral option on steam

i choose to recommand this game because it is a pretty decent city building simulation but personally i dont consider it as a decent anno game

as the sequel of anno 2070 the game is definitely advanced in graphics but graphics is probably the only thing that 2205 is advanced compared to 2070 the core mechanisms of anno series are still avaliable in 2205 but some interesting systems eg ecobalance trading in one map with ships underwater plateau etc are taken away by the developers for some reasons  in 2205 maps are devided into 3 sections you have to wait 10s for the map to load if you want to switch to another section battles are isolated into serveral dungons instead of happening  in the same map where your cities are built these really makes the game fragmented 

in the game of anno 2205 you can find some connections between the current game and the previous anno 2070 eg the sunken ark im guessing that is virago in 2070 bankrupt global trust etc the devs also wrote some lore to connect 2205 with 2070 but overall the connection is really weak this is not a big problem though 

when i first saw the trailer of anno 2205 i was expecting sth new and interesting like space ark or battle on moon but reality is the devs cancel the entire ark system i really like the ark maybe its just me and no the battles still happen on earth

if you are interested in a scifi city building game you could consider buying anno 2205 when it is on sale since the game does offer some cool concepts however if you would like to experience the playstyle of a true anno game buy 2070 instead

#####

ive tried citybuilders in the past and the genre has never really done it for me i dont have a lot of experience with them so i have not played the previous anno games

nevertheless i picked this up because i actually found myself in the mood for a relaxing citybuilder recently and i was attracted to the graphics and the namerecognition of a series i know is beloved to many people  i saw the mixed reviews and it seemed like many of the bad reviews were from people who had played the previous anno games and had a certain set of expectations that i do not have  nothing of what i read struck me as a negative for a newbie to the series and genre so i gave it a shot

i was not disappointed  its a little intimidating at first having so much choice so much gameplay variety and not really knowing how the various game systems work i had to unlearn some preconceptions based on other citybuilders i played a long time ago but i did the very oldfashioned thing and actually read the manual and wouldnt you know it many of my questions were answered funny how manuals work  dont worry its not a long manual  you can start it and finish it during the course of a single toiletsit

there is an air of lite to this game under all the lush graphics and animations but frankly thats one of the reasons i like it as much as i do  theres a decent amount of variety to the gameplay but none of it is hardcore deep so i understand where the accusations of shallow are coming from but balancing an economy is stressful enough i dont need it to be any more convoluted and i dont need any more interruptions than this game already provides i may not be a hardcore citybuilder but i am a relatively hardcore gamer and i do not feel like this game is too easy  its pretty close to just right for me  and you can really dial up the difficulty further than i have if you like a lot of challenge

for a game that simulates economies there is one huge headscratcher where im just having to suspend my disbelief in order to enjoy it you increase your revenue by increasing your number of employees  yes people if youre running low on money in this game you rectify it simply by hiring more employees and building their houses for them  huh  wha  thats like the opposite of how a company increases its revenue  maybe the implication is that your company has a product heavily in demand and doesnt have enough employees to meet it so as you employ more people that demand is met and thus more revenue but im being very generous with that explanation  yours is a brandnew company founded solely for the purpose of establishing industry on the moon you dont have any product heavily in demand yet but whatever frankly i find it refreshing to play a management game that isnt primarily about grinding money

its fun deep enough to give you a sense of accomplishment but not so deep as to bog you down and it has a ton of polish

#####

im actually surprised that im enjoying this game as much as i am its not overly complicated like most city builders are nowadays the combat was unexpected yet welcomed very clean ui and gameplay overall pretty fun

#####

apparently eastern europe is restricted to russian language only because muh piracy this is extremely disrespectful and outright insulting move by publishers

#####

i miss being able to play this game owned it through uplay but lost that account couldnt get it back bought it through steam attempted to make new uplay account said it was my old account cant get support would gladly buy this game again if i could but oh well 
this was easily the best anno they ever made 
i would recommend it entirely if not for the fact that ubisoft as a company and their customer service is absolute garbage

#####

now that the last part of the season pack has fallen we can see the whole picture  and its very pretty as a game it is weak and shallow but very pretty the dlc have added breadth but no further depth more minigame like features but nothing that adds to the strategy building and trading depth

fun for a few hours of play shallow gameplay without much challenge or interesting stories to tell

#####

1404 was good
2075 didnt play too much
2205 best anno game for me  transport system is super easy and clean no big hassle with figuring out whats wrong with a trade route or anything just enjoy
1800 is 1404 with fancy graphics

#####

didnt use to but now requires some stupid ubisoft login of course it doesnt support password managers screw this i have better things to do than deal with another weirdo company pushing their useless login service id rather not play this game and not buy any future ubisoft games than deal with annoying crap like this in the little time i wanted to spend playing a video game

#####

an unquestionably pretty game but a game that doesnt quite know what it wants to be  city builder or rts its so confused that it effectively has those two modes working entirely independant of each other

the city building ranges from incredibly mundane through to outright frustrating i dont know why the developers thought it a good idea to make you build a city to gain population and then require you to build incredibly large buildings near that population when its at a size that you no longer have any space to actually fit them most of the city building is like playing tetris in 3d as you try to fit combinations of building blocks together in some coherent fashion the management of several location is not so much an intended game mechanic as it is a work around for technical limitations having to jump between several regions  and wait for loading for each one  especially later in the game was tedious and annoying it may have worked better if no loading was required

the rts portion which in previous versions of anno were part of the core gameplay is now almost entirely optional you can choose if you want to go on a mission or just grow your population to level your corp and skip it altogether the ability to upgrade your ships was greatbut there was no real point in doing so the missions themselves were incredibly easy with the ai not being all that bright

the minimissions or quests within the citybuilding portion of the game seem to just be tacked on with no real purpose other than to check off something on a feature list the core campaign missions aside they are not required to do and theres no real benefit to doing them at all the campaign missions comprise of go here get this take it there type of objectives more than one of them was literally completed without having to scroll across the screen  the things i had to collect were where i got the mission

anno 2205 is a clear prime example of style of substance i loved 2070 but 2205 is a real disspointment what a pity

#####

i enjoyed most of the past anno games but this one is pretty bad

summary
they have literally taken out anything that made past games fun the fun in past games came from having to keep your citizens happy while fighting off pirates or that you had to settle an expansionisland early because the competing ai would take it otherwise or that a fire broke outtornado turned uppirates found your trade ship and you had to deal with it also why in the world did they remove the ai players i just dont understand it there is absolutely no challenge in this game and that makes it really boring with 2070 they removed ai with this game they removed the rest of the challenges it is now just an economics game

pros
i like the module system of expanding your existing buildings
the new system that replaced the trade routes is all right although i would have liked things to go wrong there too

cons
this game has no challenge and you will likely play the same game every time 
   there is no random generation in islands you will be playing on the same maps every time
   if you dont feed your people there is no real problem it only decreases your income slightly
   every single game will play out nearly the same way and the game will tell you nearly exactly what you need to do next get 200 miners build blah get 1000 investors so you can build
   there are no challenges to island life i played with randomly generated events but nothing has happened
   the fighting is done in an instanced area and is also always the same you go there spend a lot of time having your ships destroy defended and defenseless buildings and then you go back to your island as if nothing had happened it has become a barrier that you need to do in order to progress and that means it is now just a burden and if you play it again you do the exact same battles

#####

umi made a bad review a while ago but upon upgrading my slow monitor i must return to my original thought that it is a decent game turns out i was in for an upgrade

#####

if you really enjoy pure sandbox games  like me  this game may suits you 

warning   this game eats alot of ram is like it has a memory leak or something 

#####

i was really scared to buy this game knowing it changed so much but i was pleasantly surprised devs removed all that boring and repetitive stuff that made my head ache billions of trading routes boat space management area base satisfaction buildings  now they are road based  and made me focus on more important fun stuff resources are infinite which is nice by allowing you to simultaneously manage different regions gameplay implements sort of macro economy which is unique and most certainly fun feature the combat is much better and actually entertaining 

would recommend on sale with all dlcs

update started a new run the replayability is not good everything is pretty much the same i am the guy that likes to tinker and make things the most efficient way possible so that is why i would like to do another playthrough i see how people can be upset with this 

again awesome game but would recommend only on sale with all dlcs

#####

anno 2205 is a difficult one to give a definitive yesno to on the one hand its more beautiful fluid and simple in a good way compared to earlier titles on the other its just lacking a lot of things that didnt need to be taken out of the series so essentially its also simple in a bad way

got a bunch of spare resources hanging around that you want to sell if you only have the smallsized transport for taking goods to the global trade market youre gunna make a loss every time you try to sell anything because of transport maintenance costs you cant sell directly to other corporations either nor can you sell to merchants who are sitting in your region trying to get you to buy their own goods i would suppose that trade gets easier later on but by then youd probably be bored of the game anyways

after a while the gameplay gets boring and repetative too the combat missions are fun at first but get repetative and uninteresting whilst they do add an extra layer to the game and the later missions become optional theres not enough thats special about them to make them worth all the features that have been taken out

and do you want to play multiplayer sandboxskirmish mode special scenarios tough the only thing present in the game so far is the campaign whilst some may argue that the campaign contains an element of sandbox there are still quests that you are forced to do to progress and there are no randomlygenerated maps so each time you restart youre given the same selection of regions

the devs evidently decided to change up the series with this one and whilst they had some interesting ideas they were simply poorly integrated would i recommend it in its current state no but if the devs are smart theyll realise that there are things that need adding and hopefully add them in the future even if it has to be via payed dlc perhaps one day this game will become worth its price or have decreased in price enough to be worth its quality

#####

i longed for this game for 2 years and i have to say i have a bit of mixed feelings about it its visually awesome really awesome and the different environments are cool the stock market addition makes it more challenging and fun but the overall impression is of a overwhelming sense of futuristic cold and emptyness mankind has achieved so much but its ruled but 5 now 6 gigantic corporations all those wonderful factories work like a swiss watch but all those people have such simplified yet futuristic needs combat is quite meh just a few missions all pretty similar and after some time you just do them again for graphene the worst part is actually the minitasks assigned by the other corporations leaders so easy and trivial that look like a chore i dont regret buying it for 1299 euros but the replay value after the first playthrough is zero and the only challenge in your sector are resources pick it here and send it there nice game but a wasted opportunity in my opinion

#####

got the game while it was on sale and its not horrible however ubisofts business practices are disgusting their requirement to have their own launcher and the comments made by their ceo about how they dont believe their customers own what we pay for are horrendous and i would advise never buying anything from this brand ever again

#####

not for the udiehardu anno enthusiast but for the rest of us

this is a really decent game  like most developers at one point or another whether its because of a new developerdirectorcreative genius whom lives off of spring water from europe and bukowski novels that comes on board or because the executives get caught up in the we gotta be new and cutting edge hysteria ubisoft decided they needed to shake up the mechanics a bit for the anno series  however from my own experience with the hours ive put into it thus far its actually not a terrible thing

its cut out the micromanagement a bit allowing you to focus wholly on the broader spectrum of developing your resources and shipping routes which theres another whole tidbit well get into  the micromanagement actually was one hell of a challenge in the past couple anno games like 2070 or dawn of discovery or 1404 for the brits started out pretty straight forward but put a few dozen hours into and bblamob youre somehow short an essential resource and a couple of your mines have run dry but you spent all your money on frivolous decorations while the enemy starts its massive campaign against your islands  anno 2205 is a little more forgiving ok a lot more forgiving

additionally one new concept that the other series never had is linking maps together  you know what always sucked  building a whole town up during missions only to have to restart a whole nother one afterwards and never really reaping the rewards or resources or money  for whatever reason you build a sprawling empire with copious resources and monies and a massive armada only to go to a new mapnext mission and for whatever reason you never could bring any of it along with  this game skirts that a bit as you really are on just one mission that continues to evolve as you go  oh and those massive towns you build on each island  well you get to share all the monies iandi create routes between completely different maps to share resources  i dont care if you are a diehard anno fan that hates this game you gotta admit that was a novel addition

and you get to build on the moon

wait i dont think you quite grasp the concept here you get to build on the god damn bmoonb

maybe im behind in playing a variety of simmanagementrts games but ive never gotten to play a game where you get to play on earthterran planet while also building space colonies on more hazardous planets  its always been one or the other not both  plus i enjoy how every map has their own challenges like perhaps a damn which needs to be repaired  through a slew of various missions or gas which needs to be encapsulated providing various pros and cons for each area

in short  did they dumb down a lot of mechanics  yes  did they add some new features to make up for it  yes  again this may not be for the udiehardu enthusiast however if youre a pretty laid back and open minded gamer or youre new to the anno series this isnt a bad game at all  id say this puppy is easily worth 30 bucks maybe 40 if youre getting it with all the dlc maybe  this a great time killer for a lazy sunday afternoon

graphics  8510
sound  810
controls 710
storyline  7510
replayability  7510
im pretty generous with these usually so they might be a little lower if youre harder at critiquing

#####

im honestly disappointed by this game there is no trading system like in 2070 and theres no dedicated campaign but more like a huge tutorial i feel like im being rushed into starting new sections when i want to expand in my current island i didnt buy the season pass with the sole hope that i would like it before i bought but im happy i didnt because 6000 is a waste of money on a game that was so hyped and gave us all huge expectations but now is just a huge let down i hope ubisoft bring in more features such as new factions to play with or this wait would have been for nothing

#####

having played anno 2070 i was a huge fan of the series but held on purchase due to all the negative reviews

was on sale and saw better reviews after the additions of dlcs and decided to purchase

this game is probly one of the best games of this genre ive played and is very very highly recommended ive clocked 43 hours in 3 days addictive

ive played games from simcity 1  5 tropico 1  5 civ 1  5 etc and i would rate this one of the highest amongst them

sure alot of anno fans gave negative reviews on this as they felt it was not an anno game because the developers had redesigned the gameplay in certain ways

this is a great introduction to the anno series the gameplay is more straight foward in comparison to anno 2070 more simplified trade route system and does not punish you as hard as anno 2070 in terms of building it has more flexibility to a large degree not as punishing as anno 2070

the combat is more mission based type that can be replayed to get resources and upgrades

as always the attention to detail for all the buildings the enviroment is better than other compeitors the game is absolutely beautiful

this does not have a sandbox mode however i completed the main campaign in about 35 hours of play time and even more with the dlcs

strongly recommend to purchase this game with all the dlcs included as they add maps like tundra which has more production items orbitual space station which boosts production etc

the developer really put in such a great effort into this its quite discouraging they recieved so many negative reviews at the start and never really gave it a chance

buy this game full price or on sale you wont regret it



#####

personally i am a big fan of the anno games i have hundreds of hours on 2070

2205 is a very different beast it is on a much bigger scale the graphics are beautiful the music is soothing and the general city building and logistics are very well executed

the only down side i can find is the combat strategical engagements take place away form the citys and is more of a puzzle than a fight it is no real challenge at all

that being said despite of this the game is excellent they have concentrated on what makes anno a brilliant economic strategy game and have added new mechanics such as a decent stock market and more environmental challenges based on the sector you are in

810


#####

uplay is a downright pain in the butt  either their service is down or the launcher gives errors galore  
im sure the game is great but i cant get past the terrible uplay barrier and after many troubleshooting steps about 2hrsish i just gave up and requested a refund

#####

i feel like i am on autopilot with this gameno strategy or planning just keep building and meeting demand

and the combat stuff is slow and awful

#####

dont buy this game
they are putting it on sale even though they are decommissioning the online services aka no multiplayer and online features
httpswwwubisoftdotcomengbhelpgameplayarticledecommissioningofonlineservicesseptember2022000102396

#####

it ok  but little no replay value that what anno is known for is being replayable which makes it so sad

#####

why did i buy a damn ubisoft game why
got the game yesterday on sale
launched through steam
opens bloody uplay
fails to log on cant even play in offline mode
fml f u ubisoft

#####

yesterday i bought 3 games of the 4 in the series all 3 worked perfectly after install
today only 2 working and this one crashing during warningloading screen
not what i paid for

i will not ever be purchasing the 4th game nor any further ubisoft products the stupidity of requiring another launcher beyond steam is mind boggling had i bought the game from ubisoft then fair enough but i didnt so ubisofts dubious and erratic launcher should not be a requirement if game is sold through a 3rd party site that already has to be up and running to play the game

it is already hit or miss if i can even play most of the games i have already purchased from ubisoft both direct and steam purchases the constant hoopjumping with their launcher upon starting each and every time is a headache would ubisoft staff accept going to a restaurant and paying for a meal they may or may not get that is exactly how i feel as a ubisoft customer no more

#####

read other negative reviews  this game is even worse that anno online
theyve decided to simplify it making more like simcity but totally failed on every aspect besides graphics


#####

well not an easy task to review this one as it is a special kind of game

if i had to compare it to other city builders such as cities xl or cities skylines i couldnt really do it as it is clearly a poorer version of those with incredibly basic features pretty much a drug rehab methadone filled accessible city builder 
but some will point out that its not a city builder by nature and as such shouldnt have the ambition to compete in that market
fair enough

if i had to rate it on its military section which is unavoidable since its basically our only source of special materials id piss on it and have more quality fun by throwing it on flying birds and trying to make lunch out of it
but again some will point out that it isnt a str and shouldnt be judged with the same criterias you use for one even though i havent found a game with such a horrible gameplay and units micromanagement since the 90s
okay
if i had to rate it for its multiplcant finish that word without laughing so hard id choke on my creatine

so there we are i guess you get my point this is some kind of jack of nope master of none definitely


ill try to explain a bit better

you start on an island that you have previously chosen with a temperate climate with 4 levels of difficulty
your goal is to build a maximum of habitations and level them up according to population needs which are different for each level

to that end youll need a local production that will provide what the first levels needs 
then to provide for the next ones youll have to produce somewhere else and this is where anno 2205 differs from the previous ones

as a matter of fact youll have to choose and open an artic zone to produce some goods and then a lunar one  to produce the other goods and services such as energy which will be your bread and butter during the whole experience
to connect these maps you have to upgrade each spaceport and trade those goods and services through traderoutes which will cost income depending on quantity and location


a main quest will guide you through these points helping you understand how it all works but you shouldnt worry as it is really really 5years old accessible
also secondary quests will give you a bonus which nature will depend on the locations you choose whether it is temperate artic or lunar thats actually the reason why you get to choose the zonesa bonus in energy in special materials or even ornamentals
then if you havent gone for the highest difficulty tertiary quests which quality i wont comment will pop up in your zone helping you get more special materials in addition to those you get in the conflict zones military ones


special materials are essential to the game as they give you the possibility to upgrade production buildings in order to save space and thats anno 2205 in a nutshell as space management will be your only challenge and the engine powering everyone of your decisions in the game
as i said before and especially in the highest level of difficulty as you dont have tertiary quests these materials will be earned in repeating the same two conflict zones over and over with warships
ill behave and just give you a hint about the level of crappiness the conflict zones feature  rightclick is used both to move your units and move the map like mid mouse button in other games you cant disable that well done ubibi

all of this basically the main quest will take you maybe 1015 hours depending on your familiarity with the soft
then your ultimate goal will be to reach the highest possbile population by opening the other maps and doing the same stuff you did in the previous onesagain and again this is actually the new version of anno sandbox

so whats your goal in this so called by them definitely not me sandbox 

is it the most money  to have an impact on other players in the infamously absent multiplayer they initially bragged about 
nope as your money is capped and your income will be useless 90 of the time 100 once you unlocked the few zones in the game
also what they call multiplayer is actually an ai led market which number of traderoutes is also capped at 10 featuring the most basic offer and demand system without any human interactions whatsoever

so your ultimate goal is actuallythe most population your corporation level will raise itself depending on your population and so will the money and traderoutes cap altho the traderoutes with marketplace wont go higher than 10
to that end you get now why the only challenge of this game apart from 95 of clamhead accessible problems is space management
the zones are limited in space and number have fun with that

im corp level 139 platinum prefrontiers dlc which is actually insanely high and i had to do cheesy stuff and ubisoft stupidity abuse to get there  where i got definitely fed up and quit i could have kept destroying and rebuilding everything but nope
my money cap is 13m my income is 550k since level 80

the freelc were welcome but didnt add anything relevant to the game



in conclusion this anno in good conformity with all ubisoft licences assassins creed anno heroes of might and magic and rainbow six for the past 7 years is pretty much the same stuff weve seen for the last 10 years all over again with the exception of a couple of details and obviously the same stupidly high price for a mediocre quality low creativity low challenge low work input game

ubisoft in a nutshell average

510 

value for money  310 considering the number of dlcs that added crap for an unacceptable price and the fact that many dlcs including frontier the last one are not included in the season pass which is kinda the definition of stealing

#####

the series has deteriorated since the ip was taken over by ubisoft and the founding studio was shut down despite being a superfan of the sunflower anno games and of scifi and space settings i was let down badly by 2205 this is an amazing series fallen to its lowest point instead of buying this try anno 1404 dawn of discovery or for a more modern setting anno 2070

#####

id definitely call this a missed opportunity let me explain why

 the graphics are really really good although the cutscenes have some serious framerate issues using an r9290 on an i74790k both overclocked
 the campaign is nice although much much too short it shouldve been at least three times as long
 the overall difficutly is perhaps not as high compared to anno 1404 or anno 2070 but its more streamlined thus kindof ok
 having several simultaneous locations in development is amazing yet having to wait for the game to load them every time you jump from one to another is crap
 the resources you have to produce are quite innovative and immersive yet you cannot escape the feeling that the sole purpose of this game is to produce moar moar moar regardless of which resource it is

overall id rate this a 710
i played both anno 1404 and anno 2070 and this is not better nor is it worse than the other two

#####

the older annos were much better than this diaster perhaps it was a good idea and maybe it does have great graphics but it reminds me of a mobile game requesting me to buy dlc to make my logo prettier every start throws a million ads into my face sorry but the older annos were extremly better and far more creative good idea though uplay is also a massive pain to use

#####

do not buy anymore the world market trade routes have just stopped working and it seems ubisoft does not care about it anymore

#####

by far my favourite anno and city building game
 good entry point for interested players in this genre
 great variety with dlc super cheap and included in ultimate edition with each land type mediterranian arctic swamps moon surface space station each having different buildings and mechanics for city building such as space station builds like a ribs on a spine arctic living buildings need to be close to heat generating industrial buildings otherwise homes are cold moon settlements require shielding from small meteorite fragments which need a lot energy swamplands need to go be made habitable little by little and all of these lands run their cities and economies on different maps at the same time each having a dozen unique resources that people and industries on other land types need and youll need to create a complex logistics and production network so that each land supports the others but also has enough for its own and every building is unique its not like ok this is a mine  a stone icon on top its unreasonably stunningly detailed and creative feeling real
 the scifi theme is very grounded and feels real offering the best visual variety across the franchise with stunning maschinery
   user friendly but maybe not hardcore enough for some pathing does not matter if you produce x amount of something that goes into your storage instantly regardless of how difficult it is to reach the factory by trucks traffic is for show only on one hand this might be off putting for more hardcore city builders on another its very welcoming for beginners and logistics comes from intercontinental interplanetary logistics between maps really
    once you finish it by constructing the nigh infinite energy building which is the goal of the campaign story there is not much left to it you can start over but it always feels the same little replayability in this sense but i find myself reinstalling this game about once a year and playing it again from 0 instead of throwing cash out on a newer entry because its damn good enough that i dont feel it becoming outdated technically or overshadowed by a better entry its gold

#####

keeps asking me to buy dlcs i know ubisofts management lacks the creativity to grow sales but this is a bit too much i paid for the product i dont want to see ads to even more of your products

#####

its a love and hate relationship with this game

pros 
beautiful graphics
buildings  roads cars and decorations are very well detailed
easy walk through 
plenty of action
very futuristic feel which matches the title of the game
interesting concept

cons
adam is annoying
sam is annoying
game lags quite often and when restarting the game it leaves you back to the last thing you did eg if you were on a level 11 then the game sets you back to a level 9 or 10
people are always needy
lose power and logistics easily
can lose work force very easily


however i would recommend this game as it is very beautiful to look at and the game has a very nice and calm atmosphere which is good if you are a sort of person who likes a nice and calm game while also providing some challenges

#####

my brain exploded when i got to the moon all anno games are good

#####

what a complete dissapointment
i want my money back

i was so incredibly happy when i noticed there was a new anno game without hesitation i bought it launched it and well buhbey 120 aussie dollars

what a complete waist of money and what a complete disgrace to the anno franchise

i honestly have no idea what ubisoftblue byte were smoking on the day they decided to make this game so incredibly dull and easy yes even on the hardest difficulty that a baby would be able to finish this game

and for me as a diehard anno fan this is not anno this is something completely different something i would never have bothered with if only i knew they were gonna mess up so bad

for all anno franchise fans
 no more islands
 no more logistics
 no more fine tuning production buildings
 no more trading
 no more ai
 no more relatives of leif and thilda jorgensen 
 no more continuousskirmish games
 no more protecting your harbers from hector
 no more multiplayer absolutely none

tldr no more anno 

never played anno before please buy anno 1404 or anno 2070 they are a million times better



#####

big fan of anno 1800  have at least 1000 hours on that version of the game and finally wanted to try something new different  well this is  it has a lot of similarities supply chains shipments etc  but also has enough newdifferent things to make it fun again

#####

so im going to start this review just by saying i firmly believe if the creators launched a game with these mechanics under a different name and a different theme they would have received much more positive feedback 

this game does a lot of great things and is actually pretty fun to play that said its not what i expected from an anno game anno has traditionally been a game thats heavily based on trade within the map youre playing on in this game you trade between maps akin to sim city 4 but with far better control and much more intuitive interface it is very unfair to compare the game itself to sim city 4 however as this game has nowhere near the number of gameplay issues that one did that all being said i have very much enjoyed my time playing the game withstanding a few minor annoyances

pros
large maps ability to jump between regional maps makes production chains a breeze
great graphics
intuitive building system does not punish you and allows movement of buildings later in the game
easy production chain monitoring
awesome soundtrack
temperate cities are awesome and fun to build

cons
no multiplayer
battle maps are stupid it feels like a minigame i want to defend my trade routes i dont want to play a battle on a random map
logistic system
nontemperate cities are literally just for the production chains and lack any depth in terms of building

im going to just comment on the logistic system quick as i think this is the major issue i have with the game in all the previous anno games you had a warehouse you needed to set up trade routes and you were always monitoring how many supplies were in your warehouses on each of your islands that is completely gone from this game yes you can trade between maps but to be honest youre just balancing the number of goods flowing into the areas and if youre like me you have no idea how many actual supplies are anywhere at any given point  which sucks because that was what was fun in the old games

now although this isnt exactly what i was expecting from an anno game since i wanted something where i was establishing trade routes playing with friends defending trade routes and colonizing islands notice how many times i focused on trade there  i wont say i regret my purchase theyve made a decent game here and i did enjoy my play time  in fact ill probably continue to play it the lack of multiplayer the uninteresting citybuilding in nontemperate regions and the changes to the trade aspect of the game are definitely a bummer but perhaps there is hope these will be addedfixed in the dlc  though its also sad i have to say that if youre looking for a game thats fun to play has a decent storyline and has some new ways of tackling citybuilding i would recommend this game if youre looking for an anno experience go with one of the older ones until this goes on sale 


#####

cant launch the game ubisoft connect tells me it cant authenticate my purchase pathetic worthless service

#####

this game was ok for a time but they made their dlc and stopped completely no new updates no multiplayer and i am stuck with the same maps over and over againimmesion is non existant and basically they are doing what all aaa devs do which is pump out half finished games as quick as possible with no regard to the player experience

#####

lets play for a quick 30 minutes watch clock hoyl f ive been playing for 5 hours kinda game

#####

good game but ubisoft is trash

#####

i had this game in library for some time but wasnt sure i wanted to dive in because of all those negative reviews how foolish i was game is great

pros
 its still anno with all the management planning and building
 instead of different islands you control different sectors which makes it feel a bit more like building a proper empire
 fresh new look
 battles are optional
 working your way up to the biggest corporation is fun

cons
 battle missions are sooooo boooooring
 side tasks are all the same
 research and space station are a bit confusing
 no sandbox
 saving doesnt exist so there is no way to reload if you fuck up

i can recommend this game as it sure is quite good but i can only hope the next one is going to learn from the mistakes and wont have the same dumb problems missing sandbox and being unable to reload that is just stupid decision for this kind of game

#####

 danger                danger                 danger 

ubisoft is threatening to delete the uplay accounts and all the associated games of anyone who fails to sign into uplay often enough this is unacceptable behaviour

ubisoft already had threadbare relations with me after pulling support for my favourite old strategy gem anno 2070 and anno 2205 barely worked for me as well this the nail in the coffin i have marked the entire publisher as ignore on steam and barring a radical change in how ubisoft conducts business i may never purchase a game from them again

 danger                danger                 danger 

#####

a lot of the freedoms and decision making has been omitted in this version many buildings including warehouses are restricted to predefined positions certain goods cannot be built but acquired only through repeated combat missions in external sectors easily completed by spamming rockets and 1clickrepairall abilities but at least the ships are upgradable by clicking 1 button fun right many buildings require a single resource and some credits to construct upgrading citizens involves planting a farm and waiting for the shiny green up arrow trade is reduced to clicking on 2 sectors then patting yourself on the back theres no items for ships no ecology no depot cart limits no opposition in your own sector theres none of the stop and consider this problem solving prevalent in the previous versions
an incredibly boring oversimplified and repeative farse an awful moneygrabbing excuse for a sequel
on the plus side its very pretty

#####

2020 revise

a fantastic game with revolution mod i found it even more enjoyable than anno 1800

#####

the dislike of this game seems to come from people who feel its been dumbed down having played anno 2070 at least i can agree that it has but disagree on it being bad the thing about the sort of difficulty that more complex infrastructure management entails is its an annoyance for those who dont like it and for those who have mastered it to the point that its basically the equivalent of adding 50 more steps to everything you want to do 2205 feels more fast paced because of the streamlining that has been done and thats a good thing

#####

will probably be deleted when ubisoft decides so starting with its dlc buy at your own risk the game was pretty good but ubisoft is not trustable i do not recommend

#####

fucking horrible dealing with uplay even if you reset your password the game still will not work its so important that they enforce security youre not allowed to play the game even if you bought it i still cant get into the game i paid for

#####

this game sat on my watchlist for a while before i got around to buying it itd be hard to convince me of a franchise that i hadnt heard of was worth the price of the game at the time i bought the game during one of the steam sales as a newcomer to the franchise im fairly impressed

ive read plenty of the reviews and it seems that much of the dislike comes from how simple it is in comparison to other games from the series i certainly understand this frustration as i wouldnt want a game in a beloved series that i play to be too easy and too simple for me but being the newcomer that i am i am pleased that i can get into the series at an easier pace youll definitely see me buying into the series as i progress more through the game 

it isnt all good one of the negative aspects for me would be the naval combat for completionists like me the combat is monotonous ive routinely ignored it as optional side missions unless it is critical to the campaign i simply forgo it base game is fun nonetheless and the trade routes add a nice plug of interconnectedness that would have otherwise made the dlc and managing other bases unenjoyable arctic region can be difficult at first dealing with heat sources that are annoyingly precise buildings are boxes heat sources are circles if so much as a centimeter is sticking out of the circle its uninhabitable 

the tutorial is fairly nonexistent this can be good or bad depending on how you play for someone who was looking to learn more i would have preferred the tutorial to be more pushy and force me to do things so i understand the concept that being said i more or less skipped it by not realizing it was there it all ended up working out but i can see where this would get in the way of new players 

all in all i recommend this for newer players of the series for older members i havent played other games in it but id say with my limited knowledge its a nice addition

#####

something is off about anno 2205 i kept forcing myself to play the game and i wasnt sure why

i like the concept of having multiple settlements that support each other upgrading buildings to increase function is also cool thats about it for positives i can think of i was  excited to see rts elements in a city builder game i thought that might be a nice compliment to the building something to break up the city building grind but that ended up being the worse part for me the combat really reminds me of a ds era rts game which isnt a compliment its just mindless the only strategy is to pick up weapons to help speed up the level and try not to pull multiple enemies 

as for the city building aspect i guess most city games have a system where you build buildings in order to unlock and build other buildings but in anno 2205 its so blatant like you cant build settlement buildings unless you have enough resources so then you build the resource building to get settlement buildings in order to add workers to build resource buildings and rinse and repeat  

definitely not worth its steep price tag theres too much up breaking up the potentially addicting city building aspect

#####

a massive step back for anno playable but in no way worth the price tag

major cutbacks

 military removed from the game there are combat missions but your cities and trade routes will never be attacked you have no shipyards ships are provided for free for combat missions and transport ships just cost upkeep no ships or vehicles present in cities except for cosmetic doodads that do nothing
 huge shift in focus youll spend a majority of your time doing missions that are as terrible as ever fast forwarding the game while your command ship the only controllable ship outside of combat does the same gather flotsamlifeboatbuttplugs missions from anno2070
 factions are island specific no option for where and when you pursue them arctic moon temperate all have seperate people and production chains but they arent interesting anymore since military is cut there are no alternate ships available and
 island variety is gone different islands there are only 3 of each type in the game buy the dlc for more have different layouts and miningfishing spots but there are no fertilities no finite resources like oregold they just keep going did i mention every map is a single island and you just swap between them to top this off all factories require population to work so having different islands serve different purposes is no longer a thing they are all cities now 
 extremely casual resource management the game looks like a proper game but oozes ios gameplay basic buildings are built like normal but they require special resources for upgrades that make them more efficient resources you can get by doing the stupid combat missions regular missions or buy at a ridiculous price instead of producing goods that go in your warehouse the games economy operates on the cities xl formula each building produces x amount of tokens and consumes y amount of other tokens theres no storage and goods arent collected by warehouses anymore 
 modulesequipmentresearch removed a major part of anno2070 was the academies producing and distributing equipment for increasing finite resources on an island or giving an island certain bonusses

ive got more complaints and no space its citiesxl now might as well get that instead since its cheaper and has curved roads

#####

pros
good quality graphics
lots of content
gameplay is good
easy to understand controls

cons
no replay value once you unlock all sectors and build the corporation hq youve literally finished the game and there are no different choices you can make therefore to replay this it would be the exact same as the save you played before
sectors feel tiny
constant requirement to micromanage everything
if balance one thing another thing goes wrong
everything is a dlc

#####

decent game but the login requirement is obnoxious  always has trouble staying logged in  to make it more annoying the site wont let me reuse the same password its a game account not my credit card  it doesnt have my credit card info or anything like that so why does it need a high level of security just let me play the damn game i bought


#####

anno only by name its a great game dont misunderstand me but it feels radically different from anno 1800 and anno 2070 it has its charm but the global map is too big and the game because a bit repetitive after you finished the main campain not much replayability compared to other issues of the series 
still look gorgeous though and for me it has the best combat scenarios among the series

#####

its really fun and im happy i purchased it but i see what all the others are saying theres not much left that is really interesting once you hit late game  ive enjoyed it for the 20 hours ive played at the time of writing but the dlc of which ive started the tundra and space missions doesnt seem to offer much in the way of switching up the gameplay loop or giving me some interesting problems to solve

good
  looks fantastic  lots of detail in all the models and character animations  neat cinematics whenever you reach a new objective  this definitely looks like a highbudget title
  really satisfying core gameplay loop throughout the campaign  the unlock a new resource build  upgrade infrastructure expand existing resources repeat cycle is a ton of fun  youre always wondering what beautiful building is right around the corner in the progression system and managing the logistics across multiple regions can be an interesting bit of management
  cool metagame buying and selling stocks in rival corporations trading between cities selling surplus goods on the stock market espionage with competitors its all pretty interesting stuff to break up the pacing
  each map has its own unique objectives  the reward for completing these objectives can be really neat and interesting but the quests that you need to do to get that reward are often pretty lame more on quests later
  hooking back in to that progression system i mentioned earlier certain campaign milestones really have a wowfactor attached to them  when you first unlock the tundra and you start to see the interconnectivity between the different zones economies you are at first a little overwhelmed but that soon turns to excitement as you realize all the possibilities  this goes right up to the end of the game with a pretty cool gamechanging unlock that i wont spoil
  the diversity of environments really keeps things fresh  each ecosystem has its own set of buildings citizens landscapes and resources  the regions all not only look different but they play differently as well  manage heat for your citizens in the tundra build shields to protect against asteroids on the moon and keep environmentals in check on your space station each one offers a slight tweak on gameplay that keeps things fresh over the duration of the campaign

bad
  once youve stopped unlocking new things to build the game kinda dies  im not sure what the difference is between this game and other city builders like cities skylines perhaps its that the actual city building isnt very interesting  youre confined to a simple grid youre not given much to do in terms of logistics there isnt much to do with optimization aside from rearranging your resource production facilities ie nothing to do with the city building aspect of the game and there arent really many interesting problems to solve to keep your citizens happy outside of giving them resources and plopping down a few service structures  you dont have something like traffic to deal with in this game so theres less player skill and creativity involved and more putting puzzle pieces in place  i think this is why the game doesnt last very long once youve reached endgame
  the little combat missions are a drag and even though this may sound inconsequential in a city builder you are kind of encouragedforced to do these a couple times and they always put a damper on the experience  i dont mine having combat units ingame but they should control better and provide some more interesting interactions with their enemies  building the army should be more interesting too  if the anno series is gonna keep these sections in i think they really need to invest more time in them
  noncombat missions are as boring as always  fetch find and transport quests  another concept that has potential but needs more design work


notes
  performance is really bad at certain angles but not all the time  if youre at _just the right_ elevation while looking at a dense part of the city framerates will drop in to the low 20s on a highend rig but if you zoom in or out a bit to kick in a different lod or some object culling youll see a big leap and things will start to look better like the rest of the game
  really wish this was coop like anno 2070  that games coop feature is what kept me coming back to it but i will sadly not be doing that here

#####

i got anno 2070 a few years ago and absolutely loved it i wracked up a lot of playtime with this beautiful looking game
i dont really play single player missions in games but this was alright in comparisson to a lot of games on the market

continuous play and multiplayer are what makes this game great the freedom to span a map with your colony to grow your mighty city into a thriving metropolis

h1oh wait this is anno 2205h1
i bought this game luckily last time it went on offer do not buy it unless its on offer if you really must buy it and i cannot think of a reason why anyone who doesnt have it by now should get it

the great things that anno 2070 and anno 1404 had in them such as continuous play multiplayer oh and freedom b are goneb

dont get me wrong its a beautiful game it really is but the entire game is a campaign designed to make you feel like you have freedom but you dont you dont have a warehouses that fill up when you over produce a good making expansion extraordinarily tedious you have to balance resources without even an inkling into what you are doing wrong in some stages
it is literally quest mission quest mission quest mission the endless cycle like a tf2 map


other reviews saying that uplay is the issue they are wrong just google a work around for loading uplay up program files right click the launcher and open it in administrator mode
uplay isnt the issue for this game the game itself is fucking awful

#####

 i would have to say over all i would give a good review but
this is my first anno game and there are many glitchesproblems with the game that ubisoft should put a tiny bit of effort in for fixesthese should have been fixes years ago 

the graphics are enjoyable the game a good mashup between civ and simcity not a huge story but what is there isnt terrible its just not a big story linearc 

pros game plays pretty smoothly and as you start learning the flow of it you get the hang of itset a time if you want sleep
it doesnt destroy your computer to run even with ucrapimeanplay
i love the day night cycle and doubly so the ability to not only turn it off but pause it at what ever part of the cycle you are 
the farther you get the more areas open up and gives you the lure of going to the next placebut it teaches you quickly you have to really build a super foundation before moving on and every placement matters in the long run 
each sector is different design goods layout limitations etc 
over all its a well made vision of exactly the thing i wanted between simcity and civ while i like those but the perfect combination of juggling buildings finances commodities and layouts and different sectors 
this would be a great series to be able to colonize multiple worlds one sector at a time building a space station deciding if moons and planets have the proper resources building appropriate ships etc ubisoft would have to really put true effort in but they could pull it off 


cons glitches there are a bunch 
trying to grab building which half the time or more you have to multiclick to move 
deleting an areas higher leveling dwellings and the warning keeps giving a zero for locations needed resourcelab pd theatre etc in order to reset it restart the game and usually works though sometimes you have to delete that location and rebuild after restarting again 
scrolling get used to it when going into a sector you will almost always zoom in when scrolling out 
easy to hard barely feel different you can barely tell the game is on any of them unless you are playing the hardest level which means you cant move buildings
while i get the lure of pushing things forward and getting to the moon they probably should have waiting a little longer in game to reach where you could get to the moon especially with how ridiculous the cost is 
the pop ups dear god so help me i want to punch who ever designed the pop up layout shove a pop up in my face and you irritate the hell out of me especially when you dont give me even a semi decent way to get it out of my face
not only are there a ridiculous amount of calamitiesthe same number from normal to hard almost but after fighting enemy ships for the 50th time in your sector and not only beating them in theres and destroying their main base they act like it never happened on top of that quarter to half of the time a new calamity is starting either right as one is ending or right in the middle of another there literally are to many calamities on the normal and easy and hard while its about right im tired of fighting the same guys hour after hour same thing over and over again with low visibility

in the middle but needs a little more assistance is the tutorial a lot of things really important ones tooi had to figure out on my own because the tutorial kinda just says have at it with a few hints along the way that kinda eh mean something 

tldr enjoyable time wastersinkseriously set an alarm clock so you dont play for to long but there are a lot of bugs that probably wont ever be fixed but most have ways around them

#####

i dont understand the negative reviews  there are many complaints regarding autosave which must have been fixed because that isnt a problem for me  other negative reviews are based on comparison to previous anno versions  i havent played previous versions so i dunno about that  but i will say it is far more entertaining than cities skyline more awesome and simply better imho   i found cities a bit tedious on resource management  i know thats an integral part of the game but not to the exclusion of all else

heres a few quick pointers that made my early experience more enjoyable  learnmodify your key bindings in settings  i found myself using copy mode relocation mode and rotate building extensively   the various camera view options are really cool especially rotating the camera around current position   after i achieved balance of resources i zoomed in and set the camera to rotate in the middle of my town with promotion set to automatic   watching the buildings upgrade automatically as the camera rotates is awesome  there is no denying the sheer beauty and elegance of the graphics particularly on zoom in  this game is fantastic    i look forward to many more hours with anno  


#####

dont buy ubisoft gamesthey make thier offline games online mandatory and their shitty launcher refuses to work so you may not be able to play ur game that u have boughtmy 32 hrs isnt coming from playing itit comes from a steam card earning programfirst time i installed it was more then a year ago maybe more then two and when i considered a re installing i wanted to check to reviews and i see that the problem havent been solved yetthe ceo of ubisoft have expressed his opinion on game ownership as in he wants us to not own them and be happy about it if we can reach them via subscriptionsi think they delibaretely treat their older games badly because i remember being able to play ac odyssey before installing this game for the first time and even tho problems occured i was able to give it a 67 hrsso i am suspicious that they just make their older games just unplayable for the jist of iti realy dont like the way game corpos direction and i hate that even their older games are affected by it and steam doesnt have a way of securing the customers eitherubisoft can just make its older games suddenly  online launcher dependentsome games just gets a update to their system requirements that makes it unplayable for my current systemi shouldnt experience this kind of problemsidk if steam censores it or something so i am going to say just drm free gamesversions i think was the most player friendly games and looks like it will keep its value the samei shouldnt be punished for paying for a game but somehow i am

#####

first negative review ill try to keep it brief the games okay built solid no bugs looks great has a lot of personality but past the looks its boring the play cycle is repetitive and since you need to balance production across multiple sectors its annoyingly repetitive you try do do something in the a place then you see you need more resources from a second place go there then you find out in order to supply the first place from the second place you need resources from a third place it becomes even more unbearable towards the end of the game when you are trying to balance 20 resources in massive quantities it also has navy battles which are also boring after the first couple and feel like the devs realized how little there is in the game and tried to spice it up with resource rewards but you could never play any of them and not miss a thing the dlcs are passable i didnt even touch two of them lastly and this is a bit more personal ubisoft has the game run through its terrible launcher and has a lot of bonuss and cosmetics locked behind their ubisoft club which is stupid because you pay for the full game all in all i did have some fun and dont regret buying it but if you asked me if i recommend it id say no if you are really dying to play it catch it on a sale its not worth full price which is a shame it has so much potential

#####

after years of avoiding this purchase because of the never ending negative reviews i decided to pick it up on sale  and all i can say is i dont understand what all the hate is about

ive been playing the anno series for years starting way back on my dell dimension desktop more than 10 years ago  yes anno 2205 is quite different compared to the previous games but i have to admit its a bit of breath of fresh air as the previous games felt more like reskinned versions of themselves with new graphics and not much else

anno 2205 has some annoying aspects mainly the battles being completely separate from the economic parts of the game but overall id say this purchase was well worth the 20 or 25 i dropped on it cant remember which it was now as this was only one of more than a dozen games i picked up in the last two weeks

as far as dlc goes i have a bit of a unique insight as i spent two years running an indie game company and i know first hand how some gamers expect the world for free 

if companies are going to continue producing dlc gamers have to be willing to pay a fair price for it then its a winwin

#####

ive been looking forward to this game for awhile and after 220hrs playing anno 2070 i thought this game would be such an awesome upgrade

i was very wrong the entire style of game has changed once you build everything there is very little balancing and no challenges it dosnt follow the style that the anno series was so successful with

sure the graphics are great but that dosnt make up for the lack of replayability 23 hours in and i wish i didnt buy it  so dissapointing

#####

not even starting on the actual gameplay i regret to have supported a company who does what theyre doing the game on release and still today is full of real important bugs to name just a few and these are commonly found trough players just google anno 2205 bugs and youll see for yourself your command ship dissapearing completly from the game causing you to be basicly glitched stuck because you need it to complete important missions huge memoryleak reported on several high end systems upto 11gb ram usage
these kind of bugs combined with the incredible slowness of how its being fixed or even talked to the community about it is just unacceptable for a game you pay 60 for

now about the gameplay in short its very nice but far from what probably 80 of the anno fans would have expected in this new game like no scenarios no mp no coop no custom mapspve 
the only thing there is to play and replay is a 20h long tutorial which really becomes a one time at the most two time play the overal management is reduced to the thinking of a 12 year olds and makes it very unsatisfactory to play in the end

so for the people who actually are having doubts about purchasing i would highly recommend you use google for half an hour and decide after that

greetings



#####

so anno games are great time sinks they have some interesting game mechanics but at the end of the day whatever youre creating just feels very sterile your cities have nothing to make them interesting no character the game basically selects against any kind of interesting layout this is what always left me feeling disappointed after spending hours fiddling around with whatever i just built

#####

i loved it while i was playing it for almost 8 hours but then theres a serious issue with the game saves dont work you cant manually save either at first i lost 2 hours of progress because the game save wasnt synced second time i played for almost 6 hours making sure the autosave was on and i was constantly trying to save my game but then the exact same thing happened i lost all the progress  will be requesting a refund asap

#####

dumbed down and boring when its compared to any of the previous anno games its sleek and pretty but limited when it comes to city design managment is as simple as plonking buildings down and watching numbers go updown

its hard to call it a sandbox when there are no random maps

#####

this game feels astonishinly like a mobile base building game yet without microtransactions the best way i can describe it is it as a weird cross between factorio and a mobile game and i like factorio and it sortof works in this game

some parts can be very frustrating building a bridge for instance to gain acess to a new section of the map can take 1020 minutes you cant speed it up you can only provide the resources you have to figure out for yourself how to make money and how to optimize how you spend it whitch is annoying because your economy will stall if you dont

i have enjoyed this game so far so i would recommend it

#####

this would be a good game if the tutorial campaign didnt make you do the whole campaign b4 you can run a proper fun game the problem lies mainly in the fact that they give you the arctic and moon which are all but impossible to make money out of and thus you run a deficit as big as the national debt its still buggy and things dont attach as they should in the little scenarios ive played the whole anno series and this is worse by far than any of them its not fun and extremely frustrating the graphics are good and being futuristic it looks good but the game isnt fun im glad i didnt pay the full price

#####

its different than the other anno games in the series and unfortunately not in a good way i loved anno 1404 and 2070 a great amount so much so i rebought anno 1404 on steam years after i lost the cd for it

but this game is just boring grind through a lackluster campaign with combat as a minigame feeling alien to the rest sailing is next to nonexcistant which the anno series was so recognizible with the quest with your command vehicles is both irritating and boring 

on the plus side the visuals are astonishing looking great in all aspects but unfortunately this is a dubble edged sword as performance and optimization are average at best

allinall id recommend to avoid this game and go for anno 1404 or anno 2070 instead
additionally i truely hope blue byte and ubisoft go back and make anno 1800 with the old formula

#####

a much simplified anno if you just want a relaxing and rather beautiful game this is it combats a tad annoying but can mostly be avoided

#####

played anno 2070 great game this one just a little bit meh compared to the last one great game absolutely gorgeousjust really really repetitive its one giant exercise in you can make most people happy most of the time and that is it same missions over and over again collect a bunch of garbage we dropped all over tow it back to me get money and ill help you complete task x oh we went to the moon as well go pick up my garbage in an even slower vehicle and bring it back to me so i can respect you and help you with task x 

butit is such a pretty game and when the city is all built up and working well for you it is absolutely gorgeous 

seven apples and 11 spoons of peanut butter for this one 

btw my review scale is all over the place

#####

greetings fellow gamers

uthis is my 1st reviewu
my history with anno franchise  i have played all of the anno games since the very first one i loved every game to the bone playing more than 500 hours each i loved the intricate system in which you guessed the consumption of your citizens the trade that you could create and all of those good things the game had

bupdate 11b
	as various posters wrote i check and found that indeed there are stockpiles what i find lacking is the ability to do something with said stockpile atm i am already established in the luna zone i dont know what to do with my excess i cannot sell it to an npc or let my warehouse sell the items
	more mechanics have appeared artic zone compels you to build housing within range of factories which produce heat if you do not build the houses within range of heat sources they will not function at all this is cool because it tends to make you fashion towns based on your factories instead of the usual clump of housing luna on the other hand needs to have all of the buildings protected with shield generators to avoid radiation and meteor strikes i find this part super cool
	as more your progress your resources take a new spin mainly you cash turns out to be a rather important item factories start to cost 45000 credits which can be a hefty sum heck even housing costs this makes money way more important than in previous anno games which focused on the goods produced i still prefer the old approach


h1anno 2205h1
the game is indeed oversimplified as it was stated on videos by the company but hell i never expected the game to be dumbed down
at first glance the first new feature is the fact that the people who work in the city now indeed work which is a cool addition your population now means something else besides taxes but thats it i havent found a way to increase or lower tax rates and now i need to have everything in the island connected with a road i remember my storehouses connected with the farms and that was it
production was completely destroyed you now have buildings which state how much amount of something they produced which is cool but takes away from the tinkering of preview anno games so you know exactly how much of a given building you need to get resource a there are no stockpiles so if you have surplus of a resource it wont get stored therefore you cannot sell that resource and trade with npcs you may upgrade production buildings with different stuff such as more production of said resource less workerenergysupply maintenance of course all of these upgrades cost special materials which are acquired by doing quests andor fighting the warzone maps i have only experienced one shortage of a product because i rushed in on a quest finally resources have been tampered with rivers are gone and in with the coast slots just a cosmetic change in my opinion
fleets are gone and this surely pisses me off id love building boats and acquiring defenses for my towns i remembered popping my first transports creating connections between my islands well that is gone the only trade in existence now is between the different zones more of that ahead if zone a produces more than 5 of x you can trade that to zone b continuing with fleets you now have warzones or whatever they are called in which you are provided with an amount of ships and you have to complete a certain target capture a point destroy x objective and so forth you only interact with your ship by purchasing upgrades for the different models you are given fielding a fleet by manufacturing the goods gathering the cash and building a shipyard yeap that is all gone you cannot create controls to you ships you can select all of them with the tab key
there is no save icon or option i had my brain going nuts about it today i hope the save is still there cause in the end i left my corporation by leaving the whole game
you got zones now which are basically the different areas in which you produce different goods ala europeanarabic island from anno 1404 or ecotycoontechunderwater island from anno 2070 thing is they are on a whole different map wtf you now have temperate artic and luna so if you need product x produced at artic on temperate you go to the world map if artic has surplus of said product you select it and create a route to temperate done no real boast involved no nothing just a few clicks
i truly cannot find the challenging layer from other anno games in this one it is completely simplified and not in a good way
factions are gone no more ecos or tycoons which blows for me but then again they did announce it on the trailers still there are factions aka good guys vs bad guys
combat is simplified yeap there is not even that rockpappersicsors thing from the lastone you now have various boats which surely have those capabilities but since you never really build up your forces you just horde the enemy slightly smaller horde after the skirmish you heal up with the fuel dropped by the enemy rinse and repeat
ui is amazing and up to day standards sleek transparent and cool looking graphics are mindblowing but i sometimes get stutters i run the game with 16gb a ssd drive and a 290x graphic card the water physics are cool and everything about the visuals is amazing there are some in game videos with subpar animations the people look like they were brought from 2003
i could not find any skirmish modes or some way to play multiplayer i shall be updating this review with more hours played though

h1tl drh1
uprosu
	game is beautiful and the views are amazing from the dazzling buildings to the waves in the sea
	ui is amazing sleek minimalistic and very modern
	id say this game would be ok for someone entering the anno series it is a very very simplified version of original annos  this of course is a con for those of us already engaged with the series
	you now know how much stuff is produced from each building
uconsu
	no trade just a simplified version between zones
	no storage just positive and negative outputs
	since you now know how much is produced for those experienced anno players the difficulty depth was taken away
	no ships you make do with what you are given you can upgrade your boats but thats it
	to those knowledgeable with other annos you will find this game too simplistic and should avoid it stick with the other older versions

hope this was valuable for you

will try to keep playing to get to know the game better

review written for 2205  season pass if that matters

i rather liked anno 2070 so i really wanted to like this game when it came outand then it came out and i had other things to do and there were enough negative reviews i didnt want to get it  when it went on sale i noticed it again and finally picked it up despite the mixed reviews  perhaps hoping that it would be a good game despite the stated flaws

and so far i havent actually noticed any major flaws

 the game doesnt have multiplayer  true  dont care i dont play multiplayer
 supply chains arent real time  theres shades of truth to this but not as a meaningul problem  in 2070 if factory b needed factory a to produce good a as an input so it could start production of good b you had to wait 20 seconds for factory as production cycle to complete then for the good to be shipped and itheni factory b would kick offand then you had to wait another 20 seconds for factory b to finish  whichdidnt add much once that initial cycle had completed goods would be delivered in time for everything to work smoothly  in 2205 production also works on prospective output so long as theres enough factory power everything moves along  and you know whether you have enough production iimmediatelyi  storage is still a thing surpluses accumulate and will cover shortfalls though the stocks arent listed so far as i can find  overall i ilikei this change i ireallyi like being able to see production balance changes immediately rather than having to wait a few minutes to see just how badly the new production chain is balanced
 combat minigame  well  not in the standard usage combat spawns off to a separate map with a barelyconfigurable fleet and the map can take a while to complete if youre going after all objectives  a new game can be configured to have enemies attack randomly at various levels  presumably forcing you to call your fleet in and defend your territory  mostly ambivalent on this one as rts combat isnt why i snagged anno

production within a single sector is essentially shared without need for setting up transit routes within that map  in trade for that it is now possible to create multiple sectors for the same corporation at the same time and to trade goods between those sectors  this adds an interesting mechanic allowing and requiring multiple verydifferentlydesigned citysets to work together to get the most out of your cities and factories  putting time into research on the orbital level dlc can lead to useful production balance changes or outright change the recipes of some of your goods

there are some minor glitchy bits admittedly  ship movement allows for parts of the ships to pass through each other  and its not a hard thing to see  but thats purely a minor graphical wart  switching between busy sectors can take a little while for my nowaging lastgeneration gaming maching butwell thats partially on me  

overall is a good productionchain game with plenty to do

#####

this is the fall of the best resource management franchise 
it looks like its the ubi hobby they did it with settlers and now anno the 2070 id call a perfect game the jewel they dumbed it all down in 2205 and just like with latest settlers they made it a dlc cashcow 
in my opinion there is only one thing that could revive this game and its random map generator it wont bring the greatness back but will pour some replayability in
dont get me wrong going to moon and back is pretty good experience but what then
conquer all sectors where the only challenges are one time project driven chain quests this is boring
withour real time resource transport the cities feel just dead with no constraints this quickly becomes the game of where is the microchip factory without production expansion sad

game resembles very much sim city societies when you build build build till it looses all appeal

i recommend to buy this game in a year or so when with all dlcs price will drop below 10 eur its a good one time experience you can also buy it before if they include random maps but i really doubt it wil happen

#####

great game one of my favorite city building sims out there i bought this thinking id like it but on my old rig i didnt but fired it up again on my new rig i just built and feel in love with this game id highly recommend it even though it got poor reviews it really is an exciting city builder trust me this is the most epic city builder ive ever played its so freaking great once you get into it and rewarding but you just got to learn how to play and play on expert to learn how its fantastic i love this game

#####

this game received a lot of criticism when it was first released  many compared the game to its predecessor and that is understandable to a degree  however this game has a lot to offer in terms of careful economy management and expansion  it can also come as daunting at first but by trial and error you can slowly learn how to manage your corporation properly  the naval battles are a bit of a let down and come off as regurgitating  they become more of an exhausting and taxing affair once youve done them so many times  that being said there are a lot of customization options available to help people ease into the game before making it challenging later on once you get a grasp on things  i can go into all the little nuances of all the options and game play but that would go on forever and the core anno series aspects remain the same  if this game can be picked up on a sale which they have all the time it is definitely worth some time to get into and give it a shot to form your own opinion

#####

i really like this anno and i honestly cant understand the problem people have with it

yes its not the anno like the ones before or after but this one isnt supposed to be

ive played 167 hours and consider it to my all time favorites

besides the fact it is from ubisoft and you have to use the pile of bugs which is uplay i really recommend it

#####

quick review because i dont feel the game needs more than that if you played and enjoyed the rest of the anno series and want to buy this based on that  then dont 

this game is nothing like the other anno games there is city building there is naval combat there is resource management  but its so distorted it feels nothing like anno the combat system is completely removed from the city building aspect of the game resource management is clunky and the city building feels staged you may as well let the game play for you there is also no custom game feature  why blue byte custom games was probably 90 of what anno fans played

aesthetically the game is appealing the graphics are great but not that far removed from what you saw in 2070 but this isnt anno its almost like ubisoft and blue byte havent completely understood why anno fans enjoyed the game in the first place bought it played under the 2 hour limit and got a refund this is the only anno game i havent enjoyed

#####

ubisoft connect is trash id rather uninstall all of ubisoft products than deal with this trash software

#####

a gorgeous and relaxing experience though ive never played solely the base game this reflects the ultimate edition or season pass

the game isnt nearly as difficult to grasp as others are saying the campaign will take you through the different fundamentals but its done over the course of its entirety you will have the opportunity to tackle different components of the game at your own leisure or urgency and while the campaign will take you there naturally youre free to ignore it or start it as soon as youre able and want to ideally you will have built a significant and profitable city by the time youve even hit the middle part of the games missions on its mechanics

there are three different climates temperate tundra and moon they are less tiered levels one two and three than they are interwoven environments with unique qualities and obstacles

for example to advance your citizens to beyond a certain point in your main temperate city youll need to supply your population with an item that can only be manufactured in the tundra and viceversa youll need to build your houses around your heatgenerating factories so your residents dont dwindle from the cold

but thats not your only option instead of building up the tundra you could simply set up a trade route with the galactic market to supply your temperate city with its advancement needs  so long as you can afford it

the combat is best described as a minigame and not a gameplay focus but its a pleasant distraction you can fail missions so when youre down to your last ship on the hardest difficulty it can offer the sense of gravity that success and defeat bring

build beautiful cities and inseminate the arctic and moon at your own pace
this game deserves a positive rating at least

#####

this is the perfect city builder for me endless supply chains zero sense of urgency and optional combat things break often but theres no game over state so you get to fiddle and tweak until you solve the supplychain issue helps that its beautiful to look at but probably the most impressive thing outside of the supply chain is that you create cities across multiple parts of the planet and the moon and in orbit that can exchange vital components between each other

for example as your citizens are promoted they require more and more complex goods to keep them happy and some of these can only be created in particular locations leading to webs of trading to balance all of your settlements

cant believe i missed this one when it came out i think i saw screenshots and thought it was anno 2070 again as it is 2205 is the best in the series and thanks to the futuristic setting its unlikely that the upcoming 1800 will unhorse it

#####

its annowithout the anno if your a fan of the series i highly recommend sticking with anno 2070 this new addition while having its moments simply does not par up to the series standards main points to note

 less buildings and variety of buildings
 cannot sell surplus to anyone but global market which is very expensive
 game is easy and lacks the feel of accomplishment offered by previous titles
 preallocated building plots for everything minus housing and extended production facilities
 no skirmish or random generation of land masses
 mini battles are repetative and by that i mean there are like 23 maps used endlessly

initially approved a late regret and now feeling worse off a total shame

after owning this game for almost 2 years i finally had the time and motivation to really dig into it  i have to say its been an enjoyable adventure  now im addicted to it and find my self having to limit my time spent with it  ive enjoyed discovering the new levels and what they unlock for  you

#####

all was good until i got to end game then it felt like an unfinished game whats the point of reaching the moon if theres no threat or goal in sight up there feels like they ran out of budget once they got to the moon lol

needs more story related content short stories flavor text anything but this dull dreary moon buildgrind

#####

meh mediocre gameplay inscrutable mechanics wooden combat oh and ubisoft connect im not going to enter a password everytimeiplay uninstalled after 5 hours

#####

ubisoft connect is garbageand youre forced to install it from this publisher

#####

i dont know why there are many bad reviews on this game the uplay is annoying but doesnt affect the game at all i bought this game on sale and for the price its a great game 75 if you have potato pc dont even try to play with it i have to keep my graphics settings on high to achieve 60fps gtx 1070 paired with r5 1600 and 16gb ram i would recommend this game for someone who likes play casually still wants to have some challenge on higher difficulty levels

#####

great game totally ruined by ubisoft launcher which so far ive spent half an hour trying to log in wont accept password change password 2step authentication wont log in change password you get the picture  god knows why you cant just launch this from steam like every other game on the planet

#####

alright im still having problems understanding why this game gets panned  i played through it at release and enjoyed it and then today i decided id check it out again as i had a craving and had bought the season pass

being a fan of the previous installations in the series this game is very similar in a lot of ways and i think has really built on the franchise in a positive way  

most notably combat has been for the most part separated from the main game which i like  i always felt the combat in dawn of discovery to be lackluster at best and detracted from the true nature of the game  2070 did okay with it but i like that combat in 2205 is segregated into separate missions which are effectively optional for the most part  

the game instead really capitalizes on the city building resource management and trading  the dlc has proven fun so far having played around with the orbital station and the tundra zone

frankly if you liked the main premise of the original games in the series and didnt really care about the combat aspect so much i really think it would behoove you to give this most recent sequel a try

i think ubi actually deserves some credit for this one  its gorgeous runs great has all the polish youd expect from a aaa game and truthfully is really fun

my 002 ymmv

#####

impossible to conect a ubisoft  i cant play the game

#####

im so glad i got around to trying this the negative reviews nearly made me skip it its early days but i think i actually prefer it to the earlier games in the series and i dont think the changes are as dramatic as people have made out in other reviews and are mostly moves in the right direction i agree the combat isnt the greatest but it wasnt great in any other anno either

#####

i am very disappointed in this game

it is boring i played over 1000 hours of anno 2070 i stop playing this a long time ago out of boredom

the missions are dull the combat missions are dull 

the story is nonexistent the competition was just numbers to beat

there is absolutely no complexity

congrats on producing a game through focus groups so you can get a little more of the market

i purchased the season pass i will not be purchasing a season pass again for any game after this

ubisoft did it again i believe they are the masters at making franchises boring

#####

looks really nice but the game is super tedious and repetitive here is the main gameplay

build building a 100 times along with some support structures
you unlocked a new area build a reskin of building a 100 times there too
you unlocked building b which requires you to build 100 more of building a
build 100 building bs
and so forth

#####

it looks like an anno game it has some not most features of an anno game but plays like a simcity game
i love the graphics the new hud the whole idea of colonizing the moon but is way too easy and boring the mini enemy game is the worst change of all if some players dont want enemies attacking their cities should have added an option to turn off enemies in map instead of this makes me think twice before replaying

as an anno fan i feel very disappointed with this release first with the preorder beta lie blame ubisoft on this and now with a game that is not much of fun than anno 2070 or 1404

hope the upcoming dlc make it a bit less unsatisfying
for now i cant recommend the game

#####

i got sucked into a couple hundred hours of 2070 after eyeing this game and seeing some negative reviews  200 hours in i couldnt take it anymore and my impulse got the better of me  im glad i bought it  

one of the negative things i read was that it was a watered down anno because you dont set up actual ships on trade routes anymore  while thats true you still have to set up trade routes and balance them sometimes fairly intricately

the aesthetic of this game is just awesome  its just so cool as a city builder to organically watch all the details progress over time  seeing the shipping lanes form on your islands as skyscrapers build up around city centers or on the moon as your radiation shields absorb asteroids 

if youre a fan of the supply chain aspect of anno this game is better in every way than 2070  

a couple negative things i felt  the naval combat while still better than 2070s system still feels pretty detached and after a while repetative  also the side missions from various other corps are just as boring as before but this time theyre worthless in terms of rewards as well unless youre in a pinch  also i miss the whole ecological balancing aspect although there are other new things to balance

overall i couldnt say id ever go back to 2070 after playing this  its great

#####

so 55198 achievements and i had to write this review just so people know what they are buying and i will start by saying that anno 2205 is a sim city builder with a twist in that it tries to incorporate a series of things that you wont find in other sim city building games such as military units and defence strategys it is quite interesting but in doing this they have left out some features that you would expect in a modern sim city builder such as transportation and water supplies do not need to connect in any way to supply the city and you finds theses similaritys throughout the game mostly the game is centred around production and land types that you will need to produce certain items for other land types and once your up and running it can become a bit repetitive whereby you end up upgrading one city just to upgrade the next to get the resources you need to upgrade again and so on the lands look fantastic and really enjoyable to look at the soundtrack is poor and could have been a lot better game play is great at first but then slowly goes downhill overall it gets a 710 for its scope but that caused the game to loose a lot of features that a modern sim builder should have

#####

failed to synchronize cloud save no manual save there goes hours of gameplay fuck you ubisoft im never playing this again i was having fun but your shitty system just deletes all my progress if it cant save on the cloud

#####

ive played all of the anno games before and i have hundreds of hours on them i have played on the hardest difficulty from when i started this game up for the first time

anno 2205 differs alot from the other anno games and many of the mechanics are more streamlined and dumbed down infinite resources no random maps no multiplayer no ai to battle on the maps where you build your cities and no warehouses or town halls

the anno feel is still here though managing your supplies and juggling betwen regions instead of islands and send materials back and forth betwen your different cities trading is now instant and you dont need boats to do it instead it will cost x ammount of cash to maintain each trading route

for anyone new to the anno series this is probably the best game to start on and for the veterans it is still a polished and bug free game just keep in mind that alot has been changed so that it wont come as a surprise

difficulty is really easy even though im playing on the hardest difficulty generating resources and income is as basic as it gets in a city sim and ive had no problems getting the resource i need planning your cities ahead isnt that big of a deal any more since you can freely move buildings around and since you have no warehouses building a logic road system isnt an issue any more

theyve changed how the industrial buildings work by adding the ability to upgrade them with modules which costs resources you cannot obtain other then by doing missions this does add a sense of missions actually being worthwile but i have so far not ran out of said resource and i always have a surplus of them

battles are now confined to areas where there are no city building you will get a fleet and a mission on a map that you need to complete to get the rewards which consists of rare resources to upgrade your factories you can upgrade said fleet if you have the cash and experience needed and it feels like a nice edition this does mean that there will be no combat where you build your cities though so no defense what so ever is needed in your cities or on your trade routes

you will spend most of your time on three areas temperate artic and the moon each being more expensive to build on and each having its own resources that all of your cities will consume going between them isnt an issue for me but if you dont have a good computer the loading time is probably really laggy and long



all in all its a polished city builder with some really basic trading elements and it would be a great game if the price was lower considering all of the things they removed from previous games like multiplayer i cant see how the price is acceptable as i keep playing i just get this feeling that an dlc will be released sooner rather then later that will add a bunch of the stuff that feels like its missing now and we the players shouldnt accept this buisness model



tldr
get the game on a sale there are more content rich city sims out there that are alot cheaper then this one this feels like a setup for dlcs

#####

if you enjoy a nice peaceful resource managing game anno is here for you plus dlc improve combat alittle more for defending island than just mission oriented combat

#####

to me the anno series has taken what was somewhat annoying with the other games making sure a certain selected ship was on a trade route the difficulty in ship building there is a resource panel that shows positives and negatives in your resouces so you can easily fix its just a lot better of a game and please do not take this to mean it is simple it is entirely complex which makes its very fun and challenging but not annoying there is also a near constant demand for attack missions that are fun if you ever get bored of running your cities hope this helped truly one of my favorite games ever so far

#####

so i got this game on sale with all the expansions that come with it  although i havent reached the sort of end game yet  my save crashed so i basically lost my entire new moon colony  i do believe i have enough experience to tell whether this game is worth getting or not 
short answer is  this game is really relaxing and fun put on your favorite podcast or audio book or your recorded lecture etc grab some beer and popcorn and enjoy the relaxing time you will experience 
now the long answer 
its not a game for everyone  allow me to explain what i mean 
if you want anno 2205 because of a futuristic cities skylines then forget about it and save your money for something else  anno 2205 is not a city management  i repeat not a city management 
so what is it  its an industrial  project  company manager  set in the future you must establish your major company to construct reactors on moon to provide nuclear energy and end the earths energy crisis 
it might sound easy but the depth of the resource management you have to do will amaze you  even more so if you play on hard difficulties 
now my experience with this game so far has been positive and i really like it  but should you buy this game  well  it depends totally on what you want but the following check list should guide you  
you will like this game if  
1  you love managing a big company and its resources 
2  if you like colonizing the moon to produce energy 
3  if you want an average relaxing company manager game set in the future 
4  if you dont mind lack of variety in buildings etc  like i said this is not a city builder  
5  if you dont mind lack of variety in buildings 
if you dont mind the game not being to micromanagement ish style 
if you dont have a problem with these 5 things i mentioned you will enjoy this game a lot 
oh and one more thing  
i highly suggest getting this game on sale and getting it with all the expansions and dlcs this where the game will shine 
and now if youll excuse me i have a colonization i need to prepare for 
peace 

#####

to be very honest i didnt buy the game now for such a long time just because of all the negative reviews i read about it
but two days ago after playing several days in a row anno 1404 venice i decided that it is finally time to have a look at this one
i wasnt disappointed the game is good and to be honest what else did i actually expect it is a game developed by blue byte hell they know how to make an anno game

so at the end i would like to suggest that you give it a try yourself and decide for yourself if you like the game or not because the quality of the game is very high graphics ui processes ux all very good and professional and if you like this type of anno you really should decide for yourself

#####

i dont usually write reviews but i spent countless hours both playing and watching streams of anno 2070 and wanted to give my first impressions i found this game to be simplified but not in a way that was unpleasant for example there is a new window which tells you how much you are consuming and producing of each good this makes it so much easier to balance production chains additionally the move tool is awesome given that i like to rebuild things 

overall based on my 4 hours in the campaign i would recommend this especially if you are on the fence because it is published by ubisoft bluebyte did an excellent job with this game and i am enjoying it so far its both simpl er and more complex than 2070 havent played the other games so cant comment on that running one city is pretty easy but moving up the chain and expanding to having multiple cities is a more interesting thing definitely worth a look at least and i am excited to see what else they do in the future

things that are different
1 multiple theaters in the form of temperate artic and lunar biomes which each have their own gimmicks artic bases are built around factories in order to protect warmth which results in sprawling collections of hamlets while lunar bases are built under forcefields to protect from meteorites i am not sure on this but it looks like you can buy theaters from other corporations once you are ranked higher read more citizens supply chains etc not quite sure what this does yet but it looks like you can you have quite a number of theaters going at once and not just one of each type

2 no manual trade routes for ships in each theater all goods  energy in a theater is instantly traded by a fleet of ships which grows as you do but which you do not control instead you form trade routes between theaters as there are specific items only produced in each one which are demanded by employees in other areas some people will not like this but i think it works due to the fact that you are in multiple theaters at once having to run trade routes manually would cause a lot of lag i think also having a centralized store of goods in each theater makes it easier to expand and develop islands trade between theaters is handled by a space port which you need to build  expand in each theater this means that you need to actually build in each area and cant just load an ark with everything you need credit balance is global as well so you definitely want a big positive balance before building expensive stuff in the artic for example all in all i dont miss the setting of routes that much

3 combat at least in the campaign is removed from the central gameplay by making it an optional side mission which rewards you with resources you can use to build modules combat puts you in command of a few ships with abilities which you can power up from drops in the map ships can be upgraded over time but the upgrades are linear per ship

4 modules this is the big one in 2070 you built these massive collections of fields in the hopes that you built enough for the demands you needed fields had to be attached to each farm here farms run on their own but you can add modules in exchange for resources the modules do different thing such as boost productivity more productivity than you would get with another farm at the same resource cost reduce workers needed to maintain the place or lower energy consumption modules in each theater use different special resources i have found that the way to go at least so far is to build a farm and then build up modules before building a new farm this lets you save space

5 mountain sites you can build any resource gathering field on any appropriate mountain  water site

6 move tool oh god yes you can move any factory farm or building even between islands for a nominal fee  free i forget which this is amazing in the campaign i built up my first island with people and production but ran out of room i upgraded my production facilities with modules in a random fashion and then moved all the population to another island i demolished the buildings then i moved my existing farms and factories to something that both worked and was visually pleasing without a massive loss of resources coupled with a central storage of goods in each theater you can easily rebuild islands whereas it would have been prohibitively time consuming in 2070 this encourages you to expand organically

7 graphics are very very pretty its not crysis but it all feels real enough to let you get lost in the game

8 production balance window this is actually a massive thing and cant believe i put it this low you have a window small one which you can see by hitting v which shows you all your goods it shows you the production and consumption this was need in 2070 as you often had massive surplus or massive shortages now that you have modules you can slowly increase your capacity so you keep pace with what is really needed this makes it a lot easier for people to get into building cities i think that isnt to say that you lose all complexity though now that you work in different theaters you need to produce goods for your own theater as well as others it becomes a game of balancing things in a region and then figuring out what is needed elsewhere the system plays together nicely and prevents newer people from dying instantly due to lack of consumer electronics or whatever


#####

the majority may dislike this game especially the anno purists but ive found myself enjoying it  2070 was the gold standard for me and though 2205 is a vast departure from that design it isnt as bad as many claim it to be  i agree that the game is a little too simplistic and could be fleshed out in a few ways to offer more depth  there are what i would consider to be some missed opportunities  but when i combine the good and the bad i still come away wanting to recommend it  if i were to assign a percentage id say 60 of me likes it while 40 of me is left scratching my head over some of the shallow design decisions

here are a few positive bullet points

 the game is beautiful  even on my gtx 760 the game runs very well 
 setting up the balance of goods and trade routes is actually pretty enjoyable  that being said this is pretty much the centerpiece of the game  this is all you need to do but that task has a lot of subtasks
 as simplistic as the game is i cant seem to get enough of it  that may change and i often question the replayability but so far im having a good time
 while i am not blown away by the storylines in each sector i do enjoy the overarching questline to achieve something  this also adds to the balance difficulty as im expanding  if i need to increase a specific commodity its usually something really expensive to produce ive had to be pretty careful in that venture as to not begin hemorrhaging cash  i lost my first game as i was powering through the content and quests  before i knew it i was in the red and couldnt figure out where things went wrong  2205 will surprise you if you arent careful  
 as you upgrade your buildings the challenge to meet the needs of the new demographic presents itself prominently  this is where you can really screw yourself over if you arent careful 

here are my reservations about the game

 the miniquests in each area are a waste of time  once youve done about 56 of the variations its a repetitive and mundane task to do the quests unless you need the reward 
 there is a distinct lack of depth on the resource side  you create specific resources in specific regions  no prereq required just jump right in  for me i missed the challenge of obtaining the correct fertility and building an island around the production of that resource  
 also on the resource side when you build the buildings the resources are immediately available theres no delay to allow production to ramp up and give you the feeling that there are some logistical challenges in opening a new factoryfarm etcsmall detail but it was strange at first
 combat is separate from your region builds  im not sure i understand this design decision to be honest if it werent for the pestering of the npcs to do my combat missions or the fact that id end up low on a rare resource id probably never do them when i do complete the missions its not a very robust system  i hold down my  key a lot to speed things up and even if i lose a few ships completing it on expert difficulty isnt insurmountable 

its not a bad game by any means  
did it fall short  most certainly  the side quests and combat are questionable 
will you still enjoy it  i believe you will if you give it a chance start building up your moon colonies and youll see what i mean 

update  im still playing this game  i really feel that anyone passing on this game will be missing out  whats amusing is that i think i make the majority of my rare materials from the anno 2205 asteroid miner smartphone game  i havent had to do a military mission since i posted this review  one day youll buy his game and agree with me  whether its now or when its on sale for 5 dollars in 3 years 
im very much looking forward to wildwater bay

update 2 this didnt age well the asteroid miner app went away which is not a big deal and expected but does mean farming the rare resources will take longer the game is definitely not 5 dollars like my prediction maybe with a sale its actually 50 with all the dlc 
years later its still enjoyable for what it is a casual city builder with resource management in a future setting with many hours of gameplay

#####

most casual of all annos really good if you want to play some strategy for relaxation not for any challenge

#####

admittedly im quite a casual gamer and have never played the anno series until 2070 of which i only spent less than 200 hours on as thus im only comparing this game to anno 2070 

tldr a mild yes and before anything else uplay was not an issue 

con
admittedly aspects of this game are indeed a bit too simple there is no longer a need to control ecobalance of which i actually found to be the most fun or manage your production chains as much instead of having to check your stocks and add storage to see how much resources your growing islands need you look at a tab integrated into the ui and do simple arithmetics to see how many more production chains do you need also quite a large disappointment is the fact that i cant now manage to sell stuff to npcs by building my own boats or wage wars by building my own airplanes micromanaging your own transportation route was so much fun and the lack of that ability is indeed disappointing 

overall this means that there is less to do to manage your enterprise you sort of just keep on plopping down stuff check spreadsheet make sure your balance is high and keep on plopping down stuff anno 2070 for me was plopping down stuff constantly as well but aside from the plot efficiency managing you also had to think a bit more about how to organize your transportation routes and so forth 

meh
crisis sectors are the only real places of combat although this means that at least you dont have to worry about your islands being ruined they didnt need to have taken out normal shipbuilding as well 

quests eh theyre sort of like the previous game you pick up stuff you find stuff you hand it to the quest giver and get some resources or cash playing on standard this often gives you a lot of rare resources of which sometimes you may not need but having is better than not having i guess 

personally im ok with having no coast buildings other than the slot ones however i wouldve liked to control where i placed my own port the slots they give often requires you to place extra long roads to connect and with the fact that you cant build warehouses to control your transportation this forces you to tie everything into the same road network production layouts that was closed on the outside like in 2070 now requires extra roads to connect and nothing on the interior other than expanding your building 

pro
as much as people say gameplay over graphics the graphics is absolutely wunderbar like certainly the most beautiful citybuilding game out there at the moment the temperate region is ok but the chilly arctic and the foreign moon just completely blew me away and i was running on low with reduced resolution as a macbook pro isnt exactly designed for gaming the visual attention to details as well as the small audio blips like from the last game really adds the sense of immersion in this game to the point where when i get my desktop back im going to just have a monitor dedicated to only run the game in postcard mode and turn on the daynight cycle 

although the plot is fairly weak the game was never about plot bits and pieces of carryover from 2070 gives a good feeling seeing humanity recover from the great disaster that set the stage for 2070 

ending words
once again i never played previous anno games other than 2070 even compared to 2070 this game is a fairly simple game that indeed doesnt have that much depth this certainly makes the game less challenging however i personally enjoy the less amount of things to think and worry about as i want to play a game to relax and have a good time with its clear ui simplified mechanics and the stunning graphics i can definitely recommend this game maybe not so much grabbing it right now but when its on sale some times later id say that this game is definitely worth it

#####

after reading the many negative reviews from people who played it for less than an hour  some were even from people who played for 30 minutes  then reading the reasons for the negativity i just want to warn you guys about the accuracy of some of the claims ive played all the annos and loved them i purposely did not read the reviews until i got it for myself and played for 6 hours i already know a lot of the bad reviews would solely be over the fact that you have to use uplay lo and behold i got it right 

first i want to say give the game about 5 hours of gameplay thats about how long it takes to really feel the game as a whole and see what it can bring and if you like what its bringing

im going to talk about the game first when i just started i felt like the game was a bit fast in terms of progression and i was breezing through it i wasnt forced to micromanage right away like the older annos now am i saying that the game is easy like the others claim it to be no not at all for those who never played any anno series i think starting with this one would be best because the game starts off easily enough however i think they designed it this way so that you can reach the point of the game where you now have to be aware of your resources and if leveling up your people into higher tier shiny buildings can cause you to not have adequate resources for your regionscities it pretty much wants you to get to the meat of the game fast but once you get to that point you have to take your time  also unlike the other anno series where you have to check your cities on the other islands constantly this time around you just need to simply  go back and forth from the temperate region the arctic and finally the moon once you hit the arctic region thats when the fun starts

again you must be willing to invest more than 2 hours to really experience what the game is capable of although as ive mentioned earlier i really recommend 5 when you start having colonies in the arctic region you must ensure they have enough heat sources which they can get from the factories you plop down they have a heat radius from there you must make sure that your other region is trading enough of what they need and vice versa its more streamlinedtrade flow than the other annos 

the moon is my current challenge because its very expensive to colonize you also have to make sure that you have the protective shield around your colony so they dont get smashed into smitherins by them asteroids 

aesthetic wise the game is gorgeous very beautiful and i just love going in postcard mode just looking around my settlements the only issue i have with this is it might need a bit more optimization my desktop can run skyrim with all the heavy mods in ultra setting with no issues but i get drops of fps here and there with this game not so bad though and not often but i feel it will be a bit of an issue later on when i have more things congregated in one spot 

bugs currently no bugs for me 

interface i love the interface on this one that one they optimized well 

battle system i never liked that part on any of my annos because i always felt them lacking however i liked what they did on this one very much you now have to have fuel in order to do certain things with your vessels like repair but at the same time you can salvage around for the special abilities as i call em you can get them from enemies you sunk or just floating around this revamp made battling enjoyable for me 

im not saying the negative reviews dont deserve to be heard but generally with games like these its best to eye the ones that invested a big chunk of time before putting a negative reviews reviews such as ugh uplay bad game or no mp well f this game tis horrible isnt exactly something to go by sadly it repels other gamers from getting the game and they end up missing out on a game they have the potential of investing a lot of time and enjoyment in 

againive played the other annos i actually like this game a lot i read some inaccuracies on a bit of negative reviews which made me realize they obviously did not invest a couple hours at least in the game its not water downed its a bit different from the previous anno but it brings its own flavor of difficulties with it 

thats about it i dont want to invest too much time on others reviews than the actual game itself in my review i hope i pointed certain things out enough that it will encourage you to make your own decisions luckily steam has a refund policy so you always have that option 

ps do not listen to those who said even on youtube it has a negative review no most of them are quite positive i know because ive been watching a lot of em before  i bought the game also theres a lot of fair reviews about the game and i saw it was a pretty consistent b average a lot of the ratings ive seen so far were averaging 8 

cant wait for the expansion this will satiate me til fallout 4 is in front of my doorstep 

#####

contrary to many reviews i quite like this game it is different from its predecesors and i find the new approach refreshing and positive if i were to criticise it would be the lack of maps and hence limited replayability and no multiplayer

#####

overall rating 3 out of 5 

100 hour edit 4 out of 5 the more i play this the more i like it conquering veteran difficulty is very satisfying 

this game is not bad as some of the reviews would have you believe on the other hand its not really that good either 

i wasnt expecting a rehash of anno 2070 when i bought this nor did i want a rehash of an older game although i truly do love anno 2070 i wantedand receiveda fresh game with fresh mechanics this is that game 

for example there are no longer islandspecific fertilities instead you occupy regions and produce regionspecific goods therefore you dont need the complex interisland trade routes instead your trade routes are from region to region to me thats fine and i dont know why people complain about it so much

instead of building modules or finding modules for your islands you can add modules to your production plants and get bonuses from the orbital station with dlc and through industry bonuses in the stock market the tundra dlc will let you crank out the equivalent of crack for your factories

combat invasions with the frontiers dlc can bankrupt your company if you get invaded just after an expensive build or purchase usually its just annoying though actually the invasions are pretty much always annoying

those parts for me are fine except annoying invasions the parts that detract from the experience are having to enter special combat zones over and over again for rare materials and the play balance in veteran mode makes for a lot of waiting around while your credits or materials slowly accumulate if you can get past those few irritations then youll probably find yourself spending alot of time in anno 2205

#####

game is very disappointing to be honest i gave it a fair chance played through the main story and the tundra add on 
after all this i can safely say this is the worst anno ever made there are only 2 combat maps which the game forces the player to replay over and over and you can only get a maximum of 6 ships you cant build anymore also when you do get an invasion you call your ships to the area but you cant build any defences and the enemy is insanely easy to beat
secondly there is no multiplayer function at all which for me with anno 2070 gave it the most replay value the tundra add on uses a lot of the same building models with new paint jobs and the game in general reuses a lot of models from anno 2070
all in all there is no replay value at all the game is relative and is just a very lazy attempt dont waste your money



#####

now then 

if you like games which are essentially pretty wrappers to spreadsheets then youll like the anno series if you havent played an anno game start with 2070

if you liked anno 2070 then youll like this i got the gold version on a steam sale and theres lots going on without the dlc it may be harder to recommend tundra dlc is a bit mediocre but it adds a certain something in many ways its simplified from 2070 but its also now with all the dlc still quite fun slightly different supply lines and slightly different thinking make it different enough to be interesting 

also this suffers from pretty hideous memory leaks 16 gig fills over the course of 2 hours then it crashes when you exit but i havent had an actual crash yet so thats something 

youll also want to drop aa down to 2x unless you like awful frame rates ive got a gtx970 and play lots of games on ultra but this not so much its not my rig its just the poorly optimised game code

#####

a total hoax the game appeared at first glance to have complex mechanics on building city and expanding industries but as the game progress you dont do anything than building more houses thats it the game is badly balanced that expanding production chain and trading in anyway will punish your economy instead so the game expect you to only build more houses export and import to and from the moon will exhaust your income you better off selling those goods to moon traders and get money from them to build more house keep building more and more houses until you are bored and already spend too much time on this game to ask for refund

the game put you into the role of a corporation owner but nothing in the game is like owning a corporation

#####

i am a big anno fan and i have put about 400hrs into anno 2070 i had no problem spending 90 cad on the gold version provided there were no microtransactions i was really excited about 2205 but after playing it i cannot recommend it the start of the game is easy and boring sure it gets more complex as you go but its not as fun as previous titles the game forces you to bounce between sectors to manage production chains but first you have to wait for that sector to load first oh and if you want to optimize those chain you will be waiting for those sectors a lot plus the games sector map lags and drops frames when you are loading into a sector so you get to hear an npc stutter about a quest they want you do i keep telling myself it will get better after a few more hours but it doesnt

in my opinion there are some changes for the better but boy are there a lot of changes for the worse lets start with the negatives they dumbed down anno 2205 a lot production chains have been shortened and there are now less setting the difficulty to hard does not make the game hard it only slows you down you cannot fail unless you try to no one in this game can touch you the ais can do nothing to you they are only there to give the illusion of competition there are no fires floods pirates or disasters of any kind there are unlimited resources apparently the future is a perfect world i remember the devs talking about how no one wanted fires floods pirates or disasters of any kind people only wanted to build a city news flash you could turn all of those off in prior games if i wanted to only build a city i would do that in cities skyline  no wonder they canceled the beta the crisis zone is a joke you can run in lose all your ships and they just get replaced next time for free you cannot customize your ships but rather press the upgrade button to level them up all of your actions in this game have no consequences

there are parts of this game that are interesting such as in the arctic we have to heat homes with the heat radius of production buildings the modules are interesting as you can get perks with global elections the ability to move buildings is nice

there is only one way to play this game just keep expanding in previous anno games you could play different scenarios such as residents pay no taxes earn all income from trade these scenarios were very interesting and provided much replay value in 2205 there is no replay value you build up your corporation thats it your done there is no sand box mode there are no random seeded maps you can only play the campaign which doubles as the tutorial i could go on and on about this game but i think you get the point oh and you cannot place trees where you want

#####

just dont play this game  it becomes an addiction and you will loose hundreds of hours of your life to it  did i mention that it is easy to safe and get out of the game if life calls

#####

not a bad game when i got this initially i tried to get back into it and unable to connect to uplay launcherseems like i am unable to play the game anymore i would avoid this game until they fix their launcher

#####

unlike every other version of anno 2205 does not have a custom game feature suddenly i understand why this game is disliked

#####

i have played all of the anno games and almost all of them have a really good story artstyle music lore but with anno 2205 all of that is gone and im not saying that lightly there is no story it looks like anno 2070 it soundtrack is a fail attempt
so if you are looking for a good game i can recommend anno 2070 it is far more better than this piece of failure

#####

ive played anno 2070 and this one so my perspective on the franchise is limited to those two games if you liked 2070 you will probably like this one

i liked the city building and resource management in the first one but was annoyed by a couple of features that were mostly addressed in 2205 in 2070 it was hard to tell specifically how much of a good i needed to produce for my population this was particularly difficult when my main island didnt have the fertility for all of the crops i needed making me grow them off site there was no way to control the supply chains easily with any precision if i was low on rice or something i would just built some more paddys and hope it was enough with 2205 it is easy to see if you are producing more or less than you need and by exactly how many units at any time and as you build a new tuna cannery or whatever you can see instantly what impact that had on meeting your demand 

and the concept of having different products created on different islands in 2070 was replaced with having different terrains temperate arctic lunar in 2205 in this new version its a lot easier to precisely control the transfer of products between regions 

im only at 10 hours in so i cant speak to the replayability yet but the basic campaign seems fun also i bought all of the dlc sale and its hard to tell what is from the original and what is added but thats not a complaint it just means i cant review it properly 

after 10 ish hours i am very happy with the game and look forward to playing it more but im not sure it would have been worth full price

#####

just not as deep and enjoyable as 2070  it branched away into some pointless battle missions and forgoit its core of city and supply chain building goodness i hope one day they will make the worthy sucessor to 2070 and 1404 that people want

#####

an intressting addition to the series derives several features from both games although loses one feature of game modes it is just all one big game now which means you will get some annoying quests here and there that are useful game looks fantastic the sense of scale is superb instead of cities of just 300 people you can now have cities of several hundred thousand which makes it feel like you are actually creating something the game feals like it is actually in the future you can build a village of escamos you can build in the space now which feels just as satisying as building underwater if you liked the other games and want more i can fully recommend it as long as you can take uplay drm

#####

let me start by saying i have played all of the previous anno games and have over 200 hours in 2070 this game does not feel at all like an anno game in fact in its current state it feels like a deluxe edition of something youd find on facebook this combined with the bejeweled companion app makes me think they wanted to make the game accessable to a wider audience what happened instead was those people kept playing farmville and anno fans are extremely sad i wanted to love this game i have been googling new anno game for the last four years hoping and eargerly awaiting the news that another game would be made after 2070 so now for the specifics

pros
 game is beautiful watching my rocket launch to the moon and puttering around there were great

cons
 lack of variety while game is beautiful there is very little variety in housing this makes for very boring abeit shiny cities
 no multiplayer
 no map randomization 
 combat is repetitive and combat zones and situations are identical from game to game
 factions play little to no role in this game whereas they did in anno 2070 in this game youll get an occasional message from one of them telling you they passed you in the rankings or that you passed them
 no meaningful visable storage what people mean when they say this it there is no arc storage for use between continuous games yes we all realize overflow goes into storage what is lame is you cannot see it you cannot hoard upgrades and high level items to take with you to your next continous game etc quit telling people there is storage when you know this is what they are referring to we all agree overproduction does not go into the void but no one cares
 no meaningful continuous game this is a huge hit for an anno game the game feels very scripted you start you choose one of three static maps in each of the three areas as the game progresses youre told to build things and shown exactly how much youre over or under producting you finish what feels like a long tutorial only to find out continuous game now means you can keep playing as long as you want but to do so feels very pointless starting another game means progressing through exact same long tutorual again
 weird fetchfacebook game mechanics required for collection of rare materials you have three options to collect rare materials in this game  materials which you do need for building modules fields etc on your farms now 1 combat zones 2 extremely bring and repetitive go to point a grab something and take it to point b quests 3 bejeweled app this is saddening when in anno 2070 advanced materials were created in a lab or academy etc yet another way the game has been dumbed down

in short the game was a massive disappoint to me and i have to imagine all long time anno fans i bought into the positive reviews refuting some of the claims made above and ultimately bought the game this was regrettable because this is not a 60 aaa game by any stretch of the imagination and is not an anno game i hope someday to be able to update this review with more positive feedback but at this point i am on the fence about sinking yet another 20 into dlc that probably should have been included in the game to begin with and probably will not buy it

heres hoping ubi fixes this game or releases new content for 2070 instead



#####

bluebyte lets make a awesome sequel to the amazing anno 2070

ubisoft great do it but lets remove all the horrible boring and hard citybuilding elements from the sequel so it wont be so hard to play the game for new gamers

bluebyte but the game is a citybuilder its supposed to work like a citybuilder where you can actually build stuff collect resources etc you know

ubisoft no remove all the stupid building and material mechanics its what makes nobody buy our games

bluebyte but its not going to be a citybuilder if you remove all the citybuilding elements

ubisoft whos your boss you want to lose your job remove all citybuilding elements from this citybuilder now

bluebyte sorry boss we will get the job done _____

to be continued next season lets shuv some freemium pay2win on top of this in a dlc and make the dlc mandatory download 



profit

#####

this game is far too easy and straight forward compared to the prequel anno 2070 which is one of my all time favourite games the whole game basically is a tutorial mission with little to no replayability i honeslty have no clue what the developers were thinking when making this game

lets take out multiplayer
lets take out interesting factions and deep charactars which you could interact with
lets take out micromanagment and literally anything challenging about this game
lets take out combat just too make it that much more easier i dont count that combat sector as combat  more of side quest
finally lets take out the unique bulding designs and add in possibly the most boring buildings youve ever seen literally just glass blocks nothing futuristic about that is there

sorry for the hate  ive been waiting for another anno for years and im just salty it was not what i expected if youre into easy games just for chilling then you will probably like this but if you crave somewhat of a challenge i wouldnt reccomend this game  its the easiest strategy game ive played in my life possibly 

#####

this review is from someone who played this series since anno 1602 including similar series as the caesar series pharaoh and emperor rise of the middle kingdom 

the main idea of these games is to manage a huge amount of features like coal and salt not only money meat and lumber and this game meets this requirement however i think the series is running the original theme while walking to a very futuristic aspect making it difficult to empathy and loses an interesting market gap that was left by sierra i liked the global map where the player can visit their colonies in different parts of the world practically in real time without a doubt this was a big step in the series

compared to other games in the anno series this seems to be more distant from the community of people  any city you create seems so cold and lifeless 

 anyway the game has an interesting proposal and seems to come to a line more sim city  cities skylines  war with a gerenciamente more complex a separate system of battles but definitely does not belong to the series anno games

forgiveness for english google translate

#####

its an ok buildingmanagement game but the worst out of the anno series it throws out many of the well known mechanics but doesnt add enough for depth or long term motivation

#####

its clear they reinvented the anno series instead of island you now have 3 sectors earth moon artic inside a sector all resources are available anywhere so you nolonger have to build simular buildings next to each other and while there are islands in the sectors you dont have to manage the trade route between them since resoureces are shared you still need trade routes between sectors

the big downside of this game is that combat you start with a harbor that has liked 10 turrets on it but you seen realise there is no threat in your regions noone else will come to fight you combat is not done in seperated mission but that are massively repeating sofar i only found two different missions

whether or not i would recommend this game is a hard decision for me but i did play it for 14 hours and thats is probally worth the value yeh after these 14 hours i dont feel like starting a new game as its to repeating

#####

brought this on steam sale with all dlc

totally worth it  
running a corporation has never been so satisfying  steering humanity to the moon and solving the worlds energy crises are the driving force of this game  the content offered is top notch  i resisted this game for a long time until all dlc were available  i had read lots of negative reviews regarding combat  combat is shit and totally ruined the game  if rts if your thing then look elsewhere  play this game with combat turned off under advanced settings when setting up your corperation  this lets you play city building and corporation evolvement unmolested  yes it can be fustrating but it is usually your fault and not the game mechanics  it s challanging in every way it can be and gives the playing a take on how corporations and not governments who will provide for humanity in the future  an eye opener for all you corporate haters out there  
graphic are second to none
sound great 
gameplay rewarding
replay moderate but you will get 150 hours out of this game
only real prob was no free form tools for city planning take note anno if you are making a city builder learn from city skylines  free form city building and more buildings and props are a must  yet the goals and achievements are fantastic
still playing and enjoying it after 60 hours on record
as it stands now a score of 910 is fair forget all the negative press it is a very good game

#####

this is not the anno game i used to play anymore

why  heres why

1 you like to manage productions on different islands with different fertility  there are none
2 you like to manage transportation from another island to your main island  nope at least not the same way
3 you like to discover build templates for production chains so they dont use to many spaces  i dont think so
4 you like to battle on the same map on which you manage your city  guess what no
5 you hope its the same serial of games you played before 170114042270  no way far worse

everything is so smooth and so easy done that you dont have to use your brain anymore at all
all the fun and the excitement is gone

if you have money buy it but before you do play at least the trial version because its not the same game anymore 

#####

40 hrs played
8510
the only thing i dont like about it is not making alot of side money from trade do to maintenance cost on trade routes

people are complaning about its to simplifiedwhen u have all the islands unlocked and over 20 trade routes it becomes more complex and having the same build cycle as anno 2070 would drive you mad having a system that is 100 accurate on how much a building is goin to produce and what it needs is alot better system then anno 2070 u can also add more to a buildings production decrease maintenance power workers transport as well

senorios are on the island its self each island has a major project to complete instead of just selecting a senorio from main menu

side quests are pretty genaric they give u money or rare resources to build building extras

this is a world city builder not just island city builder viewing it as such will take away from the experience

im quite happy with this purchase and await the dlcs to expand my citys even more  

#####

to be honest i really enjoyed the first couple of hours of gameplay  the visuals like usual were quite nice the game ran smoothly for me and it was overall quite pleasant  then i hit about 6 hours in and i unlocked the lunar base and was pumped  but it was just downhill from there  i had hoped with the greatly simplified ui if a bit perplexing at the start that the tediousness of the last anno would be fixed  wrongo  if anything with multiple settlements the micromanagement was intensified  the supply chains to me are useless  produce something at colony x send it to colony y and since colony y doesnt pay for it i get a net loss  so then to help offset the huge costs to start a lunar colony and the artic to a lesser extent i figured that if i shipped resources to the world market or whatever its called i could use that as a means to develop my colonies more  nope  even selling resources on the world market cost me to sell it  the only way i made a profit was to sell 1000 units of the item  completely stupid and baseless not to mention improbable  short of dumping a huge amount of time and effort to overdevelop my starting colony i couldnt make enough to make my lunar colony sustainable  which then made it impractical to send the resources i was producing back to earth which made my people mad which made me less money which made me shut off more things just sprials  

pros
the simplified ui does help in many regards more on this later as this is a cusory pro
introduction of a military into the game was a nice touch if not implemented all that well
interesting factions even if your relationship to them is fixed and therefore meaningless

cons
while hardly known at least recently for telling a story the campaign of the game is hollow and feels more like a checklist and less like a way for the game to get me involved
the factions are hollow are offer nothing to the game other than different people  you can only buy items from them but cannot sell   you could lump them all into the group of other with the remaining factions being us and them and you wouldnt miss a thing
military integration feels like an afterthought and like you are hired as a contractor to help with someone elses problems rather than managing the military aspect directly  
missions are bland and often are go here pick this up bring it back get resource rinse and repeat
feels more like you took the previous game reskinned it and made me pay for it again
no replay value in my limited opinion
the ui while it looks pretty is just strange  when tabbing between the different menus population types for instance i would expect to see only buildings unique to that population showing up  ie  the worker tab has worker buildings the exec tab has exec buildings etc  nope  when tabbing between the two which when you first get the second tier population you spend time looking around to figure out how to start building the tier 2 if you will buildings as it is not explained it seems the whole bottom row comes with it  after the first couple of times you figure out that those buildings are common buildings but the level of detail in the menus are just nonexistent or just not explained starting to see a trend
speaking of level of detail playing as a ceo of a multiplanet corporation one would think that details would be in abundance  i like games distant worlds for instance where there is an immense level of detail always a click away  if i want to know something i can find out but the game doesnt innudate me with detail otherwise  anno gives me little to no details on very important things  like on the lunar colony for instance i built a maintenance center and my income dropped for 17k to 9k  uh how  if this building is going to cost me 8k to maintain a little heads up would be nice  sure i want to know how much resource this thing is going to cost me but without mula resources which again cost more to sell than you get by selling them are useless
a little more about factions  the other companies are useless  they are more like obstacles between me and new regions rather than a competing factor  you could delete them from the game and miss nothing
this game fails to innovate in almost anyway  it is standard now for games of this type and supposed caliber to improve on old systems and to experiment a bit  we got the experimenting bit with adding new regions which is done well to be fair but all the old systems are just reskinned  public opinion seems like an after thought if you even pay attention to it decisions which are lets pick a company to vote for more on this in a moment are pretty much pointless the global market is broken i cant monopolize on having a fricken space elevator  apparently space elevators are only for this global companygovernment confused  so am i and security centers cost more to maintain seriously etc etc  just poorly implemented systems that have the exact same failings as the previous anno
decisions  i cant think of a reason why i would vote for these things  they seem to give no real benefit or it is so poorly implement and not explained period and so transparent and ineffectual that if you dont vote then who cares  plus i am voting for other companies  first of all why  why would i vote for another company  i mean seriously  second of all i am a major corporation why am i not included  why are they included  why why why why  oh and are votes a daily thing  weekly  ummmmm yeah idk  i just went back every once in a while and it was like and this was the outcome vote again  thanks but no thanks  i feel like there is a trend here
this game feels like everyone created their own systems and didnt talk to anyone else  just plain pointless  save your money

but all in all i have little playtime so i would take that into account when reading this  maybe things change as you play more but at 86 hours i feel no reason to go back to the game other than to watch my little company spiral out of control  

sarcasm fully intended

#####

im a great fan of the anno series but my recommendation is as follows

do not buy at this time  wait for a significant discount

pros
graphics are as always extremely beautiful

cons in order of impact from my perspective
  added later  my new worst con is that the epilepsy warning lasts literally 30 seconds and you cant escape out of it  you have to wait every time
  the change in battle mechanics is just too much for me  having a dedicated zone with no risk in your home sectors is no fun
  there is no sandbox game capability  its all campaign only
  you cant trade energy from map to map so i have 1000 energy in one map because its special project is actually energy generation and am starved in the next but cant utilize my surplus  edit  you end up being able to very deep in the advancement chain
  islands are in no way 5 times larger as was stated  they might be larger but the buildable space is actually pretty small
  zoom capability  you cant zoom out much and i feel too close to the map  
 controlnumber assignment doesnt work  you cant assign 1 to your command ship which is actually quite disrupting
 other comments have mentioned the change in logistics storage etc and i actually prefer the old way  everything seems too dumbed down to me and it potentially removes game play hours  i can see myself getting bored much more quickly since it already seems like a simplified and disappointing grind

my hope is these things will be addressed in patches or free updates but for now id wait if i were you

#####

alright i get asked alot if this game is good or worth it i got 30 hours into it so i can answer some questions when it goes on sale its worth it i purchased the game on sale for like 25 with all the dlc even for 50 with dlc i think its a good buy im an action and racing game player so a game like this is a bit out of my element but occasionally i like to kick back and play a simstrat game first off i have to say the graphics are 1010 they are crisp beautiful and detailed its a little cpu heavy versus graphics card heavy so just be aware of that 

the game itself i think is pretty great its hard to describe its not quite a city builder and not an rts its sorta inbetween you are a coportation your objective is to become number 1 you build roads and buildings to satisfy the needs of your goals on a particular map you need employees you build residents employees need food you need to build farms or food supplies you need factories to build things and in turn need workforce to run them its a nice little circle of needs on the easiest difficulty this is fairly easy to manage each map has different needs for different purposes and also different challenges you need more than one map in order to fullfill the primary objective in the game there are combat missions with a little fleet you are supplied you can avoid them for the most part if you dont want to play them but there are rare materials in the game that are not easily attainted and you are rewarded though combat missions as well as other tasks doing combat missions will allow you to complete military side objectives and be rewarded with these rare materials the rare materials are required to advance through the game alternatively when on a build map you get a cool little command unit to cruise around theres a port where rivals and npcs come and go they offer you little tasks and missions around the map to gain rare resources or other rewards sorta like minigames i usually do this when im just sitting idle waiting for a count down timer or resourses to level out each map has a story and a sort of side quest tasks you can do to unlock the maps benefits you are also limited by your level of progress which i think is great you have a credit cap that grows as your corporation grows as well as limitations on trading and etc meaning you have to grow in order to progress through the game

overall it took me about 30 hours to play to the most primary objective and there is much more afterwards the game keeps you busy but doesnt overwhelm you and isnt designed to make you fail the harder difficulties are considerably harder compared to the starting difficulty  and an added benefit is you can take your corporation that youve built and leveled into higher difficulties i think the game overall is very well designed and im pretty pleased with it to say the least there are some things i would change to make it more fluid or add some clarity on objectives and the tiphint function

70 for the ultimate edition is a bit of a stretch i think for a 3 year old game i think at 2030 with all the dlc on sale its a good buy id give it an 810 i got alot of playability out of it theres some thingsfunctions in the game that needed more clarity and the combat missions could use more variety

#####

this is my recent guilty pleasure game yes the game is shallow and mid to lategame is mostly a simple number equating algorithm that i can probably make a script to do in a minute and the ui is clunky and often unresponsive 

but somehow this is such a relaxing game for me that i have played so many hours so if you want a really relaxing and beautiful city builder this is the game for you if you are expecting lots of challenges this is not the game for you

#####

i feel like this game has a worse reputation than it deserves while the cons are large the game itself is not objectively bad the various sectors that you can go into while not random provided significantly more play time than a single play through in 2070 im at 25 hours as of this review and i havent even finished one game yet 

lacking multiplayer and random maps is the biggest problem with the game it strips a lot of what made 2070 what it was and why people liked it so much the combat in 2205 is kind of boring but i never found it all that great in 2070 either you longer make weapons or make ships and you dont do them in your sectors most of the time you are awarded ships and gain military experience to upgrade ships and thats really it its shallow and kind of boring but it can be avoided for most of the game

however the same annoying production lines still exist the perfect layouts still exist and most of the core gameplay from 2070 is still in 2205 as a city buildingeconomic game anno 2205 is wonderful as a direct successor to 2070 its lackluster the graphics and ui are absolutely stellar the different types of sectors are cool and the sector missions are fairly interesting ministories in themselves i wish theyd fleshed out the rival corporations a little bit more but the game presents its own challenges without it 

so id say if you really didnt care about combat in 2070 and you want a good single player game 2205 is a great addition to your library i was skeptical going in but im very glad i picked this game up

#####

i really do like this game this game really does remind me of all the different city building games out there
even though it is very hard sometimes however i do believe that the beautiful concept of the game does indeed completely betray the difficulty of the game
so yes all that being said i do highly recommend this particular game for any gamers out there anyone who may like this particular style of gaming

#####

though i said yes it is a cautious yes
positives
good great graphics
gentle learning curve
the moon
its easy might be bad

negatives
2070 was better
simplified
no combattrade
no sandbox mode i was looking forward to it the whole development
no replay value some maybe

so it is a yes but for a challenge or replay value of any kind just play anno 2070

#####

overall i dont understand the hate for this game compared to other anno versions  the trade is a bit dumbed down but you gain freedom of utilizing the space on your islands better  the space station is an interesting take on a tech tree and 4 regional zones give plenty of variety each map with its own quest lineunique perks  there are enough maps where i didnt miss the custom maps too much  the separate combat maps was also an interesting choice if you hate them you could do a few and ignore them  if you really love the combat well just run them and get resources  xp  

i would strongly recommend this game if youre open to changing the basic anno formula if youre looking for the same polished version in a different era you might stick to 1404 1700 2070 and possibly 1800 i havent played that yet only read reviews

i also have this on my ubi account and easily put 500 hours into 3 separate plays so full price ultimate edition was about 010hour not too bad  if youre on the fence wait til a sale but for anyone that loves caesar games anno games and others id say its worth it  if youre an anno purist skip it for 1800

#####

started out good loved the mechanics after the campaign theres just not much to do anymore you could certainly keep playing but there is nothing to do with the wealthpopulationtechnologynumberswhatever that you have amassed

#####

bought it on sale not worth it very simple compared to its predecessors you can walk away and leave the game running and nothing bad happens 

the core mechanic is to just plop buildings down on islands without restriction wherever you want no individual ships no complex trade routes just drop buildings then spend 15 minutes waiting for a project to complete so you can drop more buildings onto the map it does look very pretty though 

combat is in a separate arena to your cities the missions get repetitive very quickly you have the same small fleet each time no variance in mission quality sail in blow up a couple of other ships job done have some resources 
except you need those resources to build your city so you have to complete more boring combat missions to get the required rare goods to finish building projects on your islands 

buy anno 2070 instead or see what the reviews say about anno 1800 and save your cash for that

#####

i some how like it i like 2070 more tho but this is still nice and chill game im miss the random gen maps like in older versios but this one has own point 

i can recommend this game if you like the serie but in my opinion the older annos are a bit cooler 

#####

25 hours in building massive cities and hit the 6 digit negative somehow
the new anno is fun to play and more streamlined into a resource management game they got rid of some of the original concepts which was really good and replaced it with new ones the game however lacks a bit more substance to it as if this is just a base game for things to come with hopefully dlc or expansion to fix it up and create more depth to the game it is unfortunate that the core version did not offer much much more i do however recommend it as worth being played
some may love this game and some hardcore veterans of 2070 looking for more depth and  the same game will most likely hate it it has its good point but also letdowns hold off on it a bit for the dlcs to kick in unfortunately

h1prosh1
 the graphics in this is aesthetically pleasing great to watch the people and the day and night cycle which is optional and can be turned on bottom right
 sleak clean interface that is easy to learn and use
 music never fails to impress in the anno series
 open ended campaign system so that you can build and do whatever else you like
 modular buildings easy to buildmove buildings combat in seperate zone and strategized resource locations for some factories can be a hit or miss for some
 high density building content can prove a challenge you think its easy till you try to upgrade everything 
 multiple ways to earn rare resources t trading missionquests and combat
 build and manage cities in 3 different areas at the same time or focus on one from temperate climate artic and lunar still your choice on what you want to focus on
 alot of new features that fixes hectic hassles i had in 2070 the ability to move buildings is one so that i dont take down an entire area to build statues
 each areas of the world requires different strategy for settlement placement ie placing near factories to stay warm in the artics having to build under shield generators on moon to avoid space debris
 hopeful for additional content and release for the game to make it much better than it is which is a base game atm


h1 cons h1
 they took out alot of the management system from the original that added depth to the game
 not as much depth and content as i expected after reaching end game only thing to do is build high density and balance it out to work which is the challenge will be fun for a while there needs to be more challenges
 the combat system is arcadey and feels like it was just thrown in for the sake of it i am glad however that it is optional
 the rare resources are not so rare at all there are 3 ways to earn them and it is really easy too easy for rare
 needs more map randomization to add replayability
 multiplayer is gone unfortunately but sometimes that is a good thing
 needs more content

#####

its not anno as others in series its a business management simulator with production chains minor almost optional combat trading stock market and random gigs i like it main issues are thirdparty launcher thing that is mighty unstable and tediousness of few things but playing it easy is nice i enjoy mild base building and numbers going upvarious types of regions and no stupid plant x grows only on randomly selected islands which does not make any sense apart from game balance reasons

#####

ubisoft breaks the mold in quite a few ways with 2205 and unfortunately its not the best result

some things are decent
listthe shift to pertime production its a good idea overall but the stored amounts are burried too deeply and the inability to instantly sell excess and youll always either have just enough or be making excess like you could in previous anno games is a drag
the intrasector trading and dependence the game is much more one big living breathing creature than the scenarios of old this was clearly a big deal to ubi and i think they delivered it pretty well
some interesting mechanics that shake up the city building a bit  biggest of all being the alternate environments like the arctic where your factories provide heat in a radius that population buildings require also social services and the like arent really radius based anymore but quantity based which allows for some more freeform building which i approve of  the circular radius of influence was always a bit unrealistic
list

however at this point shortly after launch the negatives outweigh the positives earning this a thumbs down
listoversimplification of goods storage you can see how much you have stored by hovering over the goods display but theres really not much point to it when youre not able to sell it and theres no real need to move it around other than in an overtime basis
this ones a real killer for me the population system is terrible gone is the old tax rate system which admittedly was a bit gamey and instead the supported population and tax paid goes up as you fulfill needs but heres the killer unlike previous where you could see how many rights to the next tier and how full overall you were theres no display for that you can get a total population display but thats useless i want to know how many t1 i have of the current max how many of those i can upgrade to t2 etc but that seems to be utterly missing for an anno game this is a cardinal sin and completely unacceptable this is fixable however and i can only hope that ubi will hear the pleas on this
the second major flaw is the combat i could live with it being offshored to special conflict areas if it was engaging and interesting but instead its like a minigame that just eats up time you have basically no choice in the units other than to upgrade what you have in a linear path and far as i can tell once youve lost a ship on a particular mission its gone until youre done and then its just back again the shame of it is i doubt theres much hope of this changing since the core mechanic of it in 2205 is so drastically locked away compared to previous versions
list

im a pretty diehard anno fan and i sincerely hope future patches will be enough to switch my review to a yes but as it is now unless you just about bleed anno 2205 is a pass

#####

this review is written without any knowledge about the other anno parts

i really recommened this game to play if you like city builders or rtsgames

 its able to let you spend a lot of time in its worlddue to its large amount of possibilities and maps you can spend a lot of time in this game building large cities and farm ressources the story leads you step by step through the game by giving missions that helps you to learn all features of the game 

one problem in this game is that you have to get connected to the internet to access all features of the game there are also too less military missions included in this game

although this points can take some of the fun when playing this game it is definitely worth his money



#####

anno 2205 what can i say you really didnt advance much with this version this is extremly similar to one of its past titles anno 2070 which is far better than whatever this is but okay dont get me wrong the game isnt entirely awful for the first 15 hours it is visually stunning and just pure amazement then afterwards it just becomes the same old repeat of content there is nothing new to the game considering that it has 4 maps for the base continent and 3 for the other two which unlike there last game is not randomley generated and offers no content

cons
trade routes require to be changed each time you advance more people
loading times are too much between traveling back and forth between the artic green and the moon
lots of content lies behind dlc
not much content in base game
30 hours max of play time

pros
looks good
city builder

for the games current price it is no where near worth the amount of time you recieve out of it if you are looking for a real campaign that is interesting so to speak and challenging modes then i would get anno 2070 which is a far better game than this

#####

i wanted to like anno 2205  but just couldnt
id played the other anno titles some time ago and enjoyed them mostly so i thought id get some similar enjoyment out of this latest iteration 
basically i found it boring and scrappy 
the achievements in each zone were unfulfilling much of which consisted of tediously waiting for your little ship to go from one side of the map to the other to click something or else increasing your population  
building up the city too wasnt very interesting either you add some more homes and then add some more support buildings to match thats pretty much it and its as dull as it sounds 
the trading between the temperate arctic and lunar zones just extended this mechanic by adding somewhere else you needed to buildup after you have increased the population in one of the other zones 
to be honest im still not sure what the ship battle side missions are for they are such a disjoint from the rest of the gameplay and are very samey i think you can just ignore them if you wish and once you have done one then you probably will 
though a pretty looking game after looking at some animation once you will zoom out and not be interested again as it tells you nothing similarly with the little voice clips that play each time a home is selected just an annoying distraction after hearing it the first time 
the mechanism of the stock market available later in the game is annoying and seemingly pointless and id recommend not turning it on when it becomes available in the game 
halfway through i found myself having to grit my teeth and get on with grinding towards a game end not a happy situation with an expensive game       
i came away with the impression that this was a game built by a team that didnt communicate much with each feature bolted together loosely at the end of development 
except for diehard fans id say this franchise has run its course

#####

i bought this game looking for a futuristic city builder

i played for 13 hours straight on my first session
thats how good this game is

i was getting warnings for playing for so long literally the narrator in the game had pop ups that told me to chill after 10 hours of straight playing


this is one of the best most relaxing theraputic game youll find if you like frostpunktropico and simcity  this is all of them combined and even better id say

#####

2205 is a lot different than 2070  they have basically removed a lot of the tedium from 2070 but some of that tedium was good substance too  i loved setting up shipstrade routes to move goods on individual maps i thought that was ridiculously immersive  i do miss that

the game is quick to play and learn and drop in to  sometimes it does feel simplistic but sometimes simplistic is nice too  i wouldnt judge this against 2070 2070 is a better resource management game  a better production game  2205 is fun too though  in its own right its got a lot going for it  its beautiful for one it runs great  i love playing on the moon  im enjoying developing every island and achievement hunting  also setting up profitable trade deals is quite fun and easy to get going as is the stock marketcorp system  im still trying to wrap my head around orbit but i think ive got a decent handle it on it not my most favorite minigame though

some things i would have liked to have seen in the game include
list
a decent tutorial system
manually set up trade routes between individual island warehouses on the same map 2070 style
some more variety in the quests youre given
more customization over your combat units and more variedinteresting combat  i do miss the defense building and ships from 2070
orbit could have used a nice little tutorial system and more impactful structures  i feel also that overall out of all the dlc orbit is missing a lot of the detail and shine of the other content in the game  it feels a little rushed and flat
list

some things i really love
list
the graphics
the absolute sheer unbridled amount of detail packed into literally everything its amazing guys great job
the moonscape is perfect
the combat is fast paced and visceral  explosions everywhere
one faction to play for each climate type  this was one of my most annoyed at things in the previous and especially 2070 anno games  
the individual factions being in different climates really makes sense and helps the game not feel bogged down with a multitude of buildings
the ease of placing public structures not a huge number you have to cluster your houses around
being able to move strctures after youve constructed them yay for the future

get it while its on sale for sure its a steal  full price is a bit much imo which is why i waited for the sale

#####

dead game already  cant login because uplay offline 

#####

picked this up two days ago having enjoyed cities skylines but looking for something that offers a little more sure the citybuilding isnt as detailed at all but theres definately fun to be here with all the other aspects of the game dont be scared away by the negative reviews i was at first now i logged 12 hours already

#####

very additive and fun  story is good  if you like resource management with a little combat then this game is for you

#####

it covers all the basics its a city sim with rts battles against a group of lunatic terrorists anno 2205 is easy to pick up and just challenging enough to keep you coming back a rare gem

#####

one of the most well produced futuristic building games in existence a lot to experience about a realistic science fiction world not terribly far in the future from us

if you just chill your multifarious expectations from the anno series play on easy and ignore the annoying ubisoft platform then youll see how much beauty there is in this game

if you are looking for some competitive wellbalanced game with good ai opponents very much in the vein of anno and dont care a ton about the theme then you can skip it since theres many other anno games you can play instead

#####

save your money and buy the older anno 2070its the same game but with less gameplay for more money

#####

season pass is pointless they still want you to purchase dlcs

#####

this is going to be a bit of a two part review ill start with the negatives and end up telling you why i actually recommend this game

anno 1602 was my first pc game ever in christmas 1998 we received our first computer a compaq pressario and anno 1602 came with it this franchise remained close to my heart even though i only played 2070 and 2205

lets start right out of the bat with whats wrong about this game

1 it uses uplay uplay has always been gimmicky and a bad substitute for steam integration rewards are meaningless separate friend list for me the game worked on the second try though it worked without problem the first time it failed to register the game ever since the game has worked flawlessly and there isnt one of those annoying uplay launcher that came with previous games but as always thats my experience and your milleage will vary its not the worst uplay integration ive seen and thats not saying much i hope one day corporate will finally give up on uplay and trying to be steam but until that day its there its a shitty drm

2 no multiplayer i dont have much to say about this as i maybe played anno in multiplayer twice

3 worlds arent randomly generated thus lack replayability now thats true but ill go out and bat as to why this isnt a bad thing for each biome except dlc you got 3 fixed maps now if you remember your anno while maps were randomly generated they were more or less always the same assortment in anno 2070 there were big islands small islands starting islands had tea coffee and rice your second island would have vegetable etc it was the same map every time except the tile would be randomized this time each map are custom made they are unique and in my opinion well crafted i think you get more replayability by having an assortment of 3 custom map than just by having the same map regenerated but thats just me

4 theres no free play its all mission yeah i cant argue with you here although the missions are more or less light and are simply what you would do anyway and if you dont like the combat missions you can skip them altogether and just wait it out

5 combat is relegated as its own separate minigame yeah its gimmicky but it was ok fun for me not great not bad the combat in anno has never been a strong suit of the franchise and the combat in 2070 felt painstaking to me im not going to regret not having to fight during my regular base building game

6 not mentioned anywhere else you play alone you rarely ever interact with any other faction or player its sad but its true i miss raging at when the ai just take the one island i wanted

7 always online bullshit here youre connected to a global market i assume its the game drm so to speak to force people to play online but if sim city back pedalled and removed it and allowed you to play offline so can you

now that im done with that heres why as a long time anno fan i love this game
1 they got rid of the area of control silliness now theres still some area of controls in this game but now it make sense on temperate island why would you ever have problems building somewhere  it doesnt make sense and its not in this game here sorry if it spoil the gameplay

in the arctic biome your factories generate heats and houses need heat in order to be habitable ok that make sense 

on the moon there are asteroid strikes and radiation therefor you need to be under a shield to protect your employee from radiation that make sense  

on the temperate or tundra biome you need to have haha im just kidding you see it  you can connect back to the wherehouse with it  you can build it gone are the days you needed depots markets and city centers

2 i love the biomes i love the restrictions they put in them they felt much more varried than the this island can grow wheat this island cant this island has gold this one doesnt the gameplay on each place is much more varried much more fresh instead of factions you have biomes what you had with eden and global trust you now have 3 different gameplay style for each place 3 different layouts style 3 different tech tree and you get to experience it all in one game

yeah my list of positive right now is much shorter than my list of criticism but it overshadow one part that cant really be conveyed by a review i had a blast i loved this game much more than i did anno 2070 i bought it at half price and already spent 14 hours inside it thats like 2 an hour i got my moneys worth and im still looking forward to play more of it im sure ill tire of it eventually but its not the case yet now if you excuse me i got an hydrodam to rebuild and a space hotel to restore

see ya

#####

if you look at anno 2205 as its own game without comparing it to its heydays its still a fun game and is probably worth maybe 20 if all the dlc was included but compared to dawn of discoveryanno 1404 its a pretty lifeless tedious and unchallenging game to play  

in regards to the lifeless comments its has a much more series art style and lacks the colorfulness of anno 1404 and all the characters are really annoying in comparison to anno 1404

in regards to the tedious comment ubisoft has done the stupid ubisoft thing and made doing stupid quest stupid and no fun  i mean seriously how many maintain 100000 surplus of x goods quest are needed  how many quests are there that require me to build some stupid building for ten minutes only for me to bulldoze it when the quest is done  and then lets talking about the stupid ai that goes nuts when a needed good isnt fulfilled and bothers u every 5 min about it and if you have many goods unfulfilled he wont shut up  and then there is the stock market game omg if u turn it on prepare to be bothered by competitors trying to buy your company right out from under u every gd minute its not like its hard to beat the stock market but because biding can take minutes u cant do pretty much anything else except stock market crap until you own all your competitors stocks and then every now and then there are these dumb calamites that happen that can shut entire sectors down for 30m if u dont do the stupid response quest  and some of the calamites lock u into really annoying environmental effects for the duration like there is this one calamity where a hack steals some of your money but then your screen gets all blurry and nonevsyncy and it causes headaches and epileptic reactions

and then in regards to no challenge  they took away trade routes  i mean u cant build ships any more and set up routes from island to island now each map shares its warehouse goods and then you set up boring lines on a map trade routes that are stupid easy to maintain and suck all the joy out of the game  also they made placing factories and farms stupid easy by making it so that expansion dont have to touch the original structure but instead only have to touch an expansion so you dont have to think about interesting or creative layouts anymore  also service buildings dont have a radius so just plop those builds down wherever u like

on a plus side it is a major improvement that they actually give u a report that shows your net productionconsumption numbers so u dont have to use a third party web app but thats pretty much the only improvement to the series everything is a step backwards

but seriously shut that damn ai up

#####

i like it  i bought the anno 2205 ultimate edition with all dlc content for just 1249 on sale so i dont know how to judge just the base game  ive never played an anno game before either but it stands out as different from other games i have  the city building is interesting in how you maintain different sectors and setup trade routes between them sort of like building seperate cities entirely  there is also an added rts minigame element of sorts in conducting missions with your ships  these are made much more fun by the weapon systems you find such as nuclear missle barrage etc  the arctic was challenging to keep everyone warm and the biggest mistake i made was building too many of the same building vs building addon modules for the first building to increase production decrease energy needs etc  it is likely true that the game overall is nothing too complex but i have plenty more complex city builders and such  when you eventually build an orbital station you can begin to unlock a tech tree  this game is also quite beautiful to look at  i do think the game is worth more than i paid for it  although i have limited time with it as of this review i think i would still have been happy if it were 25 including all dlc  this game also increases my interest in the newest anno 1800 game that will be out soon

#####

i got this on sale and honestly its still not worth the money its a very dull numberbalancing game that sucks the fun out of citybuilding and replaces it with well nothing really 

it is very safe to skip this one youre not missing anything

#####

i dont often write reviews however since this game has been getting a lot of flak from the diehard anno fans let me give you my opinion as someone not so rooted into the games history
i played a fair share of anno 2070 so ill base my comparison on that although they have removed several elements from the previous game the new features i feel make up for it rather well the estetic is gorgeous the soundtrack even more so and i think this is one of the few games ive played where i couldnt find a single bug on release im sure someone from the old games will quickly flood in here foaming at the mouth but honestly im enjoying this game thus far and likely will get a few hundred hours out of it before i feel like taking a break
its up to you if you want to put the money into it you can always wait for a sale but i highly recommend it

#####

want a good anno then buy anno 2070
also new dlc not in the season pass

no more money to cancer ubisoft


#####

not what ive expected  not worth the 5999  but the graphics and details are very well donethough if you want to have a challengetry out anno 2070 and dawn of discovery these two games are very fun and amusing

#####

im thankful i listened to the recent reviews over the more popular ones i think the game is stunning i particularly love how clean and refined it feels

910

its really too bad that drm ruined such an awesome game

this is a really great game wrapped inside a horrendous shell at the moment after playing 46 hours im stuck in some sort of drm hell where i just get errors no matter what i do

i dont understand why ubisoft makes it such a hassle to play their games eventually i will learn to not get suckered into paying them money just because a game is really fun to play

uplay can take a hike annoying app to have to install when steam already installed

this is not anno this is a weak simcity clone

the classic anno games were much more than this they were a blend of simcity and rts concepts  they had limited but interesting multiplayer  they had plenty of replayability with its procedurally generated levels

this game removed all of that and just made it essentially a campaign only with no actual multiplayer  multiplayer may have not been the greatest feature of the game but playing cooperatively with friends was some of the best enjoyments i got out of the classic anno games  this was one of the biggest disappointments i have ever had the misfortune of preordering i went from having the highest customer loyalty in this developer to completely regretting my purchase 100

this game has taught me to never preorder anything ever again im done with preorder culture and will now wait to see if any game is worth purchasing before i purchase it

to any of those who are interested in the anno series completely skip this title and go try out anno 2070 or dawn of discovery gold also known as anno 1404 gold they are much better games than this and show what anno is supposed to be and why it is unique  this however is just your typical simcity ripoff attempting to cash in on its somewhat impressive graphics and extreme lack of depth  you will find better simcity style games out there  and the combat was completely removed from the main game and made into an instanced minigame simply meant to act as a distraction to the incredibly uninteresting city building aspect  it went from a hybrid to a packaged game with 2 watered down versions of itself

my only hope is that the devs understand that there are still fans out there who care about what made the classic anno games great  im still waiting for an actual sequel to anno 2070 this however was nothing more than an imposter  i hope they use the money i spent on it to correct their mistake for the future

a good choice to play during quarantine

for an opening statement  never played any other anno game so i dont have that kind of luggage

this game is a better surviving mars in my opinion pretty casual relaxing not that many production chains but still enjoyable due to different environments the maps are few but enough at least in the full game aka the ultimate edition there are 4 difficulty settings but i would recommend jumping into veteran asap while theres a lot to do the game isnt that replayable or rather  its a waste of time to start over so yes stick to the veteran difficulty and dont look back 

uplay is a bit offputting but there are uplay free versions out there in the web if you know what i mean hue hue 

regardless bought this on sale for 1249 and no regrets highly recommended

#####

the reason i enjoyed dawn of discovery was because of a deep technology chain and the ability to play in sandbox mode this version of anno like 2070 seems to focus on story so much that you cant actually enjoy the strategy aspects of the game

#####

been playing this since day 1  although not exactly the same mechanics as previous titles it does a good job of allowing to move between different climates and even into space the dlc was been a little disappointing but not the worst and didnt provide much new content but was still a welcome addition 

if your into more the city building side then this game is for you but if you are more into battling its there but you may be a little dissapointed  

i was pretty upset when they didnt include the last dlc as part of the season pass originally but the developers listened and even aggreed with the community so i will recommend this game for sure 710

#####

i never played an anno game before until today and i like it

its just fun to play next thing i know the afternoon went by and i missed it not too many games can make that happen to me anymore

#####

quick and honest review

eperiences i played thousens of hours of the previous anno and still play them sometimes and enjoy it more than this new adition to the serie

opinion      i was waiting for a new anno for a long time i never been that dissapointed except for the new star wars movie when he put out his mask

overall

story                810 the story is better you will have many side quest relited to last games you start your own new megacorp its imersive and fun at first
gameplay        510  the first playtrough is very fun the graphics are amazing but beware it is nothing as addicitve as the other anno starting a new corp get very repetitive even at a higher dificulty you have a set of island that will always stay the same and every time you start a new game  you will likely do the same strategy over and over again the new dlc only add new sector with a 2 tier workers 
multiplayer      none

final socre             410 not a bad city builder game but a huge step back from previous anno titles

#####

this game has a fun economy and very nice and smooth visuals its incredibly aesthetically pleasing as well as a fun to balance and build a functioning world each region has unique challenges and enjoyable landscapes

#####

i got my moneys worth out of it lots to do see build and try before it reaches repetitive stage
