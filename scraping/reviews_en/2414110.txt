game felt kinda basic at first and then i noticed in the other discussions this game is a paid version of a free mobile game of the same name and to be honest it really shows

my biggest issue is the ui is pretty obviously touch screen based so building is hella awkward even with rebound keys there is no hotbar there are very few sound effects apart from placing objects and a research finishing and if im not mistaken there is a single song that just plays on repeat there are also decorations but they just feel out of place random crates or cones you can place here and there no foundations to make the ground uniform

honestly was excited for this and am kinda let down  25 usd is definetely a bit much considering you just get the avanced settings that only cost 20 on the free mobile version will keep this in my wishlist and hope for some updates as these problems were pretty apparent in the first hour

#####

i try never to write a negative review but i feel i should  let people know this game is waaaaaaaaay too expensive  refunded   its would be okay for about 7  i would have kept it and played it every now and then but 1898 for this  is robbery

#####

yeah yeah naw if you are looking for a factory game this isnt the one for you it is wayyyy too simple as it stands right now has no right being 22 dollars on sale
if you have ever played the game shapez its even more simple than that with less satisfaction less challenge an 6x the price wait for a better sale i assume i will pretty much finish it in under 10 hours try finishing satisfactory in 10 hours ha

sorry devs your heart is in the right place but needs some more love more challenge more sense of accomplishment while playing

#####

its a very simple game could be worth a good few hours of play time but the price is just not justified i would not recommend it unless its on 50 special

#####

 tldr the price is extremely high when you compare it to its competition factorio for example costs only 50 extra for ten times the content not including mods however as a simple factory game it definitely does the job even if ui needs a bit of work would be great for new players to the genre but its a heavy price to pay to try a new thing with less content than the competition so far ive seen no bugs on pc so its a much better launch than blizzard or bethesda can ever do hope for xd

i think thats a great introduction to the factory genre but there are definitely a few things to change so the port to pc feels right the style is nice not having a body is refreshing balance seems alright there are blueprints copy paste you can rotate built belts and splitters which is great its a more simple than other games in the genre so it would likely be less intimidating for new players

that being said the ui needs a bit of work so it doesnt feel like my pc is trying to be an ipad the icons in the buildings tab are way too big and it would be great if tooltips showed info about the buildings like recipes and speed and such instead of just the building and tier seeing the speed on belt tooltip would be good too

#####

not worth the money tbh its got potential but a price tag 15th of what i paid would have been more reasonable for what you get

its port of a phone game but seems to have less features missing quality of life such as a toolbar controls are bit clunky production stats only show when looking at a single building these problems feel like its because its a phone game that hasnt been modified for pc where theres more scope

depth of gameplay and complexity isnt really there in my opinion especially considering for the price you could get something like dyson sphere program

#####

its an okay game if you already played through factory town and shapez this might be worth a look both games are in their own right overall better than builderment though so play those first if you havent all in all
 smooth graphics relaxing music
 overall chill and satisfying building game

 lacks some quality of life features there are blueprints but there is no copying recipies or a quickbutton to upgrade buildingsyou have to open every single building to upgrade it super annoying
 after the inital start you dont unlock that many cool buildings anymore its just rinse and repeat
 the conveyor beltbuilding simply felt better in games like factorio or shapez the belts often dont snap the way i want them too
price somewhat steep for the content its more like a 15 game

#####

i dont typically review but i have to for this one 

i cannot recommend this game at this state for this price  within my 2 hour limit i had almost unlocked all of the technology the game has potential but for 25 its just not worth it 

game play wise though it reminds me of shapezio but with better graphics

#####

too simple of a game for this price would be worth 5 or 10 maybe

#####

not worth 20 bucks

#####

i was really looking forward to how this game would play out but honestly i feel as though the price point for what you receive is quite a bit off the ui needs work for pc and the belts feel restrained for what their posted speeds are trying to manage ratios is also very difficult with the way things are setup if anything id suggest wait for a while so the devs can fix the bugspoor design elements or see if this game is actually going anywhere

#####

this game is the equivalent of seeing a hot dog stand selling hot dogs for 40 each curiosity compels you to get one to see why its so expensive

you end up enjoying the hot dog but then also you realize your curiosity is just a desire for schadenfreude except the subject of schadenfreude is yourself for spending 40 on a hotdog

jokes aside solid game complexity ramps up later on the other impressions that its a factory game with production lines but with shapez ease of buildingexpanding are spot on

not sure why id ever want to build storage or inserters and the power systems usage is pretty much confined to getting more ore out of extractors but otherwise its got a nice complexity scaling curve overall

still not worth 25 though in my honest opinion

#####

this game is just as fantastic as the tablet version i was so skeptical of buying it with all the negative reviews but i decided to take a gamble and it is great controls are great and plays the same as the tablet some people complained that there wasnt a hotbar like satisfactory but to me its not a big deal super fun game would highly recommend to anyone that likes factory automation games i do hope the developer adds in some equipment like they have before like some sort of smart splitter i know that the robotic arms basically do that with the filter but it takes up a lot of room so a smart splitter would be a really cool addition

#####

great game kinda it really good to have open while doing other stuff and organizing the factory lines to get stuff moving efficiently is awesome definitely not better than factorio but then again this game isnt really comparable to that game because of how simple and easy to understand this game is really should be way cheaper though and it would be neat if it would sync with your mobile version of the game that way you can continue playing wherever

#####

indeed it doesnt really invent anything new and it is pretty expensive and yes factorio shapez and factory town all are in one or another way better

nevertheless its a solid game way better than the 44 its currently on so ill give it a thumbs up instead of the neutral no comment  no vote i would usually give when i think its ok

#####

nice low stress resource harvest and building game was fun for my one play through this took 46 hours no difficulty levels or other in game reason to play it again

#####

there is not much too this game  take factorio and dumb it down almost to nothing but the basic automation and you have builderment  make things until you unlock more things and make them as well  you wont run out of resources so its a bit more relaxing than something like factorio but at the same time i feel less rewarded by getting things made and expanding out seems more of a hassle  

i also think for the content its a bit over priced  there is nothing here you cant get from the well established factory games and there are even bare bones simple ones that are a better option than this

#####

its a nice chill factory builder

#####

in short nice game clunky interface

the game really needs more qol like a pipette tool and a hotbar
for the devs a lot of your players will also play factorio perhaps see which qol stuff you can add a way to deselect your mouse without having to move your hand to esc or a build way without having to move to the spacebar a better copy function and so on making the controls more intuitive and easier to use would make the game more enjoyable

oh yeh and also trains 

#####

this game has all the scaling functions that you would expect of a factory game but the compelling gameplay is not there i would judge this game to be worth 5 in its current state and would recommend it to those that like games like factorio shapesio etc

#####

do not buy this game its a ripoff that seems to be not getting updated 



#####

i just got the game and have only been on it for like 15 minutes but i havent even been able to play it i spent the entire time in the menu trying to figure out how to do anything none of the buttons will work no matter how long i wait or how long i try and it seems really laggy i am going to just try some more later and fix my review accordingly but so far its a waste of money

#####

its good it is a bit laggy and it uses 100 of my cpu but other than that its a good game

#####

pretty good if you are bored simple but complex you can play in many ways a bit like factorio i can say is a good game when you are bored and want just to try something new

#####

not a ton of depth but it is ok i suppose i would say if you want a chillax beltathon giver er a buy

#####

great game but no more updates after launch

#####

one of my favorite game on iphone 100h of game time there and i am so glad to see it come to pc dont get fooled by its simplicity you can spend dozens hundreds of hours trying to optimised your builds to get the most of each ores in the entire world

#####

absolute garbage
i thought this would be more like factorio
dont buy this

#####

love it and would love to see an expansion

#####

great game

#####

this game has potential but is filled with bugs on mac lacks content for the price

#####

yes very good


#####



#####

i love this game any game like satisfondryactoryioshapez ok any factory game i love it

#####

balls

#####

g

#####

fun little builder game starts super easy and really does not get hard

#####

if your into simple management games and dont mind there to be no lore or sotry what so ever no updates or new content and a step price then this is the game for you

while i like the simple management game i dont see a reason for the heavy price when the exact same game is free on mobile especially since theres no new content or updates what so ever which is the reason i can not recommend it

#####

i mean its ok need some more content

#####

i get the comments about price and the interface but if youre alright with the price id recommend it  some of the quirks relating to the interface are noticeable at first but after a while you just get used to it  

its not as slick as shapezio and im not sure how long the appeal lasts once you get to the end shapezio obviously goes on forever but if you like that game you should get on with this





#####

yes but its a bit pricey for what it is i got this to scratch the itch while waiting for the factorio update it kinda does definitely something to play in say 1hr chunks not blitz

id really like to know ifwhen any primary or intermediate products are no longer required to advance the tech tree and can be purely sold or  just abandoned
