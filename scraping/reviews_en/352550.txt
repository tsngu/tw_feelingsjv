222 edit the image of this game sums it up see all these buildings thats what cities skylines has as for me ehh hes doing some sort of given up expression it sums up my thoughts on this game entirely

man where do i even begin with this game

i wanted to love it so much after watching youtube videos and playthroughs this game looked amazing after watching several hours of them sadly i dont think ive ever been burned as hard as i have been with this game more than any other game ive ever preordered in my entire life including spore yes including spore  ive tried to give this game some breaks but

lets bulletpoint this

1 any resolution other than your native monitor resolution and the game will dull the colors immensely also forget trying to play this game at anything above 1080p because youll get graphical errors that make all of your buildings white and blue also kiss any framerate stability out the window despite owning a gtx 1080 its been three weeks since release and no fix unexcuseable

2 you feel like you have no control over anything that everything you do doesnt matter and by the end you stop caring you can see theres this whole economy ticking behind your industries and businessess but you cant decide to help paper or barbershops directly or anything of the sort you just place huge districts down and hope things work out city council edicts are just passive boosts to your entire city that you just idly click on to make things easier

3 i really must stress the lack of control what does heavy traffic do to harm your city dont know because unlike cities skylines it just gives you vague maximum traffic usage numbers how does it damage my economy what can i do to make lumber or movies a better industry in my town no idea a lot of the time youre just waiting months to do minor adjustments to districts for boredoms sake

4 your city looks boring as heck roads all grids industries i guess film industries car factories and lumber mills all look the same and i just didnt know about it dont you remember when film studios had smoke stacks i sure dont so forget having any major control on how your city looks or putting it on a hill or anything of the sort its just flat land remember germany being flat guess were in the netherlands now

you know i could go on and on and on about how the music repeats every ten minutes how you really have to zoom in on max settings to even see people walk about how despite the cool as heck technology tree is broken because you can be 30 40 50 years ahead of modern tech if you abuse it this game made me not care about my city what i was doing and why i was doing it thats the nail in the coffin for any simulator i just dont see anything they could do to fix this game its just not fun and it depresses me saying that 

i wouldnt recommend this game even if it went on sale from 40 dollars to 5 dollars it just feels like some major spark is missing cities skylines absolutely destroys this game and still stands as the best city builder to date go get that and like two hundred mods and watch a day pass by oh and they arent even sure this game will get modshop support now heck tropico 5 is still an excellent choice for those who want something more local and flavorful to me i should have bought the new skyrim instead of this this is literally the biggest disappoint in gaming in years to me i wanted to love this game but i cant the concept screamed epic the execution souless

updated this review 21417 since a lot of you liked it apperently

h1bnot quite there yetbh1

i love city building games  i love politics  i should love urban empire

urban empire starts wonderfully exciting  to start it has open territory to place your districts a council to influence and support from the emperor to get you going  the game remains fun while you create and grow your first couple of districts and through the entire first era  as the game goes on each era becomes more and more repetitive and the errors in and problems with the game become more apparent

based on price and experience for now i have to give this game a thumbs down  however it is my sincerest hope that mods and patching will really improve both the primary experience and the replayability of urban empire  i want to love the game and i think i can if they take a good hard look at what city building combined with politicking can fully offer

h1what i likeh1
1  the premise of growing a city through political wrangling

2  the option of the families though i wish there were a few more of them from which to choose

3  the politicking of the council and the parties

h1what i dont likeh1
1  decision tool tips
list
in many cases there arent any tool tips
when there are tool tips i dont need the game to say if you click here you will get a 5 bonus to x  i dont like static numbers in a game thats supposed to be based on humans and politics however there should be a tool tip that states if you select this option you should see a small boost to your economy
additional note  after which you may see a 1 to 5 modifier to whatever  put some smallsubtle human naturefailure randomizing to personalize it more  we already have failed assassination attempts why cant we have false math aka spin 
list

2  fluffstorybased decisions out or order  notional example but consistent with the point
list
1850  your baby is born with a disease what do you do
1855  daddy tells you to get married
1857  you get married
1860  you have no children and this worries the city
1861  you have your first child
list

3  replayability is lacking  in my experience
list
progressive agenda issue for the era proposed multiple times even if vote fails or overruled  conservative policies for the era are oneanddone  this makes it very difficult to play the von pflizen family true to their lore  both the council and the populous should be a bit more randomized every play though  maybe one time i play and the city leans toward liberal policies and the next time they are more puritanically religious and conservative  this would allow for more replayability  
all families should be able to win based on their ideals  populist or liberal western ideals shouldnt be the only path to victory  if i want to run the city as a facist communist republicantory democratlabour green pacifist libertarian anarchist theocracy or whatever i should be able to  when i played as me the game was basically on easy mode  when i tried to play a role i barely got past era iii each time and always failed in era iv
i am not accusing the developers of having a political bias but my experience is that populism and generally liberal policies make for a well functioning city  its a selfimposed hardmode to play any other way 
list

4  lots of lag at endgame
list
whether its on the city map or even in the city council starting in era iv the game becomes very very laggy  theres no point in even moving the camera over my city unless fully paused and waiting 35 seconds for a button click to register is not ideal
list

5  bad spelling grammar
list
im not too worried about this and im by no means perfect but it should be noted that they could use a better english editor to fix the numerous spelling and grammar errors
list

boring

this is a boring game which feels like youre pulling 34 levers every few minutes to see what happens  

as background i like and enjoy complicated strategy games  some of my favourites are the crusader kings and europa universalis series  i also have sunk many hours into the political and dynasty aspects of the guild series  i like these types of games  i saw a preview and was excited at the idea of a mayor simulation with some background politics and influencing political parties  sounds like a fantastic idea for a game

this game is none of that

1  youll see a lot of negative reviews with respect to the town planning  i can appreciate that it is not a city builder  it wasnt meant to be however town councils county councils etc have planning offices and engage in town planning  this is nothing like that  its very basic akin to what youd find on a mobile phone app  

you select a district and you can only use  to determine whether its industry business or residential you dont select where the individual neighbourhoods are  so which blocks in your district are i b or r is really up to the game and not you  this is a weird design choice  

you put some important buildings eventually like police station or courthouse and you can wire it up for gas or sewers for example but this is mostly done by just clicking a tick and hoping the council agrees with you  its very basic and not at all enjoyable to watch your city grow because youve had little to do with it  this is the opposite experience of the town planning aspect of banished for example which is rather fun to watch the town grow

2 you dont create your family  yes this was discussed in the previews so this is only a minor criticism  yes they said it was prescripted  its worth noting though that when they say prescripted they mean it  it has socalled 1000 dynamic events but none of this really seemed like it couldnt have been done without creating your own family and style  ck does it  anyway doesnt matter just poorly thought out in my opinion

the families you choose are typical tropes  so you have the villainous and cruel aristrocat party which of course has von in the name  youve some weird stageirish sounding name and thats the family thats all into working class and unions  youve the mysterious russians and then youve a family thats all about science  how many science dynasties have you read about  anyway its just trope and as bad as it sounds the specifics of the families as in how stereotypical they were actually going to be was not in the promos  its worse than anything youve read  i find this to be an immersian killer your opinion may vary

3  the political parties in this fictional town are irritating and seemingly pointless  yes they sit on the spectrum of conservativeliberal and rightleft and some mishmash inbetween  they have histories that you wont care about  they are name  you wont interact with any party leader for example as everything is abstract  

most of your interactions will be with three buttons  pleaddemandthreaten  thats it  you click one and then a dialogue menu comes up  once you click one even if you dont like the dialogue thats tough  you have to make a choice of the options which is 12 13 or sometimes 14  what the options do seems to be an arbitrary mystery  sometimes the tooltip popup says most the time it doesnt

in any event its bizarre  lets say a topic of child labour arises and one of these parties puts the edict to outlaw child labour before the council  you will get a popup that essentially asks if you will support or oppose this edict  lets say you pick oppose  you then will contact all the political parties through those 3 aforementioned buttons  heres a great example of a lazy design choice

im opposing this  i want the edict banning child labour to be voted down  yet all my interactions with the political parties will ask the parties to vote yes  like one of the options is yes we need this where i am actually saying no  if you click it it behaves like youre asking them to say no and the sliders adjust accordingly but the actual strings that appear lazily still have the positive messages  the whole game is like this which makes it a pain to play  so im asking the parties to vote no but all the options are telling them to vote yes but when i click on them it behaves as if i was asking them to vote no  clever huh

the interactions are very abstract  you can bully them but it doesnt do anything more than move a slider  it doesnt feel like im being a jerk mayor or hardline bully  i dont feel like im mayor daly from chicago  none of that  its abstract  the way the numbers work everything regresses to the mean so as long as youre not constantly a bully youre swiftly forgiven

4 as a mayorpolitical sim this is the most boring game i have ever played  theres nothing to do of any interest  its just tedious  

it tries to insert childlike humour into an otherwise seriously presented game  i hate that when developers think thats clever  certain developers can pull it off such as in fallout or baldurs gate because its cleverly done  heres an example

im trying to get an edict passed and one of the threats to the conservative party is to say to them agree with me otherwise youll be known as the conservatard party  classy

5  this feels primarily like running a business sim on a phone app  its cosmetic and veneer feeling

6 nothing you do is very exciting  i pressure the council to try to get a train station built in a predetermined location  they say no  i wait about five minutes and i ask them again  this time my bullying suceeded  uhm yay  it was seriously just clicking a couple buttons with no actual strategy or interest   youre bullying a nameless and faceless lever

7 eventually one of the parties will have a split and youll have the old and young  they dont really seem to remember how you treated them before  as i said everything regresses to the mean

this game is worth maybe 900 for value as a mobile app in its current state  maybe dlc will fix things but im not sure how given the design this could be made more interesting

#####

just seeing the first page reviews im rather appalled that people think there is nothing to this game or that it is too hard or that it should be similar to cities skylines it is none of that this is a different city sim altogether you do not lay roads individually or place zones where you want them although i wish you could for the zones at least you build a city through the eyes of a politician through an old world council  or more precisely a europeanbased political cabinet its a different take and challenge and i welcome it i am not debating its mechanics since im just starting out but the first impression that it has been wrongly given you cannot approach this game with the typical city sim mentality at all you have to carefully balance your budget understand how to grow you city while also balancing party influence so that you can continue to build since depending upon your political emphasis people can vote you out if there is too much conflict from yours and other political parties so it is challenging but in a very good way 

this is one of those games it seems like that there are many paths you could take but youre not going to be able to hit the gold mine and do everything and have the most 1337 city known to mankind you have to make choices so there is realism in this game 

it really makes me wonder the percentage of complaints below of its too hard because i want to play it like other city sims and what the real rating for this game would actually be apparently it got a rough start and thats an unfortunate hit too


update ive played a game all the way through every stage to the point you get a victory this took 19hrs and it was my very first game  no redos in my case i managed the victory of making it through every stage i wasnt paying too close of attention since i continued onward with the game im glad it gave me that option but it appears you go to the year 2020 

whats my impression i love this game it is very challenging and for a while there i wasnt sure i was going to make it but got to stage v and the economy was easier to manage my city was so poor and in the red for a long time that only a few districts had the privilege of running water and even fewer had electricity i definitely learned a few things about establishing an economy and am excited to try a whole new game to see what i can make happen 

i really like the storytelling aspect to it as you get to create a kind of history with your game that is rather faint but left to your imagination when i would play civ games or the total war games or any city sim game  this seemed more personal i do wish when there were world conflicts and possibly smaller ones that might affect you that you felt it and had to make choices like you do any other time for example since you do get the arms industry i thought perhaps you might try to promote that industry during a war or have a political aspect that may involve a vote on helping another country out or something that would really make you feel like youre part of a bigger world instead of feeling closed in to the city that youre building the game hints at some sort of economic hit but thats all i could tell 

but it was exciting and frustrating in every regard that made this game interesting it is a pitty that it had a rough start and it is a greater pity that a lot of people are not seeing this game at a different and deserved angle since there is potential to make this super interesting if the developers went deeper into this game id say with the big upset the devs have better time spent with something else

#####

this game is a great political simulator  no matter what you do you feel like your actions arent making any difference

#####

have to agree with a lot of the recent reviews i was so hyped for this game watching quill18s youtube channel but when you get the chance to play it yourself it really is repetitive and it lacks the engaging gameplay i thought it would be as others have also said you find this out after the twohour time limit is past for the refund really disappointed

#####

pretty good game but not yet great only on my first playthrough but it scratches a lot of the itches i have in gaming 

 it has a simplified citybuilding part which i welcome as it has a clear place in the game  
 it has political simulation this is also a bit simplistic at parts you basicly buy votes with goodwill there is not that much to it so far if you have enough goodwill you can swing votes in your favor and goodwill goes to a default state which depends on you general standing in the city so far i havent done anything in particular to make this good and i have not had any problems getting what i want i will update this review if it turns out that the system is deeper later in the game 
 it has dynasty building i love this you have choices to make about your son who you get to play later 
 it has a pretty large research tree with narration when something is discovered a bit of civilization feeling 

so to me it seems it has elements of sim city the guild civilization and crusader kings i dont think they are just mashed together without thought i think they work just fine 

i only have two complaints so far the first is what i already said the political system should be a bit more complicated i just know when ive spent enough goodwill to get the vote because it tells me how many will vote yes and no and so far there hasnt been any surprises everything is a bit simple but thats not necessary a bad thing as the game has many layers and if all were complicated it would get lost in them however the main attraction should be a bit deeper unless its depth is gradualy introduced in which case as i said ill update the review 
the second is technical i wish it was possible to increase drawing distance i dont have any technical problems or glitches it works fine but objects dissappear very soon 

im having fun so far hope replayability wont be a problem so far recommended 

to be honest i thinks its too early to review at all for anyone but already the i play on an abacus and it crashes after a few minutes reviews popped up and its a much better game than to deserve failing due those so here is my honest opinion after a but more than an hour

update it really starts to get much better in the 3rd era it is now kind of democratic you are elected and have to fight to stay in power your council is also elected which makes it possible to attack your problems with them from different angles 
for example in my last term i had a really hard time i made some bad zoning decisions and the town was bleeding money by the mayoral elections we were deeply in debt to remedy this until the unused zones get back in shape i tried to raise taxes but the freedom party and the communists always stopped it also making them my mortal enemies by the time the mayoral elections arrived 
i was going to lose it badly but i had one chance i had a lot of dirt on those two the communists were easy at the first sign of trouble they yielded and gave me full support the freedom party on the other hand would rather have me out them but refused to cooperate so thats what happened i had enough of the goodwill of the other parties to win the election by a very small margin 
then another term went by the economy was still bad but the communists started to like me as we agreed on a lot of proposals i still couldnt raise taxes and i didnt want to use my goodwill to do so as the mayoral elections looked like a disaster then came the elections for the council and the communist party won big time the freedom party however was reduced to almost nothing due to all the bad stuff that were revealed during the last mayoral elections this gave me majority support in the council so im still in game the taxes are raised so the budget is recovering and population is rising again 
it could still be more complicated but it already strikes all the right chords with me

#####

dont buy this game  avoid
its not worth the asking price whatsoever  if you must get it i recommend you pay as little as possible

keep in mind this is a political simulator masked as a city building game with an incomplete feel  if this interests you then keep reading  i wanted to like this game and played it over 100 hours but i strongly dislike it

here is why i strongly dislike it
1 entirely imbalanced game mechanics at all stages early mid and lategame  at best consider this game at midway betalevel test development requiring a significant rebalance not ready for prime time  its abandoned by the development team and therefore theyll never fix its problems
     some sillier examples are spoiler you can successfully avoid ever installing running water or a sewer system in densely populated areas never establish a police station anywhere and achieve better security from just a fire department even in a population of over 90000 people yet install police callboxes everywhere to improve the perception of security drive on the same gravel road from the 1800s until the end of time with no traffic controls but muh airconditioning and recycling center are nonnegotiable spoiler  this doesnt even scratch the surface of more serious imbalances

2 grossly lacks meaningful associations of most causes  effects  the player may be offered or restricted from certain choices of action without indication of any particular outcomes  likewise negative and positive unexpected events frequently occur with no indication of how or why which could allow the player to respond accordingly  since the game frequently prompts the player to choose an action but it withholds or obstructs useful information regarding any anticipated outcome hint outcomes are not what you may first think the player frequently makes blind choices and passively accepts their outcomes
     for example one moment your adversarial political parties oppose you and for reasons unknown within the algorithm your adversaries opinions change  but the player cant know why which offers no opportunity to learn
     another example the tax revenue may fall with no useful data explaining why though the player must react and fix the unknowable problem to avoid losing the game
     the development team defends this game design as typical life in politics  i contend that truly random inexplicable behavior doesnt mimic sane real life  furthermore when a political leader makes decisions lacking any practical knowledge of cause  effect that is unfettered incompetence and cannot make for an enjoyable simulator or satisfying game play

3 usable data are delivered to the player in an unusable fashion  data are presented as pages and pages and more pages of tables of simple numbers with vague descriptions  these numbers are a mere granular snapshot of whats happening within the game at that moment  unless the player has extraordinary ability to memorize pages of numbers and compare these pages within ones mind as time passes or manually record every number to an external spreadsheet and transform the game into a dataentry simulator i contend that alternatively these data ought to be delivered as graphs to display event trends  otherwise decisionmaking defaults to simple guesswork to manipulate particular numbers

4 the tutorial is sorely lacking  it guides you through only the initial actions of the game and leaves most mechanics unexplained  it focuses on delivering a narrative about people  places that have no practical use  it wont equip you to develop any strategy to progress  this you must learn through trial  error in unclear uninformative unenjoyable ways  its like groping through a dark room for the correct lever to pull among a sea of other levers where many levers are certain selfdestruct mechanisms not identifiable as such which essentially tricks the player into poor choices
     you could search outside of the game for serendipitous explanations by watching random lets play videos or optimistically trawling online forums  i dont consider these suitable game documentation or enjoyable

5 beware anytime the tutorial is not yet satisfied with the completeness of your actions it will silently prevent you from saving your games progress  the solution would be to complete the outstanding action but if done at an undesirable moment is very likely you will effectively sabotage any successful strategy you may have had  if you do not perform the action but also need to shut down the game you must forfeit all unsaved game progress  i discovered the communitys recommended workaround is to not begin the game with the tutorial since its optional but that seems rather selfdefeating in purpose

6 the player can too easily enter into a death spiral that has no recovery  since many ingame events occur by inexplicable chance or wonky causes without useful help to respond you can somewhat expect to lose the game and need to start over  if you arent making obvious successful strides or somehow lose a lot of momentum  i recommend to quit the game and start over  save yourself time and frustration  even if you knew what particular choices you could make to a recovery there remains an artificial game clock as it were that will restrict your opportunities to make these choices and may shut you out from recovery   that is until you discover how to keep the game perpetually afloat even when it defies reality 

7 the game play follows a prescribed underlying political narrative which is a reflection of the development teams political biases that shine throughout the game  these biases tend to artificially limit or punish the player if the player makes political choices that contravene these biases if the player does not align with the narrative the player will definitely lose the game  be aware this is not a sandbox game where the player can legitimately explore different playing styles to reach a satisfying outcome

8 the english text often distracts because its unnecessarily wordy suffers from awkward or incorrect word choice grammatical errors etc  for example the game offered a choice of actions that i improperly understood because the instructions were too ambiguous  i guessed my best action according to what i anticipated the game wanted of me see my earlier comments about the games political biases  though i did correctly guess what political bias the game expected of me the game punished me hard because i chose the incorrect course of action that it wanted from me

9 the game offers a highly detailed animated 3d model of the city map that has no useful benefit to the game  it fact since its function was so poorly optimized the 3d map serves only to drag down your computers performance and does so ever increasingly without end as the game progresses  your frame rate will noticeably dip and stutter no matter how powerful your computer especially during lategame i progressed beyond the year 2188 and performance became almost unplayable though my computer is plenty powerful  to what end  this game is nothing more than reading dialogs and tables of numbers with some basic animations and stillimages included for flair  a still city map viewable from an even higher elevation would have been more useful

10 the tech progression tree is presented in an arbitrary order with no indication of negative consequences from particular choices  the tech tree can unwittingly be navigated in a wrong order locking out critical elements of progress when you need them leaving you no choice but to delete your game and start over  see my earlier comment about an artificial game clock

11 bugs and more bugs

ill end it here  congratulations if you read everything  i could add more but i have other ways id prefer to spend my time

#####

as someone who has played 11 hours on this game had three different campaigns and basically got all the ways to win and get a victory i must say this game still has must work to do

bits fun halfway inb the tutorial is bullshit and the rci demand is a lie keep building districts and make sure you keep an eye on taxation i cannot stress this enough like the developers have hinted this game is bnot a citybuilderb but rather a cityruler type of game a new type of subgenre for strategy games and i think this is a great idea this game also adds an interactive and engaging storyline for each one of the houses if the engine decides to give you those events
 more in depth  

bpoliticsb the politics in this game are utter garbage a leftwing conservative party like the communists will support increase taxation for lowerclass members and less taxation for upper classes fdp are just a nuscane at the beginning and there is no way you can play this game in a conservative way as the game forces you to progress 

i think the political system is just shallow and lame needs much more design for example the political compass should be authoritarian  libertarian socioeconomic compass instead of conservativeliberals i would also suggest to the developers to add a trait system to parties which will hinder their like to vote fororagainst different legislation so we dont have commies voting for increasing church funding anyways yes the politics of this game are engaging but this feels more like barriers these parties have no life to them

bnovelstoryb the story is interesting and as i said earlier if youre lucky enough to get the game to give you them sometimes it doesnt and you start out with a really shitty ruler or you dont know anything about the ruler except what the game gives you every era happened to me in era ivv the von pfilzens are interesting and so are the kilgannons probably my favorite families to play in this game

bcitybuilding aspectb now i know this is not a citybuilder but a cityruler but it does have the citybuilding element to it and frankly its shallow and lame its not engaging as i thought it was you dont have much say in how different grids and spreads are choosen aside from the change the spread of a district thing going through eras it becomes a general burden to upgrade your districts the game offers no total district change stuff so you have to keep changing infrastructure and roads manually which usually ends up being rejectedoraccepted depending on the parties in control i wish the devs would put more focus on this aspect and the politics as they did on the story

binvention aka researchb the research part is smart its cool and its engaging i love it theres not much to say i think this is where the game excells in different researchinventeions give you different edicts upgrades and unlocks new stuff but by era iv theres nothing new to unlock really except for upgrades

bengine  soundb sound is great music is great engine i heard people have had crashes and that sucks i have only experienced one when transferring over to era v thats when it moved me back to era 2 for some reason and it crashed the game in graphics really lacks i have a gtx 1070 that can run ark and other games in probably the highestres and so on on 1080p and probably 4k but somehow this game makes sure that my fps is below 30 and constantly lags drops or some other weird shit like damn fix your stuff rebel


biin shortib this game had potential still has i am not sure what went wrong with the devs but i have to unfortunately give this game a 50 rating and this is coming from someone who has 11 hours in the game and got almost all the victory achievements i would not recommend this game at its current stage and i fear for the worse that kalypso and rebel media plan on adding and fixing a lot of these issues in overpriced dlcs  current rating is not recommended will change if patched and changed over time

my message to the developers please do not make this a dlcexpanded game fix your issues and patch the game up before any dlcs

anyways this is my take on the game feel free to add me on steam if youd like to hear more about my pros and cons in regards to this game or if youd like me to help you out with strategy and development of your cities if you bought the game

#####

this game sounds interesting when you read the game description and even appears to be interesting when you start playing it the combination of city builder throughout the ages and a political simulation with a municipal council sounds like a great idea 
the result however is unfortunately disappointing the city builder aspect of the game is quite simplistic and cannot compare with other city building games out there when it comes to depth and options the political aspect on the other hand which apparently was to be the main selling point of the game appears interesting at first but it soon becomes apparent that it can be easily manipulated and abused your council will accept almost anything you propose if you have a positive cashflow while it will refuse almost anything if your budget is in the red 
in the end the entire experience of the game is quite shallow and boring 


#####

lots of promise although i didnt have many of the graphical issues that are being presented in a lot of these reviews the game just fell short in a lot of other ways  i can appreciate obfuscating some of the raw numbers driving certain game mechanics but the economy is nearly impossible to manage in any meaningful way  upgrades to townships dont seem to have the kind of impact youd expect  you can be in the late game with huge swaths of your townships still working on gas lighting and unimproved streets and no one seems to care

additionally while i can appreciate that one political ideology may be favored by the developers and its success influenced by their own ideologies but the other political spectrums should at least be viable which they are not  this is a game afterall and viability of the other paths would increase replayability  the political system was a unique spin on the city building genre at least that was my take on it in the beginning  however it quickly becomes tedious and as mentioned above shoehorns you down a specific political path  

with the lack of updates and fixes that came from the developer post launch im definitely suffering from buyers remorse  a real missed opportunity here  i would not recommend this without a deep deep discount

#####

bthis game is a fascinating mess  i really want to like it but i cant recommend it in its current form and even if it worked as intended its far too expensive for what you getb

h1 genuinely new concepth1

it deserves top marks for its ideas its not a city builder but rather a political simulator in a city builders skin the whole game involves proposing legislation and taking it to the city council where you employ political tricks to get what you want this part of the game is immensely satisfying working with or against political parties to get your laws passed and then seeing the effects of that ingame is what gives you the biggest thrill

h1 no cause and effecth1

unfortunately almost every other aspect of the game needs major work the biggest problem is the lack of clear cause and effect despite a very busy ui youre never quite clear on what your actions wil do the developers have defended this on discussion boards by saying its a realistic depiction of politics but this is a cheap copout the fault lies in the confusingly messy and random ui which sometimes gives tooltips and sometimes doesnt the badly translated stats  eg whats sales demand or vote process and the lack of obvious links between many factors in the game eg density and infrastructure in addition some of the events are downright contradictory i sided with the progressive young swarelian party to decrease taxes on students but the legislation that was enacted increased said taxes by 5

h1 lack of polishh1

some of the game eg the familymap selection screens is beautiful the rest is laggy and glitchy even on powerful rigs theres currently a very bad memory leak which results in major slow down in the latter third of the game even when settings are optimised the main map screen looks dated this would be much less of an issue if the gameplay problems were fixed

#####

i had high hopes for this game maybe thats why i was so disappointed by it

the concept sounds promising real cities dont exist in a vacuum and mayors arent dictators so why not introduce some political and historical elements into gameplay

unfortunately the execution is flawed ingame history pretty much follows a predetermined path based on realworld european history you have monarchy giving way to democracy workers fighting for better working conditions womens suffrage etc note some players apparently perceive this as leftist ideology but id argue its simply a representation of the developments during this period european society at the time of the industrial revolution was far more authoritarian and conservative than what we have today so in order to get from there to here things had to move to the left

the problem is that this leads to repetitive gameplay it may be realistic that a single mayor cant change the course of history but it also means that you cant really explore alternative options but simply have to go with the flow public opinion will always shift a certain way around a certain time and if you want to stay in office you always have to adapt in the same ways basically the political part is more about reacting to a prewritten script than about having any actual influence and that just gets old really fast research is similarly restricted get certain techs for certain improvements so you can do the things the script needs you to do at this time

its a pity because there technical side of the game is perfectly fine for the genre they just couldnt find a way to make the gameplay engaging for more than an hour or two at full price currently 45 eur its definitely way too expensive if you can pick it up for 10 10 euros or less it might be worth a look just dont expect more than a few hours of play time out of it

#####

urban empire completely misses the mark it is neither an effective city builder or political simulator for example

you cant make deals with the other city council members as in there is no way to approach another member and say hey if you vote on this project i need ill vote on that other project you need you cannot make political compromises in this game which is a necassary feature for any good political simulator

instead if you want something done you can either use bribes or give a speech the other houses only exist to vote yes or no you cannot actually interact with them

do not buy this game

#####

this game is exactly what they say it is  a mayor  city strategy game  simulator  its not really a city builder and the reviews dinging it because of that are nothing short than people not understanding what the developers have created

if you enjoy strategy  simulator games and have always wanted to create a long lasting family dynasty this game is for you

#####

i ignored the negative reviews and bought it on sale  had i known this was as good as it is i would have paid full price  it is exactly as the description says so do not think you are getting a city builder  this is more or less a political city simulator  this is a mayor simulator  you cannot build without permission the city council has to approve projects just like in real life  you want to add electricity to a district then you better make sure you have the budget and the support behind the many political parties behind you  

it is not as complex as many on here make it seem  yes it is hard but this type of game is for those who like a strategic challenge  you played for 3 hours and think you wasted your money then you have no patience or concept of mastery  this game literally requires practice patience and strategy  you wont learn everything the first time but as you play you figure it out its within its design

buy if
you want strategic different challenging  you want to have a management challenge and dare to dap in simulated politics economics and wish to feel like what it is like to deal with city councils

do not buy if
you wish to buy a sim city or cities skylines type game if you want a dictator like city builder buy tropico for that  if you want the games playbility handed to you

20 hours and multiple victories in

urban empires is an okay game it seriously lacks depth once you bite into it and the developers didnt really put much attention into making sure that multiple play styles are competitive at the end of the day the best move is to just go fully socialist liberal since almost all related edicts are totally positive anyway im willing to bet that the overwhelmiongly positive effects that liberal and leftists edicts give is at least partially based on the developers own political opinions there should be multiple feasible paths to victory even if you dont agree politically such a shame really

gay rights yes feminism of course the bonuses are too good to pass same for child labor womens rights lgbt rights etc rinse and repeat i get that many of us support these things in real life but in a game each choice needs to have benefits and flaws the game rewards progressive ideas by removing all flaws

furthermore the political parties are nothing more than a simple resource system they have no agency or personality of their own the other players in the game lack any sense of reason behind their choices they dont have any clearly seen agenda and this hurts the game immenseley yes liberals are more likely to vote for more taxes and conservatives are more likely to oppose them but thats as far as the depth goes 

my last point focuses on events and the world at large as you play diffferent events come to pass on the world stage but ultimatley it doesnt matter what you do or how you react it always plays out the same way with no real consequences for choices or outcomes of events it doesnt matter if you support independence or not because at the end of the day it all disappears without explanation when you move to the next era i didnt even realize we got independence until i saw some random screen with a reference it didnt even matter this happens with every event tied to the larger world

tldr the developers hit on a great concept and if the game was 10 bucks id say they nailed it as far as liberal progressive sjw style games go at 4000 dollars we deserve far more depth and far more meaningful choicesoptions leave your politics at home and just focus on making a good game please devs

#####

needs a coat of polish and a price drop but this scratches an itch for a niche that hasnt ever been filled  im a student in land use and government law among others and ive been waiting for a game that makes you less of a god mayor simulator where you design a city without limitation but more of a county supervisor simulator where even small actions are political and costly beyond just the bottom line of the city  this is that game it just needs a bit more work  kalypso has a history of releasing games that have great core ideas but need a bit more work and this is another example of the same  the game needs a few more rounds of optimization as it shouldnt be causing my computer so many problems  the ui needs work and just everything needs paradox style tooltips to explain what it does and how it plays into the city as a whole  finally the political simulator needs a bit more difficulty thrown in or the economy does  but still if this is a game that will receive a lot of postrelease support than it could easily become a longtime favorite  40 is a bit steep for the state it is in now though

#####

this game was a big disappointment to me it had promise but as its done with the past tropicos kalypso fails to deliver

first off you are herded towards adopting certain decisions you can say no and oppose but it will eventually be brought back up and it will be more and more impossible to allow for a reform to pass and if you look at these decisions with anything but a roleplaying or contrarian mind you will have no reason not to support them 

the von pfilzens are traditional aristocrats thats who i played as yet when some reforms against my own ideals came up i saw there were no downsides to them it was all raw benefits if there were any downsides they were easily crushed by the potential benefits so what did i actually get out of playing the von pfilzens instead of another family little more than their starting modifiers which barely did anything interesting as is

in tropico games you had options on how you wanted to build your city even if its consequences were limited from a capitalist paradise to a communist utopia to a fascist dictatorship in the later games you tended to go towards the communist path but the choice was still there in this game it is nowhere to be found

second what happens around the world never affects what happens in your little bubble provincecity of swareliakaisershafen in fact when you pass certain reforms the entire country youre in suddenly decides to do so too shouldnt the world be affecting me all i get is some newspapers the entire nazi war machine might just cross over swarelia and i wouldnt even notice outside of one or two events and a newspaper telling me

third you are forced into a democracy as ideologies like communism and fascism rise you are still forced to get elected by the parliament in the 3rd era not cool in a game like this you could easily represent your rise to power through the two totalitarian ideologies and maybe do some politicking for the entirety of swarelia to join up with you hell at first glance youd think theyd do something like this considering there are two families that literally scream fascist and communist in your ears 


now lets leave the wasted potential behind and look at the gameplay

its boring and bland thats what defines this game when new technologies pop up you tick a new checkbox in a district and wait for the vote with 100 support to pass do this for every other district all the time to keep it competitive lay down some dumb buildings to keep peoples happy numbers up theyre not gonna starve or revolt theyll vote you out if you dont do it right so everything is fine

the politics game well rack up goodwill points with parties and when you want to get something passed you use one of three options to make them support the edict parties have no personality no real members theyre just in a leftright conservativeliberal xy axis which makes them support an edict or the other more youll always want to get the same stuff passed since its what brings in bonuses thatll keep the city afloat youll sometimes get events that pretend to give parties some character but they are usually without real consequence and will only give you more nice guy points with the parties thats all

and yes there is little else to the gameplay


to conclude its not a bad game per se but it is in no way worth the price for it it has no meat and what little meat you can find is barely edible this game would need a complete revamp to be entertaining for more than one or two hours but knowing how kalypso works after years of following their tropico games it wont happen

have a good day and thanks for reading

#####

squallmizza said it best 

so i read the reviews and thought nah it cant be that bad

it is believe the reviews the choices you make seem to have very little impact and the causality of 90 of the statistics peppered throughout are not remotely explained theres no mapping as to what actions favour which parties or inclination of any real difference to your characters influence around it

it really really is that bad dont buy this game


#####

not as bad as the reviews would suggest its fun for maybe a couple playthroughs no sandbox four campaigns which are scripted four scenarios and thats it no mods not even any dlc there is zero optimization so even though the game looks like a 2012 remaster of a 2004 game it runs at sub20 fps on my midhigh range pc youll get a solid 50 in the early game but once you have four districts built its all downhill from there gameplaywise the game looks really hard until you learn how to pull the political parties to your side then the game is so easy youll never have a problem doing anything its worth 750 its a solid experience if you want something different just keep your expectations on the floor and youll have some fun

#####

do not buy not pleasing at all

i saw quills demo of it and he made it out to be a lot better than it actually is  the concept is awesome but the political swaying back and forth really doesnt seem to have any great affect to what happens in the game as advertised

great idea but just did not come up to stuff



#####

i rarely review games due to extreme apathy but i had to make an exception this time i cannot recommend this game as much as id like to and i really would like to be able to i loved the idea behind this and as soon as i heard about it i knew i had to try it this is the sort of game i had been waiting for and i wish more developers would bring out games along these lines i have however been left extremely disappointed by this developer and the game that has been released there has been little to no reaction to the community response and there has been one or maybe two patches since release neither of these patches have focused on the big problems within the game ive given it around 33 hours and until a major patch gets released im not going to give this game any more of my time the numerous bugs and shallow game play are just not worth bothering with it would also be nice if the game actually had tooltips and told you how to play
reborn games are going on my blacklist of developers i will avoid in future

#####

dont buy  devs have been quiet for over two months so it would not be along shot to belive they have abandond the game so do not make the mistake of buying this game

#####

i got it on sale but for 40 an overpriced boring game 

1 theres not much depth at all proven by the game manual of a few pages of things you already knew from any lets play videos on youtube if youve seen one video on this game you saw 100 of the gameplay besides late game eras and no it doesnt save itself by then

2 the ui is clunky  having to toggle between too many panels to do simple actions 

3 use dense grid always dense grid theres no strategy in which zones to use infact using sparse grids will cost you more by far  as you have to cover all that space with extra services 

4 for a political game it misses the point entirely hell its not even a politcal game its a voting game theres no real replay value to govern as liberal or consertative  a tryannt or a benovolent hero  it all means the same thing for example a liberal will want pass unions as much as conserative just simply because its buffs all your services

5 overpriced

just for refrence on my current playthrough im a couple hours in everything is passing without effort and im sitting on my ass wondering what to do with my hands as a third of this game is paying attention to random events and picking a choice another third is researching tech sitting on my ass and picking what i want my lamps to look like the last third is voting and acting like you give a crap as you give a district some cobblestone roads for some enivorment boost yay

now i can place a new district rinse and repeat

they shouldve just taken this idea of game and combined with a new tropico to revitizle the franchise so that way when im bored out of my mind i can at least kill all the council members and actually have a game to play

#####

this game is a fun take on city management you dont have to micromanage your city building that pretty much happens by itself instead you need to convince the city council to approve your plans for the city you need to handle the various political parties choose to compromise with them or support one of them and aim to help them win the majority of votes the political simulation is interesting and the whole game depends on how you handle it however there are weaknesses to this system more on that later

also newer buildings lawsedicts and upgrades are unlocked through research and a tech tree the tech tree seems a bit small i think in 20 minutes gameplay i already went through 15th of the tech tree with only 2 schools built schools generate research points among other things nonetheless the way its set up is interesting and has good potential for further development

a big part of the game are events if you play any paradox grand strategy games you know what i mean by events occasionally something will happen that will require your attention you will be presented with a problem and 3 solutions on average it both gives flavor to the game and allows for roleplaying it also lends replayability as depending on your choices you will probably end up going through a much different story each time events can serve to introduce new laws and edicts further each technology will give you at least one event while its being researched related to it

so far the game runs smoothly no bugs or problems its a bit slow on loading screens but thats not such a big deal

my main issue is that i bought this game because it promises a deep political simulator but i dont feel it delivers on that on the surface everything seems interesting and good but once you get into it problems start appearing as advertised for everything you try to do in the city new buildings tax reform lawsedicts new districts introducing gas and electricity etc you will need the city councils approval to actually do it the problem is that political parties hardly exhibit any intelligence the main factor for their decision making is if the proposed plan will take your citys budget to negative there is no consideration for projected profit there is very little adherence to ideologies presented in the political spectrum

for example the simplest problem you need to increase your income the best way to do it is to build new districts and increase taxes tax increases are suprisingly easy to pass but they are not enough alone to let you develop your city at most you can support 23 buildings with a 10 increase in taxes so you need to build new districts but this projects a tremendous drain on your budget with a school a police station and an electrical grid the running cost goes to 80k money with 1 district already built the best you can do is 2030k income for which you need to spend a lot of political power to get getting the council to let you build a new district is nigh impossible and tedious the only solution is to sit and watch your single district for some time doing nothing just so you can gain enough political capital to implement a change and after that its again spending a lot of time doing nothing

there are 3 stances you can take with each party plead demand threaten each one will give you some options on what you can do it seems what each choice does is random theres little apparent consistency or reason with each choice furthermore whatever you click in this interaction theres no going back you cant examine your options for example if you click threaten thats what youll do no cancel or go back buttons implemented

this wouldnt have been an issue if

a there were regular methods to regain political power goodwill with the various parties and councilmen instead of waiting for them to tick up for example certain proposals laws and buildings should be favored by certain parties by default especially if they cater to their values

b the parties actually had more detailed scripted behaviors and they took into consideration the gains each project would confer almost everything is for the sake of money my councilmembers apparently hate the idea of police stations street lamps and hospitals because they arent free

c there was a way to bundle proposals together for example build a new hospital and accompany it with a tax increase to overcome the budget issues

my other issue with the game is that it doesnt have edge scrolling meaning you cant stick your mouse on the edge of the screen and expect the map to move you need to click and drag with the right mouse button or use wasd to move around its inconvenient and a weird design decision

the game also seems to only offer 3 maps to play on and i dont see any way to randomly generate maps or create a custom game with a custom family you can only play campaign or narrow scenarios the lack of customization is disappointing to say the least

if and when these issues are fixed consider picking up this game without these problems id highly suggest it its otherwise a very fun game with good atmosphere welldone graphics nice music interesting mechanics and great potential until then i suggest you wait a while and check back later

#####

oh my i wanted this game at release i love slow paced strategy games and play most of them read some bad reviews so waited and waited on sale for less than 6 i decided to buy it played it for alot of hours for less than 6 but they have been frustrating and boring hours the game imo is bad gameplay and understanding of mechanics is terrible the tutorial sends you off in the wrong direction straight away imo dont bother guys shame cause i usually love the games these guys make

#####

read before buying it 

urban empire is not a city builder i mean it has city builder elements in it but its mostly a political simulator which lets you play between ages also its a very very hard game so do not expect a plreasent ride

still i find it amusing dealing with all these political parties and solving state problems game is good actually but its unbalanced and acting weird so keep these in mind before buying it

h1urban empireh1

urban empire is a game that promises to combine a great city builder with deep political roots does it stands up to its claims or buries itself in the ground lets find out

h1gameplayh1

urban empire is a game which tells you about the game that it was meant to be not the one it actually is right now a game with good city building mechanics like cities skylines and having deep political mechanics like crusader kings ii has been a dream game for many of us to some extent urban empire is a showcase of such a game

 it starts off with style and intrigue you choose one of the four races which are going to rule the city all four of them are given proper backdrop and their lore differentiates them from one another perfectly one might be a dictator type civ which believes in forcing rules on people to run the city peacefully while another is one which excel with communicating people but are relatively newer in politics and  does not have much clue what is going on these strengths and weaknesses of the four races help you get invested in the start of urban empire after selecting one of these races you can choose who is going to be the leader of the family and who are you going to play as till this point urban empire makes you care about these factions and their leaders but it starts to falter when it comes to actual city building

what we enjoyed about 2015s cities skylines and city builders of such quality are non existent here building and managing your cities are confined to some very simple mechanics  you place a district on the map manage the cost it takes to maintain the district and bam youre done there is little to no customization about this aspect of the game a thing which sticks out as an open wound

 the cash flow you get for building these districts is pretty nice and you dont need to worry about running out of cash until late into game when industrial revolution and such comes into play the cities you build do not feel like actual cities which you built but more like cities which were made by themselves when you ordered no managing of roads or actual in depth city building is present here

what is the saving grace of the game and more or less the selling point is the political system it is far more deeper than the city building mechanics and offer some challenge as you move further in the game factions start to split up and cause mayhem you can select how your successor is raised and how they control the dynasty in the next era it is not without its faults though

 while the political system offers challenge and inserts some character in its dynasties it is way too repetitive you cannot expect to replay the game and see drastic changes from your first playthrough political parties more or less behave the same and do not offer anything different

 you dont want to pay price for a retail game and then expect such short replayabilty from a game of a genre which is known for its replayable games there are also some really long sections in the game where it feels like a monotonous affair without much achievement the tutorial present in urban empire is also very short and does not introduces you to some of the major mechanics in the game while urban empire has an interesting political system just do not expect it to be on par with games like crusader kings or europa universalis a lot of bugs and crashes also dampen the experience of the game it constantly crashes to desktop or back to menu which deletes your progress constantly and makes it a frustrating experience

h1visualsh1

urban empire impresses with its visuals from the get go you are introduced to a clean ui in the main menu the faction logos and leaders are represented really well visually and shine throughout the game the cities are dense and full of small details they look good and are vibrant in nature colours pop out at you while you building and managing cities and the events while plenty never clutter up the screen to provide a pleasent gaming experience

h1soundh1

one word excellent what urban empire doesnt show in its gameplay it shows it in its sound design from the ambient and epic soundtrack to the tense build up in the courts urban empire provides solid sound design which compliments its visual design very well

h1overallh1

urban empire promises much and falls flat from the bland city building aspect to the somewhat interesting but ultimately repetitive political system urban empire never reaches up to the hype it creates itself if it was a game which was released for a cheaper price and less promises i wouldve recommended trying it but at a price like this i expect more from a game it needs polish and deeper systems i would recommend getting this game at a sale where you can test it out for yourself but not in its current state

h1prosh1

intriguing political mechanics

solid visuals and sound design

h1consh1

bland citybuilding

repetitive in nature

plenty of bugs

its everything i wanted but essentially unplayable 

numerous victory conditions are unintuitive or possibly even unattainable

the tooltip is frequently wrong and frequently broken if it exists at all

the game is not at all balanced if you want to make money which isnt necessarily required but it is useful then you should never change anything about your districts  just make sure your industry districts fill up all others dont matter because an industry district will make you 35x more than any other district and the others will only break even and thats unfortunate because the infrastructure part of the game looks really interesting  theres just no financial reason to make use of it after copious testing i found that most infrastructure cost more in maintenance than it would improve in income  a few times it might break even

but the core concept of the game is solid

#####

was so excited for this game but it was nothing but frustration from the start its horribly buggy even after a few hotfixes the devs have disappered though so now the game is just an unfinished piece of garbage ill be careful before i spend my money on another kalypso title i dont care how much this appeals to you dont buy it you will regret it

#####

wonder why so many people hate this game theres a long winding answer 

urban empires was origonally marketed as having the following game play niches

1 it it was a decent citybuilding strategy game 
2 it had a political aspect you would have to manipulate the political parties and make deals to pass key legislation 
3 it would have a branching plot over multiple generations that would tell the story of both your family and the city 
4 your choices would effect how the story plays out

and the game doesnt do any of these things well at all many of people who bought this game felt that they were lied to about the type of game play

ok so it doesnt meet its promises how did it fail why is it a bad game specifically

1 the mechanics of the city building part are neither interesting nor challenging

the city building is not difficult or interesting enough for hardcore strategy players once you figure out that you dont actually need to improve any aspect of your city just slap down districts and a couple schools for brainpower rely on institutions and edicts to raise stats maybe drop a school or pd department or two as you need it thats it you dont need to build anything else unless its in the hard negatives

the political management means very little other than you cant do unpopular things with damned little if any way of making things unpopularpopular its not like you can forge alliances against other parties or try and play people off against one another and even if you did its not like you have to for 99 of the edicts you could pass 

combined this means that the game doesnt offer any interesting srategic challenge once you figure out the above youll figure out what you need to do youll do it and theres no changes to that strategy and no challenges to it


2 the user experience is awful

there are a ton of controls and fiddly bits of the district but you can safely ignore them most of the time thats actually a good thing becuase the tutorial and user interface are so opaque that i have no idea what the advatnage or costs are for doing anything except my experience from playing the game that tells me that any given upgrade is probably not worth it and its not clear how to do anything and when it is youll be marveling at how complicaed it is to do it

do you need to have residenital with your commercial zone to make it work maybe it doesnt tell you commerical zones seem to populate when you build straight commercial districts so i guess is this more or less effective than normal maybe

gas electricity and water raise the efficency of companies in the district how much how much will it cost in maintenence i dunno increasing roads reduces traffic buying public transport increases transit points what do they do i have no idea theres like 30 seperate submenus for each district as well

if this was something like a difficulty curve it would be one thing but a lot of these mechanics genuinely doesnt seem to matter at all its not just that these are hidden opaque mechanics they are hidden and useless mechanics and they are the only things you can really do for example the bonuses from sister cities dont seem to do anything worth mentioning its just another tech that provides a tiny pointless bonus that wont matter all that much 

this makes the late game really painful once you start unlocking stuff in age 23 say you want to upgrade a district you have to make all your changes in a single pass because you can only alter one district at a time this involves muliple submenus with a variety of options a ton of optional buildings to place down zoning sliders and you doing this over 2030 districts did i mention you can only change one district at a time because it requires a vote that takes 3 months to organize 

this adds up to make the game reallllly slow when it gets big this is compounded by another issue

2b the game slows your pc to crawl in midlate game

i dont mean micromanagement i mean the game literally slows to a crawl with no way to increase the rate beyond the barely adequate max speed from earlier eras i was running max speed in era 3 and it was moving about as fast as normal speed from era 1 combined with the micromangement issues playing the mid to late game becomes a tedious grind

 note  this was on early builds in 2017 it may have changed


3 the game has no story narrative and sucks at worldbuilding 

the game sucks at telling a story and does a poor job of making me feel like my character matters my family matters or the city matters this wouldnt normally be a dealbreaker for a sandbox city sim but urban empire was specifically marketed as gigantic branching multigenerational epic ranching story and it just doesnt deliver anything close to that 

the actual decision points are rare and far between and decisions have little narrative impact even major historical events barely qualifying as an an afterthought or a newspaper article 

example  oh look the empire has rebelled and is now a republic oh look its wwi oh look its wwii  you dont interact with the other families or personalities in the city you dont pick whether you side with the axis or allies you dont have any big event trees to worry about the only thing the choices seem to do is give you a few different character traits that mean very little woohoo

the parties are hilariously random and fickle ive had hardright christians support abortion communists deny worker rights and pacifists support violent nationalists theres usually no reason or sense behind their decisions

the whole thing ends up taking away any idea that the game takes place in a world that exists i dont mind game mechanics breaking a narrative immersion or being unrealistic but this level of failure represents a basic lack of effort on the part of the designers to deliver any kind of emotional impact to the game

4 nothing you do really matters 

the main points combine to create a game that makes me feel that nothing i do has any meanigful impact i had researched video games shortly after the 1900s apparently somehow running in a city that had a power plant but no actual electrical grid nothing feels different about my city

nothing looks different at any point the game doesnt really feel very different from era 1 to era 3 as far as i got  the story just sort of shows up as a multiple choice question that will affect a few character states but i dont feel any sort of control over the narrative nor does it in any way feel like a naturally evolving story with compelling characters there arent really any characters

fun factor 

there are a lot of heavily flawed games that are actualy kind of fun hell this is why kalypso is still in business but this isnt one of them the flaws arent endearing or even tolerable and the game lacks any of the character that made games like tropico fun

to sum up
theres no real story despite that being a touted feature 
the games not immersive enough to suck you in 
the games not challenging enough to make you think about it very deeply for very long 
there are no campaigns to finish beyond the first and i couldnt even bring myself to do that because the game had slowed itself to a crawl by the time i was hitting the modern era

verdict this game was sold as an an city and political dynasty simulator and ended up being a crappy city simulator and utterly failing to simulate the political or dynasty part

id only buy this game at very deep discount like 5 or in a humble bundle there are tons of strategy games that are cheaper and better than this every aspect of the game is mediocre at best with no outstanding features i can see providing any real niche appeal

#####

a difficult game to review because its very difficult to tell whether its fun or not its also very difficult to tell just about anything happening in your city i very much enjoyed the opening halfhour getting involved in city politics forming likes and dislikes towards certain parties that opposed the type of city i was trying to create and unlocking different services for the first time

this quickly fizzled out when i advanced to era ii and wanted to try to stimulate my industrial areas to provide taxes to further improve my existing districts and i realised i had no idea how businesses actually work sales demand is counterintuitive lowering it isbetter extra sales efficiency quality and lots of nice other words that the game fails to explain the significance of after some prodding raising and lowering business tax and keeping track of the finances of certain businesses ive managed to work out the general gist of how things work and yet i still feel woefully underinformed about what policies to implement regarding the industrial and commercial sectors and consequently have little intution about what to build in my residential districts 

is the economy growing or shrinking iunno
is my city business friendly iunno
should i take steps to improve conditions for doing business or can they handle a 23 rise in taxation iunno

and its a game where information is key half of the difficulty comes from an irritatingly unhelpful ui which is just unacceptable for a game considered to be in a finished and playable state 

so id suggest saving your money for now at least until one of the great sages among us have figured out how to play it and post a guide because it promises to be quite fun in the moments of clarity you experience from time to time

grudgingly 410

the best federal simulator of all time lose your mind trying to get st done and be constantly blocked by councils politicians and pretty much anyone while drowning in debt

urban empire is basically tropico without power the main reason why it is so unfuriatingly unfun is based on the fact that the mechanics are almost as deep and complex and convoluted as real life municipal politics which makes this an awesome simulation in a way

never before did i lose my mind so much while still being unable to stop keep hurting my very soul by continuing to play this

seriously though this definitely does not deserve all the hate its getting its not simcity you have no power to randomly build stuff and every single plan you have will take forever to scheme your way through the local politics and council decisions in a way its more like the guild than any building game

im guessing most of the people who downvoted this expected a new city builder which this is clearly not and then were frustrated about that very fact

its actually quite enjoyable if those mechanics are something youre looking for personally i had a blast with this for quite a while

#####

im so sad that this game seems to been have left shortly after it came out i was one of the few that really liked the idea of a democratic city builder game instead of the the many dictatorship games out there i do like this game but it should deepen the gameplay with updates and that dosent seem to happend its a ok game but i think you should be somehow into politics to enjoy it i can only recommend this game if its on sale for that kind of money i had hope it would have been updated

#####

great idea but poor execution in the crucial elements of strategy  replayability and balancing
no different ways to play  use the strategy advertised in guides or you will go bankrupt very soon
i hope they will make a second better game based on the idea used here

#####

this game could have been great and may still be great if it were changed to actually be like a political version of citiesskylines as it stands however you may as well just play citiesskylines and pretend that politics exist on top of all of that the price tag is at least 4x too high

#####

btldrb an interesting idea for a novel genre that sadly does not manage to keep my interest


urban empire tries to mix storytelling aspects with citybuilding and strategic maneuvering in politics
i watched lets plays of this before release and i am not terrible shocked to find that the strategy part is a bit shallow and the city building is not the focus of the game so maybe we should understand this as political storytelling game

unfortunately those aspects are not presented in a way that makes me want to find out more the political maneuvering i found very straightforward and while this might get more difficult later on nothing ive seen in any of the previews suggests that the way to handle the different parties changes significantly i think the system might work quite well in a role playing playthrough where you stick with one ideology and try to press it through regardless of what the council thinks though
which brings me to the storytelling aspect unfortunately none of the political parties feel alive enough to make for good stories and your personal story as the mayor character is restricted to a few largely inconsequential events

the graphics are well done and follow a coherent style however the rest of the presentation definitely feels subpar lets just say multiple missing or wrong tooltips and spelling errors just in the first hour of the game doesnt leave a good first impression

so in summary a great and novel idea that sadly falls flat in the execution and does nothing to make me want to play more i guess there might be some potential in here as a political role playing simulator but i just find the core game play not very engaging

#####

i got this game for around 7 bucks and id have probably paid double that for this game now this game is absolutely mired in bad reviews but in a vacuum its a really decent game youre tasked with leading a city through the 19th and 20th century but youre actual involvement in the cities development is slim to none you zone out new districts and place special buildings that boost the brainpower or productivity of the nearby area but who and what settles in those areas is up to what the area needs the game is more of a political sim than it is a citybuilder its always fun using diferent tactics to get what you want and watching your civilization become more progressive or increasingly backwards theres 5 diferent families to choose from and each family gives you unique scenarios to overcome from the kilgannons constantly being attacked for being lowborn to the vilskys being forced to cut off their business ties you absoltuely have to be careful with new projects in this game because getting out of bankruptcy takes a lot of time if you find that your council isnt approving new districts or institutions its probably because you have no money so dont ragequit when suddenly you can get nothing done just raise taxes and start saving money

#####

a game that in theory sounds fun politics an intrigue city building technological progression dynastic elements all sounds great but it falls very flat in implementation

politics boil down to managing your influence and choosing which votes you want to win and which ones you dont mind losing it sounds like it will be fun but it devolves into tedium extremely fast to the point that every time you open up the vote screen which isnt skippable you want to groan a bit and get it over with because the outcome of the vote  pass or fail  is known well in advance the majority of the time 

the city building is obtuse with a ui that does a very poor job making clear what would be of most benefit to your city at any given time further you have very very little control over the city as almost every single thing you do goes to a vote and many times you just cant win reminiscent of reality sure fun gameplay hardly

really one of the problems the game has is the fact that is has many different systems  politics dynasty city building kinda technology  and it does a very very poor job of making them comprehensible to the player and connecting the dots between the systems so its transparent in how that interact transparency in systems is an essential part to any strategy game without transparency strategy becomes random frustrating chance which is too often what you get in urban empire

icing on the bad cake  optimization is poor the best thing the game does is lag on higher speed settings even if you have a beefy machine

the game sounds great on paper i love strategy games i love city builders i love rpgs match made in heaven but ive tried playing this game on several occassions and every time the game has lacked one essential thing  fun go ahead and skip this one you arent missing anything

#####

this could have been a great game but the developers blatantly abandoned it after a few minor patches in the first month or two all patches and communication stopped and we are left with a shell of an ubalanced and bugriddled game

the shame is this had the potential to be my favorite city builder if the devs had just patched the game enough to make it playable even if they hadnt gone on to release any major content patches whatsoever if they had just debugged and balanced the game i would be leaving an overwhelming positive review instead i have to say do not buy this game

they took our money and ran

#####

all the cities eventually feel the same limited amount of events i find that it does a poor job at mimicking the city building aspects like simcity or city skylines but it also fails to have interesting political gameplay unlike tropico or other paradox games

#####

the game works and the concept is great huge problem is that several things are forced on you despite how much you dont want to pass something if the game thinks you should have it it will keep popping back up for a vote until it passes or you run out of favors and influence to prevent it from passing so despite a nonlinear appeal there is none

#####

i really wanted to like this game i was even prepared to overlook the bland dull gameplay the aged graphics and complete lack of modability but alas the game is riddled with bugs too numerous to count

the game promised so much and delivered so little alas not even mods could save it at this point

#####

as it stands the game feels fairly shallow i appreciate its hands off as youre a mayor but be prepared to spend most of your time begging the council to at least let you build a new district if you fail that vote you get to stare at your one district with essentially nothing to do

oh top tip dont install basic utilites like street lights it will econimically ruin the empire and youll have to ask the emporer himself for more funds for your lamps

wait for some patches and a price drop this is a 15 game not 35

edit

to clarify the game feels shallow as the political mecahnics feel almost meaningless they seem to simply serve as a difficulty barrier for example if you are economically struggling you need to build industry to build industry you need to ask the council

council say no

it then doesnt offer up any reason as to why job creation doesnt float any political groups boat for some reason

you then stare at the screen unsure of how to increase funds while the council do nothing its like the game needs you to be hands on but wont let you at the same time

also researching technologies unlocks new types of buildings clothes shops for example yet you have no way to place these as its a hands off appraoch meaning you just have to assume there is a clothes shop some where in the city now

like i said this game lacks depth its not horrific just dont buy it now it will go down in price

#####

not worth the money nearly everyone else is saying it but it cant hurt to add to the cacophony because they are right in nearly every count that ive seen i love city and political simulators so this game could not fit my tastes more but unfortunately this game is lackluster in nearly everyway once you gone through one playthrough which will take you maybe 34 hours you have seen all you are gonna see i cant tell if the economy is too hidden are so simple that you can frequently run on autopilot but it is barely a factor the political game quickly turns into automatically passing 910 votes and then seeing if you want to bother pushing through a few of the other 110 mostly for rp reasons that do not really seem to effect the gameplay in short the economic mechanics are shallow and the political mechanics are shallow and that really is all there is to the game they try to add a cool story element but tying your playthrough to the story and personalities of your ruling family which is cool but it has little impact and the decisions you make dont vary substantially if this ever drops down to 57 these simulator games are already your niche and you dont have anything else to play then pick this up and youll burn a decent few hours getting the hang of the game after that the most satisfying thing to do is making your districts look nice on the map

#####

i wanted this to be a good game but after 23 hours of playtime i cant overlook the big holes in it 

ultimatly this game feels like they have sorted the first era but then ran out of development timeideas so the other four an pointless and unfinished several of the core game mechanics feel broken and in reality this game isnt ready for release 

this is an example of a great concept implemented in the worst way possible and their is ovbiously more focus on getting a game out there to a deadline rather than creating something that worked kalypo should be ashamed of this and i will most definatly avoid thier titles in future

i was excited for this game pre realease seeing it as city builder meets mayor sim in reality it fails at everything and the cons kill any fun you might get out of it

pros
 concept so wish they had implemented something that delviers on just 1 of this
 ealry game feels interesting first 30 mins or so
 tech tree design and look
 concept of familty through several eras is nice

cons
 the game becomes repeataive fast after you have put down 12 districts it reasearch get things approved reaserach again
 your choices make very little difference in reality and after a while you get bored with it
 loads of data tab all usless they dont help you understand whats wrong or what needs improving just tabs of meaningless ifno
 political options are limited and no clear cause and effect
 money is impossible raise tax and noone cares industry going bush with 0 tax rate
 no matter which family you choose the game plays the same
 no matter which map you choose the game plays the same
 income changing for no understandable reason and therefore imposible the take corrective action
 once you get later in game and have to be voted in for 6 year terms you spend all you time pushing this and tech improvements make no difference
 once you get mid game the game starts to lag badly and i dont see why
 once you implement district infrastructure you cant dial back to save money so have little options
 once your past the first era tech tree improvements have little to no impact
 decision made around how you bring up a child doesnt seem to impact in the next era

i dislike this game so much i have requested a refund which is the first time ever if you are thinking of buying this game dont

#####

the concept of this game is great  the execution is lacking

i wanted a game that focussed on the politics of running a city  playing factions against each other ensuring that you had a plurality of support even if upset some groups this is not that game the march of progress is predetermined and your actions have a negligible impact on it more to the point your prior actions count for nothing  council elections ignore your impact on the city and there is not even the prospect of asking for a quidproquo from an ally to get something you want  if their initial inclination is to oppose a proposal your only option is to beg taunt or threaten them into submission at the expense of your previous months of friendship

the game has many many numbersbut no feedback if your city is making a loss there is no indication why and the citybuilderlite approach means that you have no practical way of solving the deficit anyway short of exploiting a glitch in the games logic

i suspect a very large percentage of players are like me  they played once got the end of the line achievement and have no desire to play again which is a shame  this promised to be the game this niche was waiting for but failed to deliver

#####

urban empire is a very niche game despite of its marketing and initial price tag that suggested a quasiaaa title it decides to go against the critically acclaimed cities skylines and it endorses tropicos political system more than ever before why am i endorsing the game they are going in a certain direction that games dont usually go  and as far as i am concerned i like it because its a difficult road and not many players nowadays enjoy the citybuilding  politics combo big time and i think innovations need to be endorsed promoted and helped

thats calypso for you they make awesome niche games focused on the city buildingpolitics combo that just get better  first tropico now urban empire its just all about time  they decided to stop being lazy go on the politics road and keep it up

if you dont like to read then watch me ramble for 20 minutes or so httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvp7v4s5lnwj4

lets take a look at the good

good

1 the politics system really helps the game it wrenches the control out of the players hands and while others would complain i find it the best positive thing in the game this is mfing real life political parties have their own views their own agendas their own principles and try as you might a mayor can only do so much ok short of being the green arrow i guess
2 they have chosen the perfect setting  the second half of the 19th century when things really started kicking into high gear for the humanity as we know it  all over the world i am very happy they did it
3 the different maps provide different challenges and the player needs to plan for that i like it
4 the replayability is good in my book i have played 2 maps with 2 different families and it felt like a different game was it just me carrying over my experience of the first game i dont think so while the setting is relatively similar playing to the strengths of your family is a big deal and enforces a number of different playstyles and speaking about playstyles
5 playstyles differ and work so far in my games i managed to create a workers paradise where the lower class pays almost nothing in taxes and in my other game i managed to create a technocratic society where everyone contributed and went tech crazy i can see so much potential for roleplay here i love it i could say more about the system but the female part of the humankind will hate me and id rather not because i am very much into women as they represent the better part of our society
6 last but not least the city does indeed change because of your actions which is really nice to see whether it will be the buildings the street light hell even the amount of people walking the streets its still a very welcome change from a players perspective

good good good but there is bad and its a lot 

1 the game is easy you will most likely be able to win it in the first go especially if you already have some experience with city builders and how they work
2 prestige while being an awesome thing is used improperly in my opinion it needs to be familymayor based and not accumulated throughout the entire game or at least make it so that you cant use it to overrule mayor elections  because no matter how bad you lose you can still use prestige to stay in power while the cost to stay in power does rise if you are remotely good at this type of game you will win and still sit on a very hefty amount of prestige and about that
3 i just wish that calypso will endorse the fact that gamers do like challenge so far their citypolitics games have been extremely gamerfriendly its like playing xcom losing the mission getting everyone killed but have a itty bitty little button in the corner of the screen that says spend 10 supply to win and by a snap of qs fingers everyone is alive and alls good welp
4 invalid district shape shouldnt have been considered as a game option and district shapes should have been completely overhauled  especially in the types of maps the developers created all those corners do not help the district building people especially in the way you made it inexperienced people will sometimes forfeit a huge chunk of the playing area just because of your regulations thanks but no thanks
5 being a niche game it promises more that people expect i dont like it as it misrepresents many many things the devs made it sound like its cities skylines with a political system  which is something everyone will buy and bite into  and be bitterly disappointed
6 again last but not least there are bugs i myself posted a screenie in which an event cause the game to bug and got me like 7 million debt in a tick even though i was easily in the positive amounts of cash influx  this immediately affected my game as it reduced my ability to play the way that i wanted and forced me to cheat meaning raise a ton of taxes and the parliament agreed easily which also helped me later on  which is a bad thing of course dont get me started on the frame rate drops thank god i am a gamer since 1998 which mens i dont really pay attention to that and it doesnt bother me much  but i know for a fact that it ticks a ton more people to no end

time to interject before the conclusion

you might have noticed that i didnt talk about the graphics the sound etc they are ok and do the game justice what i am trying to say with this review is that even by endorsing this game calypso need to step up their game and understand where the industry is at its about time they introduced multiple difficulties in an appropriate and dare i say meaningful fashion its time to get out of their shell and do the proper thing i know for a fact that they have the capability to do so as they have proven in with the tropico series and this very game urban empire  they just need to do it in their next game or they will always be the niche dev that makes good games for specific audiences but never great games

conclusion

i am endorsing the game because i am having great fun with it and because i believe that the developers have what it takes to step up their game and make the next cities skylines with a politics system it may happen or not  but it is hard for me not to get by the fact that i am having lots of fun playing urban empire and that i find each family to pose different challenges  and as some of you might know i judge my games by game hours vs value  and to me this one sure as hell merits it each playthrough lasts about 8 hours and with 4 families varying political systems and roleplaying to boot it easily overgrows its money value want to make an city where women do nothing else but give birth to kids to prolong lineages you can and did you just see me contradict myself i bet you did as far as positive 5 is concerned want to make the ultimate balanced society you can want to be the best modern society you sure as hell can i absolutely love the amount of options this game gives me and for that  i thank it do you thats a question you need to answer for yourself

#####

it seems the developers have abandoned ship and stopped supporting the game after initial release it has a myriad of problems and is not worth the money buyer beware

edit they did return and update it with a patch plus some added content i still would not recommend in its current state but if the patches and work on it continue to make it workable i will glady change me review at that time

#####

so i read the reviews and thought nah it cant be that bad

it is believe the reviews the choices you make seem to have very little impact and the causality of 90 of the statistics peppered throughout are not remotely explained theres no mapping as to what actions favour which parties or inclination of any real difference to your characters influence around it

i ultimately gave up on my second attempted playthrough because it seemed nigh impossible to actually fathom out how to progress or improve anything in any meaningful name

#####

so this is another economic simulator by kalypso this one however is different for a change than most of their others the idea of being a mayor and trying to run and build a city while appeasing council members is a novel idea it does cause plenty of frustration when you are turned down on a proposal that will turn your city around from going to downhill but that is life i suppose the game has an advanced idea but a very simplistic implimentation of the game mechanics once you have figured out the way the game does things and why the council votes no on different things which almost always comes down to money the game becomes very easy being easy doesnt mean it is less fun though 

 i know i put a no for would i recommend this game which is kind of weird considering i do not think this game is bad nor do i think it has any game breaking bugs that makes it unplayable and all the bugs i have seen are so minor they are barely noticeable my only issue is the monotony of the gameplay after an hour or so and what happens in era iii going forward from there 

i only played for like 5 hours or whatever and i do not know if things change in the 5th era but the problem in era 3 being forced to use most of your party support to just get reelected instead of on proposals you support create an issue with gameplay you do no need to be elected the first 2 eras as you are appointed by the emperor but in era 3 you must run for election and convince the council to vote for you the same way you do for any proposal i spent far more support for the different parties in convincing them to vote me back in every 6 years than i ever could in advancing my city my city literally came to a stand still for anything the council didnt wholeheartedly agree with already

one top of this main problem that i think needs some balancing to help players i believe the game is not priced properly this game should be 1999 and at that price i would say it would sell two or three times as many copies more than making up the difference in price they are charging and i would recommend it to everyone but at this price point i think too many people would give up on the game after era 3 and feel ripped off on such an expensive game i really think these problems are extremely small on one hand but too big for more to ignore and recommend this game to anyone if kalypso were to get wise and price the game better and adjust how elections are handled from era 3 going forward i would put this game above nearly all other city builder sims


#####

anyone can build a city  not many can rule a city  fair warning this isnt another simcity or cities skylines  this is the political game behind the running of the city with a little smattering of city building and planning mixed in  where you would plan to build a police station and how to route roads was the bread and butter of city planning games  how to get the city to run effectively through city councel politics is this games focus  this also means that you have to learn the political game of schmoozing pleading walking the fine line between love and hate  and not making enemies

pros
 different approach to a genre that has recently enjoyed an upswing
 making friends and influencing people really has an impact on things versus just making money the primary factor in something failing or succeeding
 different political families present something to latch onto as the player  you are playing a role not just some invisible semigod making decisions about things affecting everyone else
 the different eras allow you to see how progress affects decisionmaking
 tooltips on many concepts allow you to grasp the games concepts without digging out a pdf manual or printing them off if you are pen and paper kind of ruler

cons
 some of the random events seem to not be well described  so choices seem arbitrary
 difficulty lacks granular controls to allow you to ease into this new hybrid genre of a game you either catch on and succeed or you dont  and you end up restarting when it all goes to 

i think the game would be worthy of a good 7078 approval rating  good roots but needs some smoothing over in spots to really make it a knockout  definitely worthy of the preorder cost a good choice with a small waitandsee recommendation at full retail price  kalypso always seems to iron out the wrinkles in their games and they will likely do so with this one as well  

just remember  ruling the city requires politics politics is playing nice with others if you dont play nice with others  this game is going to be really hard for you

#####

this game does not deserve the bad reviews it has been getting most reviews say this is a bad city builder but thats because this is not meant to be another sim city it has the political aspect to it which is a large part of the game

a bit expensive and a couple of very minor ui issues but all in all a solid game

#####

i was really hyped about this game when i first saw it but it turned out to be disappointing and overall i dont think its worth 40 euros my recommendation  play tropico instead it has better music too

1 the tutorial doesnt quite help in instructing what to do i was asked to create a new district but the proposal didnt go through so i had to wait some time to create the said district all peachy but now what ive played for 20 more years but no other popup to tell me what else to do and of course there was no goal mentioned anywhere however i couldnt fully utilise all the features because the institutions were locked even though ive researched both the port and train station so i had to start over the campaign

2 the map is not fully displayed not even as a minimap nor can you move around by moving the cursor to the edge of it so creating a new district or placing a service turns out to be quite hard to do since you have to right clickdrag to have visibility 

3 things get repetitive after a while  all you do is plead the council to approve your proposals and select choices on random events

4 technology vs city approvals  ok you have the electricity water and gas unlocked but your council is constantly refusing to adopt these technologies in the districts no matter how much you plead demand or threaten so whats the point of having them if you cant use them

5 no clear explanation on how the economy works you are just told in the tutorial that you can see the city data but thats all so you end up with bankrupt companies without explanation and the point mentioned above doesnt help either since the companies cant expandfunction due to the lack of resources 

i wish they had released an early access game at least to have the satisfaction of knowing theyll improve it 
think twice before you buy it

#####

so im really sort of on the fence with this game its built off a great concept and it runs smooth and looks good but i dont quite think 40 is the right price tag for this 

i have low playtime atm because im debating a refund again not because its necessarily a bad game but i just dont know if i see getting 40 worth of fun out of it if i decide to keep it ill update this review

__________________________________________________________________________________

played it a bit more and decided to keep it it really is more of a political simulator then anything else still not worth 40 in my oppinion but i dont regret keeping it

#####

i was very excited about this game coming out since it seemed to take away my least favorite part of citybuilder gameplay laying down every single street and water pipe and powerlines etc in this regard the game delivered on this expectation very well urban empire is aimed at the political side of managing a city and hence it allows you to be the mayor and relieves you of the burden of also being the town engineer subcontractor and surveyor this is a big plus for me and i enjoy how easy it is to build new districts and have control of the contruction of the city without being bothered by many small details

however i cannot recommend this game primarily for three reasons

firstly most of the edicts proposals and laws that are voted on by the city council are rather one sided with rare exception most of the lawsedicts only have good benefits for your city and no negative consequences sometime not even with any monetary expense either the edicts that do have a negative consequences often are very minimal negative effects and are greatly outweighted by the positive effects 

this leads to the political gameplay feeling very linear its like you are an omniscient mayor who knows that all of your ideas are great and they will all have good outcomes and your task is simply to get these nitwits on the city council to realize how good all these edicts and laws are for everyone and vote for them i find that this leaves the feeling that the gameplay and strategic element is lacking i would much rather have stronger positives and negatives for each edict this will greatly improve this aspect of our city but it will also cause equally big problems in this other regard i think it would also lead to the city feeling more specialized and have a uniqueness to it from one playthrough to the next

secondly this games lacks a good guide to the numbers behind the game and understanding why money or happiness is climbing or falling is often not clear and so making strategic decisions becomes frustrating because unseen variables appear to be affecting your city in unpredictable ways

thirdly you lose goodwill with politcal parties most anytime you encourage or cajole or persuade them how to vote on a particular issue but apart from some random events there isnt any consistent way to gain their goodwill so when your goodwill is low the only solution is to just talking to the parties until the goodwill rises back up to a normal level my problem with this is that it ignores the whole dealmaking and compromising side of politics while its true political parties often become strongly divided from each and will not have much goodwill for the other party at other times two rather different parties will come to an agreement to work together towards some mutual goal and will build up mutual goodwill to build up a stronger political bloc if this game had some element of negotiating between parties or building up goodwill through consessions and compromise then it would feel like an accurate political simulation

overall urban empire successfully delivers a macrolevel city building experience free of all the messy and frustrating detail work that most other city builders require unfortunately the onesidedness of most of the edicts and laws as well as the inablility to cooperate and build up goodwill with political parties makes the game feel scripted and most cities feel the same as the last city you built

#####

was worth a one time go through but it wasnt to great in all honesty city building looked interesting but the politics feels like everyones against you all the time feels like it tried to be a city builder with politics but failed on both parts had potential 

#####

first  lets make it clear this is not a city builder like cities skylines it is closer to democracy 3 

the concept of this game is a great one in my opinion though the execution is somewhat questionable

1 grab that cash and make a stash the biggest issue is value for money 43cad is a bit steep for the amount of content you get compared to the likes of lets say facturio which is 25cad 

2 same day different ruler iw done playthroughs with all the different families and all of their events are scripted and always the same there is no variation to the outcomes of the same options when you decide on an event furthermore the different families play pretty much the same in general with little variations

3 click and wait click and wait the council is more of an annoyance than a great game mechanic at this point it lacks any depth whatsoever there is little consequence in pissing off your rivals if good will goes negative the only thing is that your pleasdemandsthreats have less of an effect as opposed to when threatened causing massive opposition from them this seems to not happen furthermore there is no interaction with the parties on the council other than the voting

4 information boogaloothough the game has a myriad of info screens it somewhat lacks the ability to give you necessary information you have no way of knowing why businesses are doing poorly or why there are problems in certain areas the game has lots of visual cues that tell you something is wrong or happening but nothing to indicate why or what this is a problem since now you have very little info to figure out how to solve it

5 flash ahaaa fastest in the universe the pacing seems to be a bit off you can breeze through the 5 eras in 23h or so this makes the game more of a race to the finish rather than a sit down and rule your city type of deal if i were to compare it to crusader kings ii     

6 rule and drool since all the events seem to be scripted and there is no randomness or variety in the outcomes of your decisions the ruling aspect of the game gets old quite quick which is a big problem since the ruling mechanic is the main focus of the game to add insult to injury there is very little to do plop down a district raiselower taxes and pass a few edictsthats pretty much it there is very little political intrigue you can spy on parties but the result is the same you get dirt and use it to get the party to vote in your favoragain not a lot of depth

7 mayor the useless your character is a bit useless though you get some bonuses here and there there is again no depth or necessity for it unlike crusader kings where your ruler has a major impact on your countrys well being

in conclusion the idea is great but this game lacks any sort of depth whatsoever couple it with the 43cad price tag and value for money isnt there its sad as these types of games are my forte was hoping for a more complex city ruler rather than a mobile esque clicker 

the game has a lot of potential it just needs to be taped maybe with steamworks support and a lot of dlc this could evolve into something great we shall see what becomes of it 

if you want a city builder  this is not it
if you want a city ruler  this is not ityet
if you want a simple niche gameif the price doesnt concern you  give it a shot

#####

the most boring city builder i have ever played you sit there with speed on x4 watching your city grow with occassional issues popping up that you vote on  the issues are all common sense and it is far too easy to advance for instance  should we ban child labor of course should we work towards clean water of course should we build a railway of course i fail to see any real challenge thus far

#####

this is hot garbage the choices the game gives you has no actual bearing on the game you sit around waiting for the next decision that doesnt affect anything rinse and repeat even on a sale this game isnt worth it theres no playability to this whatsoever

#####

yawn  
there is no replayability in this game  actions have only a positive or negative impact  no complex decision making is required  max out lgbt rightsno backlash from the church  max out workers rightsno backlash from upper class  there is no balancing act  happieness of the population is so easy and never stands in the way of progress  

the entire goal of this game is to create a super tolerant socialist state as soon as possible  the game takes you down the same predictable path 
no real forks in the roads that you can take your nation to an industrial powerhouse or a hippy commune
no events that will shake up the landscape enough to reverse the path  

ive played 24 hours and have no desire to play again

#####

had high hopes for this game and preordered it realised there were quite a lot of game bugs and find the game boring good overall game concept and ideas but poor execution lack of replay value just keep on building new districts placing key buildings  and click on what invention to research next not recommended

#####

i really like the idea of urban empire trying to balance power in a parliament while building up your city empire is a great premise

and the game starts of well enough the graphic is nice and appropriate the basic economy seems logical and interactions with the parties are clear to handle scripted events give additional flavor and decision
you can plan out your city grow and advance
later eras increase the complexity step by step

but with more time with the game i cannot help but feel that there is something fundamentally amiss
its not easy to pinpoint there is not the one obvious thing that is broken it feels like the game is obfuscating its issues maybe unintentional it definetly lacks in clarity it does not feel that the developer had a clear user experience in mind the interface is clunky not very ergonomical and in some aspects not appropriate why are there no map overlays for coverages by infrastructure or services that is the standard in city builders since years
even worse is the instruction on the game inner workings explanations are lacking or confusing

in the end i wonder whever my decisions have any significant impact at all it feels meaningless

#####

i bought this when it first came out and i was hyped so hyped 

i felt horrible knowing i had to write this review eventually that i waited until now hoping the devs would release some redeeming content like hello games has recently i wanted this game to be good i really did but on top of all of the bugs and glitches there is one simple fact the gameplay is stale and repeats itself every 5 minutes but not the fun kind of repeating paradox provides no the kind where you dont feel involved in a world with people that have many different viewpoints and instead just want to fool game mechanics

i am sad for saying this but this game sucks

#####

i bought this game awhile back and played it for some time wasnt impressed then but dissappointed now this game was rather quickly dumped last development was mid last year free dlc update thats it the game is unpolished buggy midend game is slow i have an gtx 1080ti and i would constantly get 8fps and worst of all not worth the money i kinda feel like i got ripped off i did kinda like the idea of politics and etc but its too raw but i could see potential in that but if you are reading this and see mostly negative and are still considering to buy it then goddammit dont buy cities skylines with a few dlcs and its still worth more of ur money and a better gaming experience  

310

#####

i very rarely write reviews and i have never written a negative review
i have at the time of writitng this 44 hours in this game
the game has several issues they are

1 income to expenditure ratio seems off i am constantly having to raise taxes on my cities to ridiculous levels in order to provide basic amenidies i feel that this should have been tweeked slightly to make roads sewers and other infurstructure less expensive think about the fact that place cobble stone roads in a 4 block city cost almsot as much  in maintence and innital cost as a port or railroad

2 you have to grow fast in order to be able to afford to upgrade fast in my experience

3 a 4 district city can only support 5000 people in a medium density setting the population is generally very hard to grow and thereby income taxation is always lower than i would like the amount of population you get should be tweeked to be slightly higher

4 the interface for some of the politcal decisions doesnt work as intended for mayoral elections you have to go into the council screen and click several times in order to be able to affect your relection unlike other decisions that can be accesed through the city screen ie normal screen

5 you cant make people  not vote for a bill occasionaly parties in the council will try to lower taxes or introduce laws you cant sway people against these laws you can only sway parties towards passing them

6 mayoral elections and councils in most countries dont invole 6 different parties as the eras go on parties come and go but they also grow in number this goes against what happens in real world elections with 2 major parties and one or two minor ones added to this the parties dont seem to grow naturally the game just decieded who is in power and how many representatives they have i dont feel like i can actually change the popualtirty of parties very much the nazi party for example the justice party never passes any thing in my city nor does the christian party there supports should vote them out if they dont do there job while the communist and social democrats alway have legislation passed yet these dont seem to factor into elections

no party ever seems to gain a majority the highest is 4021 of the vote if i recal properly i get that this most likely so you have to get lots of parties to pass things but i just want to have the council debate while i make the city have running water and other cool things oh and universities

this game is based on a concept i hope is done some where else and is given more time and money then it will become a major success

i cant recommend this game as the concept is not fully realised and the blunders i find in the game make it a harder experience the game is not challenging its difficulty comes from it been not balanced correctly

#####

honestly this is a reluctantly negative review i like the idea i like the devs and i for the most part like the game but there are just too many little niggles

a list of negative things i noticed in no particular order
 the camera movement is strange it pivots on a point too far ahead of your view for my liking anyway
 the game lags badly as you get further into the game
 the game becomes repetitive and the challenges remain the same as you play through
  strikethere is little replay value as events always seem to have the same outcome so it becomes a more about memorisation than judgement strike
       i was wrong about this its not the case
 there is a lot of information but presented in a way in which its hard to keep a track of
 there is little to no contextual information or feedback when you make decisions
 the opposing political parties feel hollow the game is about balancing numbers but it shouldnt feel like it as you do it
 and weirdly the game hogs computer resources for some time after its shut down

this isnt to say its not worth considering its a marvellous idea much of it is well done the graphics are pleasant the game does well to make it feel like you are advancing through time the economic system is both detailed and robust and the technology tree is particulary well designed

i do like it but if i made the choice again whether to buy it id say no thanks


edit more niggles


 there isnt any way to locate a specific industry you can see if a district has it but either hovering over a factory type in the list needs to highlight them or else there at least needs to be some other way to find them rather than just clicking on every building until you find it
 in the scenarios there is little feedback to how well you are doing for example in the scenario where you have to build x amount of weapons to prepare for war there is no easily accesible feedback on how many you have actually made or at what rate you are making them
 minor events show up in the corner of the screen on a timer its easy to miss them if youre not looking at the bottom corner of the screen at the time

h1urban empire食之无味弃之可惜h1

h1我们在梦想与进步中长大h1

1820年皇帝赐了你一块地给了你500k的个人起始资金和1000k的城市资金作为城市的创建者从下手划分第一块行政区起你将要开始你的市长生涯而这个城市的名字你把它叫做kaisershafen要是你没改名的话

在最开始的阶段只能建造一个低密度仅有最基本的基础设施甚至连分区比例都无法自定义的行政区开始走向小城崛起的道路

kaisershafen的繁荣发展与别处是不同的他麻雀虽小但确人才济济什么热力学流行病学炸药电子游戏等等都将在这里被发明不要怀疑是虽然表面上是发展云但是研究完成一个之后会让你选择下一个发明想来诺贝尔开尔文这样的人物都蜗居在这个小城这样一个小地方何愁不兴旺发达甚至将来自己发射个卫星也不是不可以更难能可贵的是这里还是人权斗士的运动基地什么劳动法女权环保动保在这里都可以看到他们活动的身影性爱革命消除歧视这样的运动也是说发明就发明端的是世界何其大发展靠我家虽然kaisershafen在地球上占据了这么一个举足轻重的位置但是也不固步自封世界之大我市伸出友谊之手堪堪选出了6个未来入得了法眼的城市牛津旧金山悉尼圣彼得堡上海仙台虽不是首都strike但也横跨世界五大洲哦不少了个非洲strike

但先不急先把眼下这个小镇子经营好吧


h1钱钱钱h1

城市发展之本便是资金了如何让运营城市的成本低于带来的收益便是发展首要的问题

每建立一个行政区都需要额外的成本而人口的增长和行政区数量的关系尚不明确所以要慎重创建新的行政区在有需求的时候再建岂不稳妥得多发展的步子也不能迈的太大不能将无法承担的基建一股脑儿的往城区上般而要走一步看一步先找个试验田看看带来的收益能不能值回成本再考虑是否将这个推广

这本是一个城市发展的应有方式然而ue内部经济循环的不明确导致就算成本一时没有把握城市入不敷出眼看走向崩溃依然可以靠不断提高税率来弥补漏洞而此时本是用来制衡市长行为的议会居然也会用脚投票只要不结余太多的提税提案通通通过

也尝试过降低税率来观察是否能通过刺激消费带来收入的提升但结果是虽然有略微的提升但是效果远不如直接调节税率来的明显虽然高税率之下随处可见破产企业但是城市收入还是稳步提升人民也过得幸福如意简直匪夷所思

压榨人民制定高税率虽然日子当下过得有些紧但在研究完一项科技时代更替下收入能实现稳定的增长日进斗金不是梦正所谓降税容易提税难赶早变着法从市民手中抠钱才是硬道理


h1我最喜欢胁迫他人了h1

既然提到了议会那就不能不说说这个游戏的议会系统

由于前几个时代皇帝钦定了玩家来做这个市长完全不怕被弹劾也不怕有竞争者的出现本来用来制约玩家用来改变法案支持率的政治货币党派好感度尤其在不能跌破下限10的情况下其本身意义也然无存在好感度为正的情况下恳求非常有效一旦跌到负值那么胁迫反而变成了最容易的途径议会便犹如一个玩具任由玩家揉捏

就算是后期出现了竞选也无妨只要城市发展良好每两个月去稍微胁迫一下每个党派市长位置还不是手到擒来每6年一次的选举也不过就是消耗我政治货币的途径而已和之前已经不同

至于与经济相关联的提案只要城市日进斗金财务无忧不管有什么政治诉求这些党派都会无脑通过


h1我造的我来毁h1

随着城市的发展城市密度需要由低向高发展来容纳更高效率的住房工厂和商店然而在此之前已经建立的建筑物无法自动更新于是中后期拆迁需要科技解锁就变成了一项很常见的工程虽然看着一座座房屋轰然倒塌是一件很爽快的事情但是一个区域那么多建筑一个个点过来确实非常的累在没有框选和快捷键的条件下一个个选中建筑移动到右下角摧毁在到屏幕中间确认选择然后一片区域重复几十次是一件很傻b的事情

虽然拆迁需要付出一定的代价相应建筑物带来的利润也会随之失去但是之后新建筑慢慢拔地而起带来的利益也是明显的只是太繁琐的操作容易让人失去耐心所以我都是在区域比例分配那里先全选成住房确定改变区域后再全选为工厂提交改变用私人资金改后再手动分配比例反正改变区域比例不要钱所以用自己的钱也就不需要提案区域人员的安置赔偿都不用管虽然也要动好几下鼠标比一个个摧毁省力多了spoiler
虽然这样就不能解锁拆迁成就了spoiler


h1自由平等博爱h1

关于人权的问题一直以来都是现实生活中争议颇多的地方在这个游戏中也是琳琅满目的提案有些就算放到当前来看也是尚未实现比如同工同酬同性婚姻合法化等等非常的pc倒是我喜的部分


h1退化完成h1

最后说说这个游戏其他方面的质量

游戏汉化不易但是这个汉化的质量确实有点垃圾比如前文提到的发展和发明指的是同一个东西比如少数名族的同性恋问题再比如将lgbt翻译为同性恋再比如本段标题的退化完成而英文原文是downsizing done而只在科技完成时出现的原本就不多z中文语音中我竟然还在其中听到了一条英文语音不过我倒是忘了记下是哪一段没玩过游戏就翻译以及缺少统筹校对是很多已有汉化的通病这个游戏汉化该有的也都有


游戏本身其他的硬伤也不少

1流程单一一个家族就是一个既定的事件没有重复玩的价值三张战役地图大同小异也就是地形稍有区别反而是三个挑战还有那么点意思
2优化烂游戏进行到后期卡的不行载入及保存时间长常常未响应让人以为程序崩溃玩着玩着程序崩了的情况也有发生过
3内部经济逻辑不清前面已经提及进入下一个时代只不过就换了个接班人收入却猛的增加着实让人捉摸不透
4成就系统混乱不堪目前成就各种张冠李戴
5画面嗯感受一下高楼大厦吧


h1乐观者说这玻璃杯里有一半是满的
悲观者说这玻璃杯里有一半是空的
工程师说这玻璃杯只要有原来的一半大就够了h1

同样的一句话送给这个游戏这游戏内容看似丰富实则浅尝辄止壳子只要有现在的一半就够了当然如果你是乐观者可以玩一玩

#####

i dont understand the negative reviews if you like the other kalypso games and youre willing to learn how the game works you should enjoy it

if you want to stray significantly from the flow of history play tropico this game has a predetermined path following historical events you build your districts around the free land plan zoning and manage infastructure 

on my 3rd start of my first playthrough i beat the game after 30 hrs or so of slow tidy gameplay 

i enjoy this and im restarting to focus on different ideologies and ruling strats

#####

very good but not for beginners

urban empire is an economic history strategy build m up

if you expect something like simcity you probably are frustrated cos you cant build buildings like you want

paradox makes mavels strategy games and so it is 

you learn a lot about the last 200 years in europe from the view of a founding city

its a challange and for more advanced economic strategy players 

from my perspective an awesome game in a line of very good srategy games by paradox

dont forget it has a saving function use it before you start new projects in your city

the many negative reviews are not justified except you just whated to build a fancy city

if you have played europe universal you might know the difference between paradox strategy games

and othes 

rock it 



#####

i saw all the negative reviews and got scared away i just got the game on sale and man its a lot of fun its a politics simulation and a pretty good one at that

#####

developers abandoned it after a year or so dont get it

#####

oh dear i preordered this game the moment i heard of it what a great concept whenever i played simcity or cities skylines i always thought  somethings missing mayors are not dictators theyre constrained by constantly changing political circumstances and harassed by often viscious opposition parties so a city game with the political element sounded ideal unfortunately i dont think ive ever been more disappointed by a game

the developer clearly had a great idea but then struggled to realise it the result is a flat onedimensional game that offers no depth either as a city builder or as a political simulator the city building bit is ridiculously simplistic  drag and drop your district and boom youre done the political simulation is equally simplistic you want something ask the city council for it and then influence the parties  ie perform the same repetitive clicks over and over again  until they let you have it its too easy

the different parties have no depth to them i dont get the impression of dealing with a complex roiling mass of confliciting political ambition like an actual city council would be you dont even get to know the names of the party leaders  which is odd as the game is supposedly characterdriven theyre just sort of there the bias towards socialist policies is also obvious and irritating

game mechanics are frustrating too the only thing you can really do to actually build your city apart from place districts is place services these are crazy expensive so you cant place many and rather than their effectiveness being tied to how many people can reach them on the street  like most services in cities skylines for example  theres a ridiculous radial influence that just leads you to bunch everything in the centre where it will reach more people

graphics too are poor there isnt a feeling of a living breathing city but of a dull slow collection of pixels

i could go on but in short  save your money also  35 jog on my only hope is that now this idea is out there some other developer will turn it into a worthy game

#####

still a mess barring a few hotfixes the developers have made no attempt to fix or improve their game since launch a wasted opportunity and a mark against kalypso who published if not developed it  i foolishly expected a level of polish to match the tropico games

#####

unbelievable over 1 month after release and no patch for all of the errors highlighted in these reviews

i love tropico but this is outrageous i would not recommend this game for over 5 as it currently stands it needs serious fixing luckily the majority of the fixing is easy  but for some reason there hasnt been a word out of the dev team for this or any hotfixes

#####

had high hopes but overall this game just seems lackluster you spend way too much time waiting on counting votes screen even when the outcome is obvious ievery single decisioni in the game has to be voted on by the council that much is fine but having to wait at a counting votes screen for all 60 members to vote every single time is painstakingly boring 

moreover after 3 playthroughs i never felt like i got a grasp on how the economy works at all it wasnt selfevident in the slightest and i could never get a stable cashflow and i was clueless as to what was going wrong

on two of my playthroughs i couldnt even make it to the end of the game one in particular was frustrating because all the different citizen needsdesires on the wheel of life were all positive i was making everyone happy and had a huge treasury reserve with a positive cash flow and suddenly the council voted me out as mayor which immediately ends the game these kinds of interactions where stuff doesnt go as youd expect and theres just no way to make sense as to why things are happening that way plague the game there is a tutorial mode but it doesnt do a good job at explaining the underlying economy supplydemand or any of that

additionally the political simulation seemed like it was on rails the council would recommend something like ability for citizens to form corporations and the vote would fail the next month theyd suggest it again and the vote would fail this would go on for byearsb and every time it pauses your game and you have to watch the counting votes screen

as for feeling like i was my own mayor i was really disappointing in how that worked probably from my own lack of understanding how the game was designed i thought that bib could be a mayor but in this game thats not the case rather you play already created characters with their own backstories and agendas you can make small tweaks here or there but i was saddened by the lack of customization for lack of a better work which kept me from feeling immersed in the sim

#####

im astonished to see this game only has 46 positive i think this is one of my favorite games to come out recently the dynamics are unique at least as far as anything i have played goes and i really enjoyed them unfortunately i think this is a niche game

i had a brief look at some of the gripes and complaints most of them center around not having control well thats just the thing folks in politics mayor or not you do not have all the control at best you have some sway and a bully pulpit to try and influence things i think what these folks are looking for is yet another simcity and i have news for those people this aint it

to the company that makes this game id say please do not be dismayed the direction you are going in makes sense and does actually produce a fun game it is unfortunate that so many people here dont enjoy it but i think that largely is because they were expecting something else entirely

i enjoy politics in real life and that is what attracted me to this game i really really hope the devs continue to work on it and update because in spite of this measley 46 rating i honestly think the game is awesome and definitely fun its just unfortunate that so many people who were expecting something else decided to brigade the games steam rating 

i saw a mention of graphical resolution problem to which i cannot speak but that is certainly fixable i have had no such performance of graphical problems but i have an i7 6700k 32gb of 3000mhz ram and a seahawk gtx 1080 so you know i damn well better not have any issues lol

anyway great game a really good political simulator not so much a city simulator it is definitely something different and i really enjoy the crap out of it 





this game absolutely does not deserve the red letters of awful rating youre seeing first thing first also youre right capslock forever anyway

i cant believe this game got a negative review because a bunch of complete fucking gamer morons couldnt handle the fact this had some lightweight parliamentary mechanics built into

so return it you unbelievable fucking whiners thats not the right way to whine about stuff at all watch me next time 

nah but its a great game it does something not nearly enough devs are trying to do which is government and political simulation nationstate larger and smaller i am so incredibly driven nigh on fucking mad because for the longest ive had a fairly detailed idea the creation of just such a game of course i know the fine nuance of game development like i do higher mathsz wa wait no rather like i dont have a goodamn clue about anything in excess of basic bitachi weeprealgebra and multiple attempts to learn further have rendered hella bust so ok well anyway the point is how it is maddening to have an idea that i can tell has something to it unlike a lot of the shovelware i see on steam lately and to not be able to get it out of my damn head like how can that ego of mine fit out here in the wild but wee ol very special project cant reality is a fucking rhinocock choker for change man

its a good game ah this one for the review or whatever i mean mine too but well just cue a frustrated intermittent volume increase of cursing for the next few moments and try this one

i promise if congressparliamentary mechanics determining a lot of stuff you can and cant do sounds like it has the potential to make things interesting get this  what a shame people couldnt love it proper

whoooooooooooooops already wrote that 

this game is fantastic ignore the whiners it runs fine on modern hardware and worst case scenario return it quickfast badda bing it is so worth a try too if you wanna develop something like it because it has a lot of worthwhile tricks to see for yourself


katherineftw feb 18 2017  1135pm 
you fail to realize why we hate the game


hun i grasp why you hate it just fine but if you wanted a city builder go play a city builder leave a game thats trying to do something fresh the all hell alone and not review bomb it that is lame shit how many fucking city builders are there on steam christ someone does something new and they catch all this fucking shit for it and well gee why is originality so hard to come by well that kinda attitude definitely factors not you personally but that attitude amplified en masse towards things that take something typical and make it fresh

props to the dev take every whining negative review bomber as a compliment yall had the right idea go scope out how suzerain is killin it pretty big departure but that role in simulation has real promise

regards to ya katherine i hope you found one to suit right disagreements and such aside o

#####

a unique entry in the strategy genre urban empire incorporates many great ideas into a solid political simulator your goal is to hold your esteemed position and grow your influence over severaly generations of your family dynasty you will be deciding on the direction of the city by dealing with the varying and evolving political parties forging alliances and making rivals as you progress the one caveat that must be understood upfront is that in order to enjoy this game you must not go into it believing that it is primarily a city builder like simcity cities skylines or tropico it is first and foremost a political simulator with city building being one of the aspects that you deal with during the course of it

progression in the game is quite interesting every generation has its own narrative choices to make some of them affecting the political landscape some affecting the physical city and some personally affecting your character and their family replayability is enhances as there are several families to choose from which all have their own unique family members personal stories strengths and weakness

each era has its own set of political parties that you must deal with at first there are few and they are relatively easy to balance as times goes on these parties split into varying ideologies new parties form and old parties die off each party has its own set of values and expections for your actions and the choices that you make will impact your relationships with them good luck pleasing them all though as just like in the real world they are often seeking resolutions on the issues that directly oppose one another 

now onto the elephant in the room the city building the city building in urban empire is actually quite deep and engaging however its very much a slow burn and you engage in it a fraction of the time that you would with a more directly city building oriented game each expansion is a political ordeal and is done in districtsized chunks adding a new neighborhood can be a challenge as can adding street lights quality roads and even utilities to an already existing one these can be complicated by your current standing with the political parties who en masse have the power to utterly veto any changes that you seek to make if youre slipping up in your political game 

urban empire is a game that i have thoroughly enjoyed it is not a city builder in the classic sense and i believe thats why so many have reviewed it negatively it does not resemble what you are expecting if you go into it with that mindset and the game will seem slowpaced and overly challenging i do not recommend it to those specifically looking for a cities skylines experience however i very much recommend it to those willing to go into it with an open mind as they will be able to find an excellent deep political experience with a unique combination of mechanics and narrative choices that i have yet to find anywhere else

#####

dont waste your money on this game  it is rushed and buggy
not a major patch since game release and no response from devs or mods about any further support

#####

while this game looks goodbox art so to say it has many many problems that have yet to be addressed by the developers kalypso media 

the first main problem is the communication this game has with the player while you have a shiny tutorial which most games nowadays gloss over the way the game tells you waht is going on is not clear multiple typos appear regularly and what you are changing at times through edictsetc is not clearly indicated to the player

another major problem with this game is the reset upon reloading if you are able to even get your system to respond to the commands especially in later eras
the preformance of this game is pitiful at best even if you do find a way to get it up and running on your system expect major preformance issues especially again in later eras as your city continues to grow 

this game feels like it was pushed way to quickly through to the public without taking simple steps to make it the best game that could of come onto the market to us the players i can not recommend this game to anyone especially for 3999 usd as of time of posting even at a sale of 50 i wouldnt touch this product while fun the bugs and preformance issues will give you buyers remorse for weeks 

kalypso media has many great games under their belt the tropico series and airline tycoon 2 come to mind but this game is not one of them and brings to mind the easimcitydisaster13 and we all know how that turned out

#####

they never finished the game in my opinion and it has been abandoned for years now  it would have been nice if they gave us dlcs and polished the game  i guess kalypso is on only good at the tropico franchise and even that game is the same installment after installment

#####

the tldr version is below

i did try to like the game but is rather uninnovative
you create a district which is a combination of 3 zones like in simcity industrial economical and housing you can divide it by  but by default its 60 housing 10 econ and the rest industrial
you can like in other games add buildings to service the needs eventually upgrade the districts and its density etc

the main thing about the game  political choices basically to do most of the things you need to convince the ever increasing ammount of parties they listen to you when you use convience options like pleads or threats

only  there doesnt really matter which you use
and secondly  as long as you have money and dont want to pull a bill that will put you in the red too much they will agree to most things

even further  getting services for your districts will ruin you so you just cash in on them and only get the ones that boost industry
than once you have enough cash you just build another district rinse and repeat

repeat is the key word in the game while you do upgrade researches most of the things seem rather passive with other upgrades beeing simply too expensive to be viable at all electricity should in theory make your rich right but in practice it doesnt translate that way
but brushing that aside you eventually can afford the stuff later if for whatever reason you want it nothing ever changes
the city doesnt feel alive at all everything is a made up stat with no consequence only cash generation matters you dont do anything almost

there is only voting which is even more repetetive all you do is move the parties on a slider with same options every time

it begins rather okish but the more you play the game the more tired you become and less rewarding it gets

during the campaign the main character changes to its progeny but that happens from era to era changing your portrait and few passives there are some scripted bills that reflect on the changes in history like child labour womens rights etc and they seem to be scripted  on first go everyone just opposes them and you have little change to win later no matter what everyone simply has a change of hearth and supports it its entirely pointless and only exists for flavour giving you the illusion of having some part in it

_____________________________________________
tldr version

its boring

#####

interesting concept and much potential sadly the implementation is bad and there are too few detailed information to manage your city efficiently

510

#####

this game had such potential but overall i was left feeling very ripped off if the developers could just make some tweaks to the gameplay it could be so much better nothing is explained finances are impossible to manage on the plus side it looks great has a great concept and the political side is interesting a few adjustments to make it more fun would make this a positive review from me

#####

promising but flawed very little feedback on what is happening and the effects of your policies many aspects of the game are not documented at all could be good with some tweaking but not a 30 game

#####

the game need more balancing and ways to manage the city its good but not a great city builder game

#####

only good if your idea of a fun city simulator involves spending hours and hours badgering your town council to get approval for anything to be done all while managing a constant cycle of debt and negative earnings

so in other words something a little too close to actual municipal politics

#####

i just dont think its worth the 40 maybe 20 i like the game and the concept feels shallow needs to be felshed out someome i would like to use personal funds and city funds to build like a halfhalf combo i would also like more info on some screens more parties and the growth of the number of people in parties as in population growth more grid options diffrent mayor governments would be nice overall its fun but i felt like i was doing the same thing everytimealso mod support would make this game amazing 

ps people are mad that i think the price is too high i like the game just needs more stuff for that price

#####

i started this game full of hope which this game drowned in a shallow puddle

video
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvi8jom1kkpk

text
as always watch the video for a much more detailed analysis 

urban empire looks pretty  that much is uncontested the various time periods design choices and distinct detail in every nook and cranny ooze personality from character art to research screen everything looks fantastic it also has pretty good pc performance with no dips below 60 at any time and smooth gameplay on any level of zoom

sadly this performance is achieved in part by just having almost no simulation of life in the town street look empty sounds are subdued when available and everything just moves at a snails pace that doesnt really fit with the month per tick cycle of the game 

but its not the visuals that make this game bland its the gameplay between having very limited information that has almost no detail or depth and very limited control over the city building that makes it for a very hands of and very frustrating experience not being able to assign districts directly and not being able to build your infrastructure beyond a draw a box call it a district and yay is not that fun and more than that  everything is ridiculously expensive that keeping a solid balance is nigh on impossible oh and keeping your economy running doesnt matter anyhow there are no consequences

also the expected political gameplay boils down to a sliderbar with a score on top the expected depth of political gameplay or intrigue really never shows up and all voting boils down to is how often youve done one of 3 random events

also almost anything is put to the vote but by and large the parties dont really oppose you in any way with neither real counter plays or divergences in ethics being apparent in their pervote look at things and nothing you do will have any long or even mid term impact

overal a shallow experience that fills a few hours before you crave either city building or political gameplay and it provides neither in any real way



#####

great idea i really wanted to like it terrible execution the game is horribly unbalanced once you adopt the political views of a teenager making the right choice has nothing but benefits making the wrong choice has nothing but consequences need more money because youve never balanced a budget in your life thats okay you can just increase taxes indefinitely the citizens are happy to fork over their salary car house dog children arm and leg so that you can build that new neighbourhood

#####

hy guys just thought ide write a review ill also add a link to a compleated time victory video review at the bottom for anyone who cares to view it  i did a lot of reading of reviews on here prior to purchasing this game and nearly did not purchase it because of them however i loved the idea and concept of this game and decided to buy it anyways im extreemly glad i did this game in no way in my opinion deserves such a negative review i beleive people are buying this game thinking its a city builder and its not and never have the developers made out it is they have declared from the start its a city managment game  and i find the game to function well in the catagory its designed so i guess my main point here is read the negative reviews by all means i read them as well but if this game is something you think you will enjoy watch some reviews and game play and make your own mind up cause i no i nearly didnt get this because of some terrible reviews that i now dont beleive to be justifiable and im glad i purchased this ide be annoyed if i hadnt just on reviews here on steam if you are still skeptical buy it on sale you wont regret it especially on sale  httpsyoutubevpmmcjcvdyu

#####

a lackluster game that tries to be both a citybuilder and a politcal sim it fails to be good at either of those

#####

game is dead do not buy no updates and the game is still broken

#####

as a lover of the tropico series i went against the reviews and bought the game on sale for around 10 frankly i think the game is not finished but has some great ideas  i wouldnt ant to pay more for it than what i did

good points
 like tropico there is a great dynamic between different areas of the game research in particular many moving parts to manage and so many stats to sink your teeth into the writing is in true tropico comedic style with a couple easter eggs thrown in
 the politics workokay in principle again the idea is great and works well at times in certain repeated scenarios though the game ties your hands with unworkable parties i like the favourappeal system though which does allow you to get around some tricky situations
 the city builder is againok its clunky but does the job its fairly simple
 
bad points
 on that note finance its really hard to keep your finances up and often completely unclear as to why some districts perform well when others dont you try to upgrade your districts within the slim margins you have but you inevitably end up sinking into the red i will keep trying different ways and update on this
 as mentioned above the politics can get predictable and theres a particular scenario farright stronghold that makes it really hard to get anything done this impacts finance and city development a lot wasting loads of time
 it took me a while to work out that the special buildings port train etc are the only way to keep your bank balance afloatfor a bit
 the game is buggy it crashes a lot which might explain the frequent autosave some actions dont correspond to the result and its really unclear how certain decisions impact trade often you get 3 choices but can only see the results of 2 in advance bug 

tldr if you liked tropico you might like this because it contains the same humour its a good idea as a game id love to play a finished version one day 510

#####

tldr this game is a indirect city management game with politics that takes some time to figure out and is deceptively complex

this is a fairly unique management simulation

you are a mayor who is one of several stereotypical dynasties who has been granted control of a city

you take no direct hand in building it but must manage the city indirectly though successful political maneuvering of the council

the game has a very familiar citybuilderesque cycle
1 choose and object to build
2 wait for budget to be positive enough to sustain it
rinse repeat

it adds a few other things to the cycle
petition the council for funding of your project or fund it yourself
intorduce laws and get them passed

in between all this you must regularly make decisions on various events both random and othewise presented to you these events can have bigger consequences than they first appear

early on in this game i felt like all the options they give you in manageing the political parties were just different shades of the same flavor but the political system is actually much more subtely complex than i thought

another thing that ended up being more interesting than it first appeared is the economy

if you enjoy games like crusader kings 2 victoria 2 really any paradox grand strategy or grand strategy games in general you will probably like this game if you want an outlet for your creative outbursts this will probably end up frustrating and boring you

#####

the biggest problem is the game slows to a crawl the last 25ths of the game  the last era is particularly slow even scrolling the map is lagged and jittery  its really bad

conceptually some of the politics is a little weak  for example nylon for bras literally in the game is right up there with the steam engine and the electrical grid cosmetics as well  cosmetics will literally do as much for women as electricity  

there is no downside to higher taxes  for example i have industry taxes at 50 but still have highest demand for industrial zones possible in the game  in the game its silly not to raise taxes all the time to pay for city services which incredibly enough can provide and solve everything your populace could ever want  nor is there really an upside to lower taxes one era i put commercial taxes at 5 and the next era back up to 35 i didnt have time to get them all the way up to 50theres no difference  judging by the steam discussions i think other players have struggled with this disconnect from reality as well

the majority of choices have no downsides i want to say all choices but some have a minor cost  none  which really robs the game of any strategy

the game is supposed to be a mayor political simulator but i can probably count on one hand the number of times the council didnt just rubber stamp by which i mean an overwhelming majority whatever issue i wanted them to vote on  the only restraining factor was you can only press one kind of issue at a time taxation district upgrade etc and it takes 3 months to a 1 year to get them to vote  honestly the mayor race was the only consistent issue that required me to do anything

you can have the highest possible city happiness low unemployment etc etc and even as the incumbent during elections most political parties will favor the challenger forcing you to use up your political capitalwhich you may as well because you never really need it

every single improvement for every single district requires a majority vote  i get it its a mayor simulator but lets say you want to introduce high speed internet to your city  by this point you will have over 20 districts you need to go to each district upgrade it and then wait because each vote requires at least 3 months if you use prestige to force a vote as soon as possiblefor each and every district one at a time  there are about two dozen or so upgrades so most of the time youre just shoving through a handful of improvements at a time because you dont have time for anything else especially in the last two or three eras there are five

if you build every city service building so that every district has coverage from every service or nearly about half or more of all your available space will be city service buildings

you cant select where you want a districts residential commercial or industrial zones to be

#####

buy this game asap if its on sale 

i really dont understand all the negative reviews for this game
decent price for some great fun

the game is something different aiming at the more political aspect it isnt too deep so everyone will get hold of it people who are into politics like myself might get disappointed as it isnt too detailed and deep but i had low expectations

overrall the game is good id give it about 710 really fit my taste  i love simulator games aswell as politics

#####

played 8 hours i can most definately say this game is not finished many minor bugs and simple things left out of the game like undo buttons or easier ways to lay out districts dont get me wrong it works but its not perfect the game overall though i can already say is boring and repetative  yes you can change families and start new games make new laws and do things differently ultimately your doing the same thing over and over on the same land and cant truly expand a big city as the land is extremely restricted same size as the starting block on cities skylines without buying other land to expand so its small  hopefully they will be active in making changes to the game so i can change this review was expecting more

#####

this game is not worth it got to era 3 and then everything broke the vote button in the council did not work anymore could not progress and there is no way the devs are going to fix it now as they abandoned it quickly after release in 2017

the game is promising but the ammount of bugs in this game is appaling and it became not even playable dont even buy for 2 euros let alone for the full price just not worth it



#####

good concept poorly programmed three months after release and this malfunctioning turkey still hasnt had a decent bug patch ill never buy another reborn game again they should rename themselves dropped dead

#####

im shocked to see so many negative reviews of this game it doesnt say it was trying to be cities skylines or simcity 
this game is exactly what it says it is and it has an interesting a fresh take on a city strategy game 

i started playing this game a few years ago and it is a really good game overall

#####

i find this game very entertaining the replayability is kind of limited but is still fun regardless i wish the developers would have spent a little more time on this game because i love the concept so much and you can tell they got tired of working on it regardless i still encourage anyone interested in city building to give this a try

#####

invested some hours and prepurchsed
i really wanted to like this game if i could give a neutral recommendation i would had lots of potential but seems to be incomplete just missing something  the effects of technology research to actual city growth are extremely disappointing you basically have to destroy an entire district for any results in taxesproduction really cool concepts and maybe after a patch or extra dlc itd be worth a go 
bottem line wait for 50 sale

#####

good concept but poor performances in the later eras of the game playing becomes very tedious due to the game running very slow

#####

in general loved the idea but execution is poor as only it could be 

community was enthusiastic for this game i myself was very positive upon release and seeing dev team interest in bugs being reported game required a lot of additional work but it seemed we will make it better however sweet beginning lead to bitter end 

devs basically abandoned the game amount of bugs and issues with optimalization in late faze making game unplayable as priority that would require significant work most likely made them jump of the ship and pretend this game did not exist

taking this into consideration and absolutely unforgivable behavior of kalypso i suggest being very cautious when thinking about buying their game in case of urban empire i feel cheated and if i didnt give the game some credit hoping for improvement i would definitely request refund from steam 

dont buy it at current state it is unplayable and way overpriced it is not worth more than 56 with quality you get


#####

its a straight up mix between the civilization series and simcity with the events of tropico large tech tree as well as delegation options allowing for permanent benefits of various industries trade deals allowing for permanent bonuses to buildings love the simplicity in city building and upgrades  dont have to physically build tram lines etc as well as politics set ways how to pursuade people to agree to your stance around 20 parties throughout history with varing reactions great charcter development and family progression  4 generations later my son was a pessimist a loner and cruel due to the choices i made with various events of his predecessors financial management can be an issue and yes you will have to raise taxes to 60 if thats what will keep you going one minus the victory conditions arent clearly available  atleast i was unable to locate them but perhaps this is simply my incompetence  i love this game it fills a void of  the need for more tropico like games 

#####

interesting concept but horribly unpolished and unrefined end product

#####

a game for a leader not for a god
all in all this is quite a good game if you understand what it is so be warned this game is not a typical citybuilding game and its not that intuitive either youre not god in this game youre supposed to be the mayor of your city this means that you can not just randomly arrange your city without consequences youll have to make logical political decisions about your city instead  meaning youll have to please your citizens and political collegues with the setup of your city or they wont endorse your next decision service or quarter and even upgrades for every district this aspect of having to deal with opposition and how the different districts interact can sometimes feel like a bother it might slow down the pace for you but youll have to consider when you play your political cards or you become a tyrant in the opinion of your councel and eventually end up stuck with no cooperation whatsoever and  having nothing to do but watch everything fall apart of course youll hate this game then the political and economical aspect however does make this game a lot more realistic than traditional citybuilders having said that you do still have partial freedom to spend your own income however you want you might want to save your own funds for emergencies though because for the whole of the rest of the counsel youll have to make sense somehow with the layout of your city and find the compromizes for example to collect the taxes needed to survive the next economic crisis or boom all set in a sandbox historical timeframe when it all works out for you this game is quite enjoyable though and not nearly half as bad as some think it is

#####

family dynasty founds glorious city and leads it into a golden age 
citys citizens enjoy universal free education and health care 
citys citizens watch ww 1 happen from their air conditioned apartments on their satellite tv while eating microwave dinners 
city enjoys more money in the bank then the whole of the austrian empire 
family dynasty is voted out because they would not ban contraception 

610  would repress the christian party again


its on the verge of being a decent game however most of the mechanic are shallow in regards to actual game play it basically plays itself requiring little thought and repetitive actions little depth to the political game with very few ways to influence the political parties 
there are a lot of great concepts in the game however none of them are flushed out or have any real impact

reconmend waiting to it buy on sale

this review will be updated as more information is gathered updates at bottom

tl dr in a game espousing political wrangling manipulation and development there is only one political path available and it will happen whether you pursue it or not the other parties will eventually pass every edict that is beneficialrequired unions child labour laws etc without any need for input there are no significant historical decisions to make as history is singletracked so no althistory fun your decisions are irrelevant and coercing the political parties is pointless anyways because there is only one outcome no matter who you play as tropico had more political influence and shaping than urban empire does

the tropico from the 1990s 


normal review follows
the citybuilding element of this game is simplistic not bad and a little awkward at times having to modifyimprove infrastructure on each small district individually its serviceable given that the game is focused on the political landscape

unfortunately this is where the game from what ive seen so far falls flat playing a technocratic mayor i found that the only social progress i would ever meaningfully make was towards the ideals of the modern left nearly all of the conservative ones seemed to have drawbacks whereas liberal ones were purely beneficial why would this bother me given that i am for want of a better term liberal because there was no teeth to the opposition there was no temptation the populace inevitably voted leftwing and thus all edicts were effortlessly passed to support their policies while the conservative groups languished ineffective in the background was it because i educated my populace that they so overwhelmingly supported such efforts its impossible to tell since education is required just to keep the population content

to compound matters a selling point of the game is marching onward through the eras with the political tribulations that followed unfortunately these matters seem to have almost no impact on anything you do ingame a recession hit and i lost some income but recovered regardless the emperor was deposed and fled to my nation but no apparent benefits drawbacks or gameplay mechanics followed russia gets invaded by bloody france and there is no evident impact on my city theres no althistory as has been confirmed by others and there doesnt seem to be any way to influence politics or even be influenced _by_ politics at least from what i have currently seen

next playthrough well see if a nationalistic luddite will actually change the way the game goes or if its all just kicking and screaming into the mundane future without regard for the possibilities that would emerge from quirky althistory antics




so far so bad only way to progress is through unions rights etc spent the entire first two parts of the campaign resisting unions despite them having no mechanical downside and i believe being absolutely necessary to upgrade your economyincome but ultimately its futile 

while you can use underhanded means to usurp other political parties there doesnt seem to be any reason to do so over time theyll want to pass various laws that will only improve your societyincomeetc as previously stated these edicts are almost exclusively leftleaning and there are no means to say create a human rights abusing society like china 

in a game where the entire draw is the political wrangling and manipulation why is there only one political route to pursue that offers any success and is met with minimal resistance regardless of which parties you court hell the conservative or just abusive policies i try to set offer me little but political gain with the party i already associate with while the liberalhuman rights ones give political capital popularity and economic advantages

i feel like im railroaded into playing the game only one way despite having four dynasties a tthe start which too are preset and the tagline being the option to influence decisions such as womens rights and child labour there is literally no reason to oppose any of it whether you pick the human rights advocate or the techhating luddite conservative it all ends the same way and trying to change it does nothing but prolong the inevitable

urban empire espouses choices that matter but so far none of my choices matter

#####

a refrishing swim in a shallow pond

pros
 very few titles in the genre
 what it does mayoral simulator it does well
 peaceful layed back gameplay
 runs well and looks as good as it needs to be

cons
 not a lot going on there are times where youre just waiting for the time to tick by
 the games politics definitely tend to lean one way moreso than the other
 difficult to tell what choices makes what changes

neutral
o shallow gameplay you make choices and hope you have enough clout to sway votes to your side thats pretty much it in a nutshell
o there definitely seems to be an optimal way to go about advancing your city and districts

its a difficult genre to make a game for as the demand is quite low personally i love these types of games and there are very few additions every year that are worth checking out the problem here is that to appeal to a wider audience they tap into city building and planning elements that are just too shallow for those looking for a city builder if you know what youre getting into before buying it should scatch that proverbial mayoral itch

#####

this game is awful  nice concept but this is not a finished game  i dont know how kalypso has not released a significant patch for this yet  unplayable at this point  

ill be wary of kalypso in the future

#####

i bought this game looking forward to a new take on city builders the idea of adding political elements to gameplay is great however this game feels to me like a monotonous job the elements are there but there is no depth at all other than balancing surplus via taxes and cost via new city districts and upgrades there is nothing to this game i did watch some lets players review this game and they all liked it so did i but only for the first few hours which coincidently is the same amount of time put into this game by the lets players this game has the foundation and is nice on the surface but after a few hours you realize wow i really hope i didnt play too much to not get a refund

i did get a refund

#####

i have put several hours in this game but out of the 83 hours most of those took place where i was afk i was very excited for this game to come out it is right in my wheelhouse for games that i love to play unfortunately urban empire falls way short of my expectations the game is incredibly boring and does not feel like a finished product this is not a 4000 game if you have some interest i would recommend waiting till a 50 off sale and do not go afk for hours after onehour you will be returning the game
disappointing experience  i would not recommend
im sure after many dlcs which kalypso is notorious for the game will be average and they will have 80 of your hard earned money
steam should be ashamed that they let their customers be taken on a game of such poor quality

#####

as someone who is obsessed with government simulation and strategy games i saw this game and immediately preordered it i watched numerous videos of gameplay and it appeared to be just my cup of tea upon release and several hours of playtime i feel as though ive had my fill not 34 worth but a fill 

the initial era is perhaps the most enjoyable portion of the game it feels busy turbulent just as you begin your cityin other words it feels as though you are truly engaged in creating a city executing its policy improving infrastructure et ceterahowever after the inital issues are settled it slows down significantly oftentimes you find yourself barely making enough money to pay for simple improvements like gravel to cobblestone roads and virtually never are able to increase taxes unless the deficit is immense and even then it can be a struggle by about era iv you end up focusing less on improving and expanding your city through public works projects and legislation and far more on simply hoarding goodwill so that you can sway the parties each time a mayoral election comes around perhaps its user error or perhaps simply a reflection of the reality of politics 

though at first i noticed a trend towards more leftwing parties and policies having a sort of inevitable quality to them which mind you i do not mind being a very liberalleftwing person myself the reality of it is that no matter how much you support these parties such as supporting their legislation or merely being cordial to them they almost always end up stabbing you in the back by the time elections come aroundive found myself having no other choice than to threaten the parties in order to remain in office by the later eras

on the more technical aspects the game itself is goodlooking though draw distance is far shorter than it should and the graphics though perhaps not revolutionary are fitting and the visuals do not leave me disappointed in the slightest the game runs very smoothly on my pc despite it not being necessarily a ultrapowerful machine on the highest settings overall i have encountered no gamebreaking bugs or issues that have ruined the gameplay simply because of developer error on that same note responding to popup events is in many ways taking a shot in the dark as the impacts of the decisions arent known until after it has been made though truthfully after some playtime one can guess to a point the impacts they will have and if i would request a specific addition to be made to the game it would be to add the statistics to the decision screen so that more informed decisions can be made additionally i would like to see difficulty settings andor different gamemodes that cater to players different playstyles or fortés or merely adjustabletoggleable settings for campaigns that can add diversity to each playthrough something that i believe would be a welcome addition especially taking into account how repetitive and grinding the game can become as early as 12 hours into a campaign being as this focus more specifically on political aspects of governing a city i might also recommend a system be put in place that would allow a player to create their own party that way they could fight to pass their own policies and work to elect their own councilmembers rather than be limited to merely courting the leadership and membership of other parties which may or may not help fulfill the mayors agenda though the political aspects of this game are a refreshing change for a city builderruler they could use more fleshing out as it feels very disconnected and twodimensional in its current state

long story short urban empire is an interesting and rather ingenuitive approach to the ageold city builder genre however it is executed in a way that feels shallow and repetitive to experienced and newcomers to the genre alike i will likely play this game more nevertheless and look forward to future updates and dlc though i hope that the developers will heed the input of the community and release a significant amount of free content to improve upon a regrettably barebones game as previously stated i am someone who plays strategysimulation games all the time i love the idea and the game is far from bad as some other reviews have stated but it needs more draw and replay value to keep even the most battlehardened strategy gamers coming back for another playthrough and quite honestly i am on the cusp of recommending to that demographic in particular but widespread appeal to people not as weird as me is unfortunately lacking

final conclusion amazing concept needs more work

610

#####

i want to love this game i really do it has great potential and it is fun to play around with  there are currently only four families to play as and this seems very lacking  the game needs some work and the ai requires a lot of tweaking  in its current state it feels like a disappointment i had high hopes and 40 usd was not worth what you get to play

#####

this game is way to difficult not in the providingafunchallengeway kind of difficult in the whythehelllosingnow kind of way

#####

if they keep up the patching and dlc this will be a very good game its an fun timesink right now but it need a bit more lets hope they get more stuff out soon

#####

i have been wanting to give the game a chance for a while now and while there are issues that hinder its long term playability its not as bad as the reviews had made it seem at first glance if you find it on sale for 10 or lower it is a decent game

#####

this game is an illusion illusion wich makes you think that it has complex game mechanics but in truth this is very shallow game how to win build and invest all your citys money in districts and improvements and force your city to negative balance after that raise taxes in most cases when your bank balance is on red parties are forced to accept the tax raise then just upgrade districts after districts and build more improvements and research more tec to get your citys economy fucked up again to raise taxes repeat this for 200 years and you win the game

#####

this game is half built they have not provided updates with any regularity it should be considered early access it is so unpolished and unfinished and they seem to have no intentions of finishing the game

#####

what i like

1 interface  one of the easier ones to learn 2 tutorial  it could be more clear but for the most part its straightforward if youre paying attention 3 the general idea  as a longtime fan of the tropico franchise it was nice to see kalypso trying something similar yet new 4 politics  having to work the games political system to stay in power and pass legislation requires cunning and strategy making it easily the best part of the game next to building stuff

what i dont like 

1 game crashes  that speaks for itself except to say theyre mercifully infrequent 2 financial aspect  it seems the only way to increase revenue is to up the tax rate putting your city at a 70 or higher rate by the end of the game income seems unaffected by population and when switching a district to medium or high density the revenue almost never outweighs the costs regardless of the demand for new space which is almost a new problem itself with how the zoning demand meters never seem consistent or accurate 3 slow  due to the issue with how finances run progressing and upgrading the city go very slowly ive completed several campaigns with different families but i never once had the revenue to risk paying for high density if theres a way to do it consistently without following a strict strategy someone please tell me and ill try it out and edit this review accordingly otherwise theres something seriously wrong with the financial aspect of this game comparitively 4 the political consequences always seem a bit too easy and fixing it would not be a simple matter of making things harder there should be more options to really make it the complex challenge the game suggests it is more details within the available options also wouldnt hurt

bottom line if the developers fixed zoning demand political consequences and options revenuecost issues and the crashes it would be a much more playablereplayable game until then ive played about as much as im interested in playing it and at 15 hours of play i cant say its worth buying

#####

edit  after weeks and weeks of promised patches and upgrades this one gets demoted to probably my most disappointing pc purchase of the 21st century on a dollarfordollar basis  frankly im not sure where or how they can fix this mess other than bending over and letting folks who paid full price kick them square in the rear end   thats probably a much simpler solution than trying to make a game out of this   in the end you get to watch a city grow and pass some resolutions which have little to no bearing on the outcome  

this game is so terrible that it has ensured that i will never purchase from this developer or publisher again without waiting for reviews which clearly demonstrate the design wasnt pushed to market despite not being a game    and even then theyll need to offer  a big discount to help me get some of my money back that i wasted on this turkey  come to think of it i now wish i had used this money to buy turkey instead of this though both the bird and this game can put you to sleep

my original review continues below and its still valid

______________________________________________________________________



overall i have to give it a thumbsdown   a very wide idea with very little depth  essentially you build up goodwill and then spend it on things that are important for you to pass  but that idea ends up feeling halfbaked at best

the economics of the game are also way off  want to install street lamps  you greedy bastard   want to have an asphalt road you wasteful pig  whats that  you want phone service  what the hell is wrong with you we cannot afford that

if the developer redials the economics to make upgrades more balanced not easier just more balanced it would help this game out a lot

#####

i think those that wrote negative reviews need to rethink their opinion

you need to sink some serious planning to do well in this game  

when i first played this there were a number of annoying things mentioned in th emany negative reviews  many have been fixed and i dont doubt this game will get better but

i just got voted out after my second election but it took 8  hours to get to that point 

you  have to pay attention before putting an edict up for vote there are a number of things going into your success on the votenot just hammering the plead  demand  or threat buttons  these can help you but a lot mor to it than that

i admit when i first played i thought ok  not much too this then i read the reviews and was like bummer but i was wrongand so are many of the reviews

and if they put a little effort into itue has serious potential





#####

boring game looks great at first but its just an illusion i regret paying for this one

#####

the game has been abandoned by its devs the game itself is alright but the tutorial is the most useless fucking thing hardly tells you anything so if your new to the game i reccomend either not buying it or fucking watching as many walkthroughs as possible to even grasp a bit of the game

sure its unique but the idiotic devs decided to abandon it 
overall its a 410

#####

i really like the idea of urban empire but it doesnt lean into the political stuff enough if it wants to be a political game then there needs to be a better lobbying and barter systems where you build up allegiances and favours over time etc good idea but poorly implemented and explained so it ends up being slow and frustrating

#####

pros
 interesting and somewhat novel concept
 eventsside stories are pretty fun but get repetitive real soon

cons
 core idea is not well implemented as it is pretty shallow
 politics lacks depth and any meaning whatsoever also very linear and no real choices with no impact
 parties do not have an opinion left parties wanting to lower taxes for elites
 data views are pretty useless
 tech tree is pretty meaningless at the end of each era you can easily research all techs no meaningful choices doesnt mattter if you get a building a year early or late
 bugs missingwrong texts graphics behaving not correctly when changing infrastructure gets very laggy to the end memory leak

#####

i have been playing city sims since the first sim city i generally enjoy kalypso products but this title comes up short in several areas

1 balance it does not truly allow alternate paths to city politics want to build a facist or communist state good luck

2 mechanics too much click this click that

3 city customisation no dense commercial areas you can build a manhattan or the like just a mixed commercialresidential zone

4 graphics  vanilla the end game residential and commercial buildings looke exactly alike except for a little out of place sign atop the commerical buildings do they expect modders to do the work

5 replayability do it once its pretty much done

all this outweighs the great concepts in the game maybe ill come back and check on it in 3 months or maybe ill play skylines in any event cannot recommend

#####

im gonna be honest this really isnt as bad of a game as people are making it out to be
i do advice buying it from g2a as you can get it for cheaper

#####

sadly i cannot reccommend this game theres many reasons but ill keep it brief 

the way this game sells itself as a politicalcity builder hybrid is true to an extent except that each aspect is way too shallow 

first the city building or lack thereof you only really build service buildings  schools police stations clinics etc  and you are stuck building your city using a district mechanic which involves just clicking and dragging over an area the roads and zones are automatically done for you theres much more to say but if youre looking for a city builder  dont look here 

secondly and most disappointingly as i knew the citybuilder aspect was second fiddle to this part the political simulator is just not good at all the parties are hardwired to rise and fall depending on the eras so no matter what decisions you make  there will be the same parties 

the political decisions themselves wreak of a liberal socialist bias the game sort of forces you to adopt progressive policies because the benefits are simply all positive and theres no counterbalance to give you pause for not adopting it theres literally no reason to play with a conservative minded playstyle you will be far behind somebody who just adopts all the progressive policies as they become available 

i had high hopes for this game but i have to say its one of the most disappointing purchases ive ever made

#####

david cameron simulator

kidding aside if youre into political games aka democracy 3 and nation states that involve choosing policies and seeing how your decisions shape the place you rule and also you look forward to the political aspects of the game rather than the city building ones i think that you would appreciate it the unique thing that differenciates this game from the other titles i mentioned is that one it provides an actual visual representation of that location rather than just text descriptions and two it features a historical storyline with the political decisions reflecting the time period

do not buy this game if youre looking for a city builder because that will just disappoint you since that is not the games focus considering the high price as well if thats what you want just get cities skylines and look for some industrial revolution themesmods for your city however buy this game if youre looking for a good indepth political simulator

#####

it feels unfinished like the content that was to make it great was cut for dlc perhaps
i dont see this on the list of top sellers atm so maybe they wont feel its worth their while to realese said dlc now example being grand ages medieval 

reborn and kalypso have shot themselves in the foot did kalypso really think that this would work again

fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me  

i am done with games by this publisher and their studios now for the near future atleast

#####

the game is shallow when it comes to the political wheeling and dealing that is supposed to be its main premise and the simulation side leaves much to be desired after struggling to make an economically viable city several times  its quite hard to get anywhere near a balanced budget  i got bored with the simulation the interface also leaves much to be desired the game expects a lot of attention but the interface is too abstract to accommodate this kind of playing 

urban empire does have a novel premise but it fails move beyond it those looking for entertainment will get bored after a couple of hours and those looking for a challenge will be frustrated by its interface and unbalanced simulation

#####

bugs and performance issues make it unplayable and the devs ignore them completely cool concept abysmal delivery


#####

urban empire is a very interesting amalgamation of different game genres which doesnt quite find its place 

i think most people bought this game hoping for a deeper city builder and were disappointed they got a citybased democracy series inspired product make no mistake this game is a resource management simulator the resources just happen to be forms of happiness such as security and health cash and political capital derived from interactions with various competing political factions

the game is fine but either it was marketed to the wrong demographic or simply people who bought the game didnt quite understand the place the game fills this is not an earth shattering game but it is a shame that it was received so poorly i think with some care and rebalancing the game could have been much better than it has been left however it doesnt make business sense to invest time into something the customers have generally written off

id be very interested to see what could be made using this idea for a political simulation in future this is a unquestionably a niche genre the soundtrack is fantastic

#####

first off i am a huge fan of the tropico series so i may be a bit biased that said this is easily one of the most addictive games that ive played in a long time

you really have to give it a chance though the first halfdozen playthroughs it can feel like it is just unbelievably hard then i realized that i didnt need to wait for the game to tell me to add another district once your first district fills up make sure your cashflow is positive and build another district that will set you back in the shortterm but then youll get into a rhythm of building new districts adding services waiting until they fill up with industrycommercial buildings  and then rinse and repeat

the real meat comes in the way that you choose to develop the tech and add services or stockpile wealth will you try to up your salary early so that you can bypass votes and build freely will you let the council do what they will and save your points for a rainy day

i did and thats where i really started having fun with it it sort of feels like youre winning if your city has electricity before the 1800s are out i unlocked contraception and womens right to choose around 1860 in one game and it felt like i had created a cultural mecca out of nothing

of course i blew it in the next era by adding services more quickly than i was sourcing revenue or adding new districts and had to start over but now i enjoy every restart because i have new ideas for how to develop my city this time electric early and straight to assembly line oh but i added electric lights in my first district too early and now were broke and i spent all of my political capital getting here and two of the parties are pissed at me

time for a fresh start


tldl  released today yesterday havent slept brain hurts 1010 would disturb sleep patterns again

#####

i dont often preorder games but when i saw this games trailer for the first time i practically fell in love it with it i thought it would be a city management game where you wouldnt have godly powers or freedom of a monarch where your every lifechanging decision would be outright accepted no matter how insane they were 

i expected this game to be more than a bribe for a new district sort of fashion i thought it would offer an indepth lifechanging decisions i can understand it was an experimental topic and if experimented correctly i am sure this game could be a cultclassic but however developers seem to have decided in favor of casual gamers

you have to be stupid to not understand mechanics of this game and surely you have the iq level of a gold fish if you wont get bored of this game after couple of hours of gameplay

however i hope someday someone will do this game right and that day it might end up having a coregamers that will worship the masterpiece that is created

#####

abandoned game dont buy

#####

this game is fantastic but has many flaws still i have 10 and a half hours on it it gets very hard halfway thru and fail out it needs to fix things as in why companys go bankrupt and how to fix them that is the biggest flaw how can you have a company and not know why it fails pleaseeeee fix that

#####

so far i have 21 hours in urban empire i really want to like it but it needs some fixing some of the points im bringing up have probably been brought up and i have noticed that the developer is paying attention to the reviews so they may already be working on fixing the issues anyway i need to share the things i have reacted to

1 the fps
when my city was growing bigger and bigger i noticed a drastic drop in fps my pc can handle many demanding games without any major issues but for some reason it doesnt work here i tried lowering the graphics setting as low as possible to try to fix it but the problems remained in my case my city was around 70000 inhabitants and sometimes the fps went below 10 fps im wondering if its at all possible to get higher than 60 fps ingame because it feels like an fps lock i wouldnt have a problem with that if it ran at 60 fps the entire game but it doesnt

2 lack of clear information
from the get go i was really confused with all the information that was given to me i still have trouble finding information about different things however that may be my fault one thing is really bugging me whenever you resolve an event and get bonuses to some of the different aspects social life happiness security etc sometimes you get an indication to what is affected in what way when you hover over with your mouse indicator other times it doesnt also there are times when text is missing in dialogue windows it feels very inconsistent and should be considered for a patch

3 repetitive events
whether its about the sucurity in a district the circus coming to town or getting criticism from a local journalist many events show up one too many times during your ruling so many times in fact that you could learn what option to choose to get the best result every time if they would be reused after the end of time victory i wouldnt mind but as of now its a little too repetetive

4 consequences
my first game i learned about the concequenses of having low goodwill towards many of the parties but as soon as i just focused on districts and kept an eye on the taxes i could cruise through the game without having to worry about anything political well apart from the majoral election i was so nervous the first couple of times but as time went on i barely had to appeal to any parties to make it through to the next period maybe a higher difficulty setting option could be in its place

then there are features i would like to be included such as
 being able to control where the rci zones are placed in a district
 going backwards in modifying a district without having to cancel the entire modification to fix something you want to change its really bugging me
 being able to zoom out even more than is possible at the moment i want to see my entire city in all its glory granted if i can run it with the highest graphics setting

to be clear i really want to like it im really close to liking it i have played some city simulators before and even though they are fun i really want this concept city ruling to be great after patching i think this game has great potential i really like that the developer are keeping an eye on the feedback and wish them the best of luck in making this game the best it can possibly be

as of now i cant fully recommend urban empire i want to but i cant i sort of like it i want to really like it its not a terrible game but its not a great game yet

edit ignore what i said about going backwards in modifying a district turns out that i was blind and missed that feature

#####

bought this game on the summer sale despite the reviews not worth it its a buggy mess that is boring even when its working corectly and with 0 support from the developer this game isnt worth anything

#####

it is a poorly optimized mess with a terrible ui and poor tool tips high hopes for this game but the mechanics can be easily exploited and the replayability is little to none avoid

#####

an incredible concept that fell flat on its face in execution politics is boring and several parties feel like theyre only in there to arbitrarily provide difficulty to the player the economy system is very interesting but sadly the game doesnt provide many ways to experiment since making profit is ridiculously hard unless you follow a meta

#####

i dont get the negativity
its a political simulator i quite like it
no not worth the initial cost i did get it in a sale but i like it its a good game
maybe they changed it recently or something and ive not played too long but still its good not 100 sure why people are so err angry about it


#####

i really wanted to like this game but it is boring

1 long stretches with nothing going on even at max speed

2 a poor economic system which once you decide to just max your taxes out means you fly to victory

3 the technology system while interesting is also rather odd

#####

finally a city management game without having to worry about the building this is not a city builder so if that is what you are looking for then do not buy this game however if you want a game that is more on managing a city and dealing with politics on top of that then this is the game for you

plenty of replayability due to different starting choices you make along with quite a few scenarios to test your skill

#####

the game has two aspect  the city council politics play and city builder  the city council part is shallow and incomplete  the city builder part however does offer a lot of depth and novel ideas  the negative reviews calling otherwise probably does not understand the game  it is hardly their fault though  this game is so poorly designed on representing mechanism information to player  the shallow tutorial barely explains the ui and interface  and even if you bother to read the game manual it still fail to uncover mist on some of the most important mechanisms like how social mobility works  the catastrophic failure of presenting mechanism information to player effectively made it more of a puzzle game rather than a sim game

rants aside the game does have some novel design such as peoples needs can be served by private sector or public sector  and you can choose to collect a lot of tax and serve people directly or use policy to guide the private sector to do that  the two path apparently repesents two different modern political ideaology and was supposed to interfere with the city council politics system  however the mechanism behind this is more complicated than it sounds and again is barely explained reaping all the potential fun off it

in conclusion it is very hard to have fun with this game even if you are a veteran of city builder game and is willing to read the manual word by word  but do take a look at the game manual to see if you think it is worth a try  there is a lot in this game it is just so hard to dig them out

#####

i have played quite a bit and i can say that this game is in no way worth the price the concept is interesting but there is a complete lack of documentation as to why anything hapens the way it does why decisions are made by the council and how you can fix it
 there have been a few guides that tell you to tax everyone to the max and roll in money and then the third age rolls around elections come and its game over
  in my most recent attempt i was making a small profit had decent stats among the council and the population reasonable tax levels good city services and suddenly i lost the election 
 unless this game is patched heavily mechanics fixed and far more documentation provided please do not waste your money

#####

this game does not make sense from many aspect it wants to be different from the others like simcity or cities skylines and so on but the realization of the new ideas are just simply bad city council will refuse all of your expansion ideas if your balance is in the red but will approve nearly anything if it is in the green you can raise taxes in the beginning with quickly going into the red spending area and then build nearly unlimited number of districts afterwards if you try to follow the tutorial then you will have bad luck stagnation andor bankruptcy comes very easily it is not that the game is difficult if you know the mechanics maximum taxation in the beginning then build districts quickly then you can have quite a big settlement easily otherwise it is just a misery

#####

i actually enjoyed this gameits a bit different than other city builders i play i have to think through decisionsbuild another district or repave the existing ones then theres the costs nothings free its closer to real life than people think in the real world i do this kind of planning its probably why i still play city players

i havent yet experienced any of the bugs although some of the spellings are odd a copy editor should have run through the game before release

other than that im having fun playing

#####

this is the first game i have ever returned on steam  i wanted to like it i played several games as different families tried several strategies to no avail  after more than 10 hours played the glaring deficiencies could no longer be overlooked  the economy makes little to no sense it felt like whoever designed the economy had only a passing familiarity with how economics work  very frustrating  
as for the politics there is no real feeling of agency as a player  there is a general trend towards liberalizationie womens gay rights which the player either goes along with or if you try to buck the trend you get stuck voting over the same edicts time after time  
ultimately i felt like my time played boiled down to just watching bars progress  waiting for a vote which was a foregone conclusion come up for a vote  it felt pointless so much so that in my final game i didnt even feel like trying to get reelected  the last thing this game had to offer was a defeated screen

#####

the game has an interesting angle the idea of adding a politics perspective to a city building game is one i like the problem for me is that there is not enough excitementengaging stuff happening it gets boring really fast

#####

i got this game refunded  i am a fan of the tropico serie civ and the like  this game as a massive performance drop after 2nd era check youtube lots of reviewers with high end pcs reporting the problem not patched in two weeks  also i find this game boring and repetitive  it looks like a great game but it is not in my opinion  not worth 45

#####

i really love this game i was afraid that it would just decay in its postrelease state but with the new update i see a beacon of hope that this game will be one unique gem

they say its not to be confused with a city builder to be honest you are building a city the mechanics are just different then usual it is rather forgiving though in the early postrelease state of the game you could threaten all the parties to stay mayor during every single election

yet the price is still too high id say 20 would be a fair price 

82  10 with a tendency to a 94

beware refunders as usual will downvote all reviews giving a thumbs up  so dont let yourself be influenced by those cheap tricks

#####

i had such high hopes for this game i love strategy type builder games and when i seen this i just couldnt wait to get my hands on it sadly tho the develepers seem to have just abandonded it after launch the game was full of bugs and typos they released like 1 small patch a week or 2 after release and fixed a few of the bugs then nothing its been a few months and their has been no word from the devs about and future updates patches or anything its sad because this game in my opinion had so much potential

#####

doa no support no updates

#####

its good yes but not 40 good get it when its on sale

#####

not really a city builder not really a deep political game either  if it was not for the optimization i would never have written a review  while some of the crashing issues were resolve the game has an issue after the third issue as frame rates drop and the game becomes unresponsive at times  long loading into the game more so than games with anti cheat long save game loading 

since this game is prone to techinical issue i would avoid it if those issues do somehow get fixed then remember this is not a very deep game and only a casual city planner  political game where the numbers really dont matter as it too easy to stay in office and strong arm the council

#####

i had high hopes for the game those hopes where smashed hard it kinda feels like a really weak hybrid of crusader kings and a citybuilding sim till the event keeps repeating and you realize that all unique ones are simply scripted and appear everytime you start a new game the politics system seems interesting but feels like an alpha build

#####

well the idea and the concept are great but that is about all this game has going for it
project was abandoned shortly after launch with no new updates or fixes
stay away from this game for your own sake

#####

this game is unfortunately quite unbalanced you have no chance to improve your buildings because you always have not enough money the idea of the game is great but state of now is you can click through the time but youll never have enough money to improve your city so it is just a matter of time until you lose

#####

great concept very poor and repetitive gameplay no fixe and no update
clearly not recommended

#####

disapointment and waste of my money tried to refund but had to many hours

5 hours in and i have already felt how reptitive it really is

to much time spent watching the vote system

if you like a sit back and watch game this is perfect for you as you do not need much attention to play the game

#####

so much potential so much disappointment

this is not a city builder in any sense of the phrase  it is not a city ruler either  its a stare at a map with very minimal interaction until you have to go and vote in the city council

i wanted this game to be fun  its a unique concept to add the politics into a city game  it simply isnt  its boring and tedious

and as id played it beyond two hours  to try to give it a chance i cant even get my money back due to steams ridiculous refund policy

save your time and money  avoid this game

#####

just dont buy
the game is a mess
the early alpha kind of mess

#####

this game is fantastic  i will admit it has a large learning curve  the creator of this game made an excellent new genre of city building real time strategy and turn based gaming  i have been playing city builders since the original sim city  this game has all of the fun of those games with an added element of politics  you must learn to work with and destroy the political parties to get the things you want passed  this makes it a very realistic game and fun once you get the hang of it


#####

hate the way of the game mechanics everything must go pass council no possible way go for dictatorship 

and this game is overheating my computer even with good graphic card  water cooling

#####

would not purchase at this time  minus all the bugs that i will assume will eventually get crushed which make the game currently unplayable vanishing money etc the entire premise is bs and the developers really made zero attempt to hide their political biases  the game promised a political mayoral city builder but honestly there is only one acceptable path forward if you want to succeed at the game progressivism  you try and run any economic or political method and the game becomes either impossible or near so to play even if real life says otherwards  not asking the same difficulty all the way through but the game is so biased as to make it unfun ditto terminology for example ie relax minor sodomy laws isnt 1 glbt rights as glbt rights a werent a city issue and b the term didnt even exist until the 1990s basically  nobody gave a flying # about glbt rights in era 1 or 2 at best you should say gay rights or even homosexual rights  also decisions should matter ie there should be positive aspects to rejecting gay or women rights because there are in real life and their should be negatrive aspects to approving them ditto though we can hem and haw over the percentages point is games like this should offer tradeoffs as no measure is 100 positive most arent even majoirty positive

figure out what you want to make this game and then make it that way because right now its just a progressive wet dream if they were god to show everybody else the errors of their way

#####

i thought a city ruler style game was what i wanted over a city builder but i guess i was wrong as this game was not what i wanted trust me most people playing this now will get 10 hours max out of this game then quit

by city ruler you can raise taxes to the max or not at all and win either way events are all the same a predictable the economic system is broken as i can lower bussiness taxes to 0 and no one shows up but once we give the whole damn city a 50 tax rate with no benefitseditics everyone is all for investment there is also little to no content which is why the game itself lacks replayability as every map and familiy plays almost exactly the same literaly nothing changes in addition there is the horrible tech tree it looks cool but the system sucks and there is little to nothing about world events besides the newspaper articles

now i know what your thinking these guys made the tropico series yeah but no
same publisher diffrent devs which is why this isnot a city builder

this game is a city builder game with the builder taken out its literaly just a city that no matter what you do and who you offend on the council you get everything your way no matter what i can threaten a party every single month before a vote telling them i will execute them all and they will happily grant whatever i want note this is the 4th era too

all together there was nothing that made me enjoy the game besides the inital start up on when everything was new after a hour you realize the game is overpriced and nothing special

#####

a good try but falls well short of the mark especially at the price for sale instore  its kind of a mix of democracy and sim societies with the problems indemic in those two games multiplied together  the demand ratio system is buggy infrastructure options double up rather than upgrading  costings are near impossible to afford in the time periods and if you want to keep playing past era v eventually the environment rating drops into the negatives no matter what  i paid 60 aud for this as i bought it from a store definitely about 40 too much especially since when i installed it off the disc i had to essentially uninstall it and download it from steam to get it to work  if id bought it on steam id have asked for a refund  i shouldve put the money towards something else  next game from this publisher i think of buying ill definitely test try first

#####

i was a great mayor surplus of money citizens were happy and healthy then one day it all changed one political party fractured into many parties as technology advanced and our people grew entitled and selfish resulting in the communist party

the communist party latched onto my success as a mayor and then pushed all other parties that supported me away then had the audacity to vote me out of office destroying all of my political support i lost the game because i let the communists fester i cant remember the last time i have actually seen a game over screen probably dark souls

trump is just now in office and hes making video games great again

communism not even once

1010 would grow a successful empire for the communists to subvert agian

#####

so i know that this isnt a city builder but a city ruler blablabla however the gameplay is incredibly shallow in most aspects the concept is amazing and i think the devs wasted some potential with this game the main issues i have with the game are as i said shallow city sim related gameplay you might be used to get from other games  which in itself wouldnt be a major deal if other aspects of the game would be more interesting however there is no real roleplaying aspect other than the occasional trait points you get or lose flavour text for characters and houses

then there is the political side of the game which is pretty disappointing you basically have a bunch of political parties that shift in power wanna pass a law and parties that support it are in the minority no problem just tell the leader of an opposing party that youll ruin his career or straight out threaten to murder him and there you go vote passed zone out a disctrict or build a police station threaten people increase taxes funding for something strenghten lgbt rights from horrible to kinda horrible or get fucking elected do the exact same fucking thing why is there no campaigning for elections no political intrigues managing your own party or whatever else politics could have been implemented in this game

a price tag of 20 bucks would be acceptable for this game id say factoring in the current price of 45 for me id give it a 410 disregarding price a 610

#####

i really really like the idea of this game and i was very excited to play it its supposed to be a strategymanagement game where you need to take politics into account 

after roughly 10 hours and two restarts i finally made it through the campaign the early game was fun but it was becoming repetitive in mid and late game the challenge is completely gone as soon as you figure out that it always pays of if you increase the taxes as long as you keep services up so the cycle was increase taxes add services increase taxes add services until you had huge amounts of money the parties almost never mattered so i stopped paying attention to them then in the end of the fourth era i already had everything researched and was focusing on achieving the other goals in game some of the goals are hard to achieve but not because they are difficult but instead because the mechanics of the game feel random i did not try the scenarios yet but i will likely not do that unless they release a serious balancing patch 

i did not experience any breaking bugs however the performance of the game got worse drastically in the late game if you play on speed four on default settings my rig is beyond the recommended specs with an i7 and a geforce 980ti

#####

i dont see what the big problem is  game seems fine to me

#####

quickly became boring 
fake choices all around
unclear data especially regarding the economy whats working whats not etc

good ideas bad execution do not buy it

#####

its like they took sim city stripped it down to its core and tried to build a janky political game around it i like the idea they were going for but the game play is awful feels like it was halfassed and never finished 25

#####

this game was very memory intensive once it loaded up the tutorial was well designed the idea was alot more promising then the game play i was hoping to experiment with different play styles unfortunately this game skews to requiring high taxes and doesnt seem to model the effects of policies that well experimented with trying a small state approach  but basically the parties in power rarely think that way so essentially becomes tedious to try different approaches got boring then very quick for the price definitely not worth it

#####

havent felt tempted to give this another chance after initial forced play through concept was awesome but implementation is lacking i regret forcing myself to play for 13 hours when all the game had to offer can be unlocked in 30min

do not buy

#####

it pains me a bit to give this a bad review  its not as bad as ga medieval 

the problem is that the game play is completely linear and everything else is really just the illusion of choice

the only way to get new things passed through the legislature is to have tax money coming in and the only way to get more tax money coming in is to be running a deficeit so the game is just a constant cycle of purposely building enough to run you into the red so that you can justify raising taxes theres not a lot that you actually get to choose

the other big issue is that not enough things are explained and im not even talking about not knowing what the consequences of decisions are before hand im talking about the fact that a lot of the tooltips dont make sense in english and arent intuitive at all theres no clear explanation of how things interact with each other

the devs only created one play style there dont seem to be any consequences to raising taxes so tax and spend all day and heaven for bid you have a different idea youll just get stuck behind with shit piling on top of you endlessly

#####

i rarely like to post negative reviews for a title instead liking to offer encouragement and critical appraisal for developers however this title was a serious disappointment to me and coming from a big publisher behind the likes of tropico it really needed to be better

in short urban empire is a political simulator but the sad fact is it never really lives up to that in any meaningful way all the parties i encountered despite being placed in what seemed to be a realistic way upon the political spectrum ended up having little to differentiate each other with enough bargaining  the game lets you plead demand or threaten to change party members stances on a vote every party could be persuaded to accept a vote in two hours of play i lost one vote and that was because by that time i couldnt really care less about pushing any harder

this game has potential but currently it feels highly random i played for two hours and in that time i rarely felt like there were any major differences between the political parties other than the fact that the games scripting told them how they should vote on an issue the social democrats always seemed to disagree and need to be persuaded where as the physiocratics always agreed whole heartedly by the end of my two hours i was sadly bored stiff

you might say two hours is a short time but i saw the second era and i put through quite a number of votes and city infrastructure changes but by the end of those two hours i felt distinctly like i was to quote someone else pulling levers and watching how it changed things between votes i would just sit and watch the city and in the long run it all came down to budget and a procedure of picking edicts to increase income and forcing votes to up the taxes

i just couldnt be bothered to force any more votes or try an more edicts because i simpky felt like this balancing act was all id be doing for 4 eras then much to my annoyance i tried to save my city only to find the game wouldnt let me it appears that unless you have finished all tutorial missions then you cant save im sure thats a bug that will be fixed but it didnt improve my first impressions of urban empire at the time

urban empire is a nice idea but i feel it lacks too much depth to make it a game id recommend to people i watched much of the game on youtube before release and i prepurchased based on my thoughts it had looked fun from watching but playing was not the same experience

if urban empire only had half the humour and detail of tropico it may have allowed me to get past the monotony of the political system yes i do feel it was monotonous and indeed the only attempt at humour was a reference to tropico which i wont spoil it was a nice touch but didnt improve on things

for the first time i feel inclined to refund a title and for that reason i cant recommend urban empire there is a game here should the developers act to add in a layer atop the political bargaining an ability to design the layout of your city would be a start and frankly that is another thing that stopped me finding any real enjoyment in the game if i could have done a mayors job and planned the layout of my city then i might have had something to do whilst waiting for votes to pass and balances to improve but for some reason the city builds itself or you at least have no say in road layout and rci placement you can determine how much industry commercial and residential is built but not where its almost as if youre playing the role of a mayor with lots of helpers turned on to leave you less to do youre just public relations for the mayor really

#####

concept behind the game is interesting however like many others i find the implementation sorely lacking lacks the replayability required to make this a worthwhile purchase

#####

so i got this game because i liked the concept and thought it would be cool  while thats true the implementation is god awful i dont enjoy talking poorly about games to the contrary i always comment only when i have something positive to say but after the second age there is literally no way to balance anything or keep your little empire running if the devs had actually played the game through once or twice then this may have been averted but i honestly cant see them having done this the game works awesomely through the first age or so but falls apart so quickly

#####

concept  great
mechanics  great
gameplay  good
graphics  good
ui  meh
sound  someone dropped the ball

notifications for events have no sound and times out  and they are small icons in the left bottom section of the screen that you can easily miss whoever thought that was a good design choice needs to find a new job

#####

damn so close

yes i know its not a city builder like soooo many have said  i know what the game is but boy this disapoints you start as one ofa number of families all with slightly different traits which do pretty much nowt  and you start at 1800  build your first district  ok so far so good thats fine shows you the council chambers and voting process  ok yep got it errrrr ummmmmthats kind of it

yes you can issue a few edicts  the research trees are reasonably interesting but again gets boring fast

build couple more districts  change density to medium  all pass without any need to threaten parties and boom thats it i have 39 million in the bank nd all the parties love me so i never need to do anything with the voting  way overpirced for what you get i smell massivley 10 pound dlc with  just one more family on its way

grammar and spelling in the game is truly dreadful  hundreds of typos quality control anyone

music is tedious and boring after 2 minutes  now switched off for good

only 3 maps to pick from yes i agree all slightly different in terms of difficulty of building a city but as you only need 3 districts set to medium density that plays totally no part in anything

i really was waiting for this game  i wanted to enjoy it and for the first our i did  now i find myslef after 7 and half hours playtime just sitting there waiting for my research to finish and the next mayor election twiddling my thumbs 

sorry but this is dreadful  another overpriced and overhyped full price release i respect the work that goes into games i really do same issue with planetcoaster rollercoaster tycoon 3 i played for well over 1000 hours  planet coaster 80 and bored as hell and i respect that they developers need to make a profit  but jeez i should of known this would not be goodthe current early reviews are all pretty much negative todo yourself a favour wait for a sale in a years time with all the millions of overpirced dlc on its way thrown in or just avoid altogether igave it the benefit of the doubt but when you find yourself falling asleep to a game the signs are not good


editnow 10 hours into it and as the shuskys family it does change a little bit in era 4 i wont spoil it incase people want to play it  but not enough to dramaticly change gameplayreviews still coming in on online sites and are pretty poor mixed is fair needs a bit of a re think and some freeee updates due to the massive price for a half standard game

#####

ok so heres my two cents this game is flawed needs some tlc and is vastly overpriced at regular price but it is a challenging game that has several unique twists to the city buildingpolitical simulation genre that makes it worth a buy if you can get it on sale especially if you grab it from humble and give a few cents at charity

the gameplay is far different from tropico and cities skylines so dont go into this expecting either of those games nor go into it expecting a lot of handholding which is rare these days once you get a basic grip on how to get the game to tick along it becomes enjoyable if a bit difficult at times if i had to compare the game to other games id say that it runs closer to the guild series of games then other city sims because your guiding a family and a city through the ages

overall is this game perfect no no its not is it decent playable and enjoyable yes it is just not at full price i would highly reccomend giving this a try if you can get a good deal on it especially because it has potential to be improved in the future with further patches if kalypso and reborn do release more updates but even if they dont its a pretty decent game as is a strong 7 out of 10

seriously though give this game a chance whenever its on sale also protip try to limit the number of saves you have because ive noticed that the game gets more buggy if theres a lot of saves

#####

most enjoyable game i was a bit worried about all the negative reviews and comments but i really like playing this game you have to like the genre of course but it sucks you in if you open up to it as it creates a nice atmosphere some miner bugs and the camera control feels awkward but nothing disturbing for some strange reason the game does use al lot of memory and it takes a very long time to load a game the full price is however way to high and i would strongly recommend waiting for a serious discount before buying it

#####

this game was poorly finished graphics arent great either not a great city builder game unplayable

#####

i wanted to like this game but it did not catch my interest after 30 minutes of play the process of getting anything approved is tedious and the infrastructure installation in the districts is arcane at best the tutorial and the ui are terrible i requested a refund after an hour played

#####

right now i voting that this game gets a no vote from me  i dont really have that many issues with the game but i would like it if there was a correct way of governing that wasnt completely leftist  for example if i raise taxes to 100 people shouldnt have money anymore  i know that is an extreme example but there really isnt a reason to lower taxes in this game like there would be in real life  or if there is it should say it  also for liberal ideas which grant more rights it should be possible to lose the vote rather than getting an overwhelming majority of people in the council that always forces the issue  stuff like this gives an illusion of choice  you could try it differently but the game forces you into a direction  i wonder if the personal views of the devolper caused for this to happen because it seems to be a trend in other games like this as wellanything involving politics seem like they are try to teach you the correct way to think  

also there still are bugs  for example when you vote for a new mayor it doesnt tell you how the people are actually going to vote after you use your goodwill  the screen just stays the same and doesnt change  also as i am writing this the blackmail feature doesnt work anymore  tooltips  i would be nice if the game had them for more things other than having you click on an option and hoping you make the choice you wanted to

lastly i dont like the save system  right now it isnt a problem but what if in the future i would like to say start another game  the saves dont really seem to be ordered that well  of course i havent tried deleting saves yet so i dont know how different it would be

anyway just some thoughts on the product  im pretty sure it could be fixed with patches but right now stuff like this takes a lot of the fun out of it

#####

i guess this game is not for everyone judging by the reviews i however lowved it

could they have done more with it well yes i suppose the actual cit building piece could have been a lot better but i would not go into this game thinking it is a city builder its not its a political simulator id like to see if they can produce another one that adds a bit more functionality and nuance but this is fun so ill just leave it at that

#####

the game just really isnt that fun how to do well is far too opaque for example one victory requires a certain number of businesses to be a certain level and yet it is almost impossible to find out the level of a business and it is completely impossible to find out how the level is determined what affects it and how you could do anything about it there is just no information at all it is like stabbing in the dark and trying to kill a spider

the financial aspect is also challenging it is simply not clear where money is actually coming from how happiness supposedly affects productivity what productivity even is any of it it is all guesswork there is simply no information provided

the came is oddly contradictory the gameplay seems overly simple because you have no idea what youre doing and you just keep pressing the same kind of buttons but in reality it is very complex just there is no way to access or to understand that complexity perhaps if you read the source code but definitely not by playing the game i dont know if they intentionally hid complex mechanics to make the game seem more accessible or if it was all just a big mistake but it didnt work in my opinion

#####

it feels like a streamlined city builder which i like not a fan of drawing out roadways the political aspect adds an interesting perspective on the genre  the game has many pitfalls that are hard to get out of but not usually impossible   the political system could be a little more in depth it seems like it follows a perticular path with little deviation  its at the least an interesting experience but i do like this game

#####

this game is very unique
i have never seen another game where you try to tell people that even though we would be going in to debt shorterm it would be best in their best interest but they do not listen if you have ever studied much up on politics watched political discussions or debates then this is very realistic i rage quited when the people would not listen to me which in my opinion is very realistic for being a political sim 

for those people that give it a negative review because you spend most of your time begging that is not true if you know how to rule your city properly you should not need to negotiate with them all the time but even still most of what politics are is negotiating and on that front this game does an outstanding job and shows you what politics is really like

#####

after some discussions in the community forums ive copied my reviewcomment  i might change this once a few bugs are fixed

just as a midgame review and some context i got the game for free as a gift i casually mentioned seeing this game from a sponsored youtube prerelease lets play copy to a friend and they bought it for me i feel bad because i wouldnt have paid for this myself 

currently would not recommend and here are my reasons
 encountered at least one graphical bug i have a gtx1080 on a new rig running everything ultra at 4k 60fps fine but then there are these weird glitches
httpsteamcommunitycomprofiles76561198042237959screenshot97226806231905121

 silly game breaking save bug most people play games with a tutorial on the first time you play this game i guarantee you most players will not have 2m to buy the train station when it pops up in the tutorial at which point because theres an active tutorial quest you cant save sure you can go into negative and beg the emperor for money but most people playing for the first time dont want to throw their city into debt perhaps it was bad luck on my part but i had the graphical glitch happen at that time too didnt know what to do so wanted to save quit and reload but couldnt save so just gave up and restarted with tutorial off after reading through workaround on the forums

 as other people have mentioned the game does not explain a lot of the concepts in the game you have to either cross your fingers or trialanderror your decisions this isnt that the game is hard it just isnt streamlined and doesnt provided you enough information to be a political simulator or a city builder why does that party hate you i have no idea i can only guess and try to enact some of the policies they want increasing the density of my district will increase upkeep by 100k what are the benefits 

 beyond not having enough information some of the wording is very strange perhaps its because the dev teams firstlanguage isnt english for example 5 sales demand is a good thing this is a bit counter intuitive as decrease in sales demand is usually bad for an economy especially when inflation is not a concept in the game also an example of one policy says mild punishment for sodomy in fact this policy is to have milder punishment for sodomy rather than saying lets punish sodomy mildly as the policy name implies

 when there should be information but it doesnt show when a proposal pops up sometimes shoudl be all the time you can hover over the options and it will show you what the effects will be as an example one policy will pop up and itll have 3 options you might be able to hover over none 1 2 and very rarely 3 of the options this seems unintentional and some of the effects and proposals dont line up with the flavour text 

 immersion the cost scaling is a bit ridiculous it costs a lot of money to install street lamps and pave roads upkeep is also ridiculously expensive to the point that im now in era 3 1930s and i have districts which still have dirt paths and no lights i can afford a train station but i cant afford to pave the roads

but if you can get past all these the base idea behind the game is pretty fun balancing the political ideologies leftright liberalconservative as well as a little bit of roleplaying a family of mayors allegiance to the empire or independence and balancing personal finances is quite unique the broken parts of the game other than the graphic bugs can be avoided once youve played the game a few times through and know what to avoid or in the case of not knowing what a decision will do you can pretend its real life and not know the outcomes of your decisions beforehand hopefully the game does get patched but i whole heartedly agree we shouldnt expect to wait for a patch before a game is recommended

h1a novel game with an interesting premise and little handholding which appeals to meh1

govern a city for 200 years across 5 generations and attempt to achieve one of 5 victory conditions ie ala civilization seems like a fairly vanilla premise until you account for the fact that you do not have absolute power to implement anything

muchmost of what you seek to do will require city council support via a vote mechanic  before implementation within the council you will deal with a variety of party blocks representaing a slew of political idealogies that vary by era party support for your proposals depends upon their ideologycore values the current economic situation their relationship with you and player initiated political interaction plead demand threaten

h1the game sports a variety of other features to keep the gameplay interesting including  h1
 tech tree progress cloud 
 emergent events multiple choices choices can vary results influenced by the conditionscharactersitics of your citymayor 
 citydistrict planning location zoning infrastructure etc 
 municipal service implementation police church clinic school etc
 large scale works ie railway port university etc 
 economic planning taxes service funding economic edicts employment 
 governance state laws and edicts 
 citizen welfare social life health education fun etc 
 mayoral elections start in 3rd era a loss results in end
 progress narrative told through events newspaper clippings tech etc
list

plenty to do in the game but little prompting to do it if you are averse to being proactive in a gameplay sense or deducing the why behind a given in game result then ue will quickly become frustrating for you the game treads a fine line between deliberately obfuscating mechanics for the sake of immersiondepth and not providing enough feedback on mechanics that really should be made available  imo it does not always get this mix right some of this is by design but some is merely a lack of polish and will hopefully be corrected in time

h1in short a different take on an established genre ie city buidlinggovernance engaging for those that appreciate depth let down by late game performance issues at times a lack of feedback and noticeable incidences of primarily polish type bugs missing tooltips etc h1

h1for me it is refreshingly novel both engaging and fun if at times a little frustratingperplexing i recommend ith1

i just hit the 2 hour mark on this game and i had to review it

this game is a great mashup of city builder and political strategy sort of a mix between cities skylines democracy crusader kings and civilization

the game is easy enough to work with the basics are well explained though ive started over 2 times already because boy does it present a challenge

growth is limited by both your bank and your political prowess if youre too against the grain right off the bat anything you try and get done is going to be voted out while if you appease the parties you get some clout that you can use to push your own agenda

one issue that i have run into is the camera it is much easier to use the keyboard controls for it than to use the mouse ro else youll end up spinning the camera around wildly and never really get it into the right spot

placing of buildable areas called districts is by far one thing that is really nice with other city builders every road and zone was placed by hand now you control how much of what zone type typical rci you want and they are auto placed with roads already there

want to build a park or a church you can using services though the coucil will need to vote on any changes that are made unless youre paying for it out of your own pocket and yes here you have personal funds as well as city funds and you get paid every month

if you like city builders strategy games or political strategy games this is a game you will probably get a lot of enjoyment out of

#####

one of the worst games ive ever played really repetitive not at all stimulating and above all still the same mechanics after 10 years in the game additionally you build addons to your city after it has been approved however personalities change and party positions dont always stay so rigid and it is focused on policy half the time

i demand a freakin refund from the creators

#####

extremely promising game i really really wanted to like it you take charge of a city and have to manage building it in your vision and the viewsvotes of the political parties

the ui is terrible red means lower green means higher regardless of good or bad or unclear 5 demand for a product means the business needs 5 less to stay profitable 
has a lot of potential but really needs to be patched up

#####

do not buy this game ruling a city not so much more like you get to propose an idea and then if your lucky it will be passed nothing fun about this game also dont know if it is my computer or what but it runs very slowly and takes a long time to load not worth 40 heck not even worth 20 should be in a bargin bin for 5 or less

#####

where are the devs fix this game is the only way 
for now dont spend a dimme on this

#####

great concept and with some more work this could probably be something interesting but theres not alot of actual gameplay its more about you trying to pass things through the council all the time so not what i expected i guess i enjoy watching youtube lets plays of this alot more  i think the price is too high as well

#####

hyym this game is good as it provide all what it promise main problem is that there is no real incentive to oppose liberalsocialist policies nearly all policies are only positive so there is no reason to try fight against policies you can only be progressive or your city is not going to impove

#####

game does not work and devs stopped supporting it

#####

i like others was looking forward to the new concepts and refreshing ideas that the devolopers were talking about pre release  they were on the the right track but seem to have given up after release silly me was expecting a patch or as expected these days a dlc to make the game more interesting and enjoyable but they never came pretty disappointing really it could have been a great game but a waste of time and money for me

#####

so far i really like this game ive now gone into era 3 with 3 of the 4 families played on each of the maps and id definitely say that there is a good base for replayability ive seen it mentioned here that there are some choices that youre just going to want to make regardless of what youre doing owning to general buffs and thats true its the most limiting factor to the games replayability but i 1 dont think its as prevelant as some are saying and 2 imagine that will be addressed in coming patches

that leads me to yes this is going to be one of those games that really is going to need more work in coming patches before it has enough staying power to warrant sitting down and playing it for ages depending on what studios youre used to paradox anyone you may already be used to that sort of thing and are willing to be patient

i do agree though 40 seems a bit steep at the moment still i usually cant wait very long to try out new games in the genre and i ultimately thought it was worth it

#####

i love this game but it just feels like not enough time was put into this game the citybuilding feels very simple and linear you build your city by dragging a grid to make a district so your cities dont feel very unique or organic it feels like the same game every time you play and thats such a shame because its a great concept i still play the game occasionally but i wish they had put more time into it maybe a sequel could add the much needed depth to the game

#####

this was the game that broke the metaphorical camels back with kalypso games for me i cut out ea games and with kalypso media being the only other company i just refuse to get burnt by again with marginal if any initial upgrades and alleged cut content packaged into paid dlcs 

my game library is still overflowing faster than i can keep up without the trash from those publishers so dont feel like you have to buy this garbage

#####

i really wanted to like this game and have played 5 games but it has no depth and is way to hard
you start out you make a good of money and think your doing great so you start adding police stations schools and theatres etc and also electricity gas and sewers but they dont enhance your citizens lives visibly or increase money made in any way 

i have made it to age 3 on 4 occasions but everytime i start heamorrhaging money as citizens demand more services if you provide you lose massive amunts of money if you dont you get voted out 

another irk is that buildings dont changegrow over time they just look the same as 1890 and 1930
the game is simly too hard lags riduculously once you reach age 3 and feels pointless
all services are far too expensive you install electicity as it says it helps business the same goes for water pipes and phone lines but then businesses continue going bankrupt and you continue to lose money

kalypso need to put some serious work into fixing this 


#####

first game i was looking forward to in the new year and refunded the game play is so boring you think there is a lot to the game going over the tutorial but then quickly realize your just doing the same thing over and over again with really no effects on your citytown your building as others have said it is very shallow

#####

i dont understand what all the negativity is all about the game is decent of course there could be some improvement here and there such as a skirmish mode but its not really worth all the negative reviews at this moment if you like political games this game is for you if not then go play something else

#####

ok please bare with me i will update this later but just a little review for thoose pondering wether to buy so far i am only on ear 1  this reveiw will change

so far so good its fun if not a little on the repetitive side this might just be the way i have choose to play as im not really to bothered about the votes most of them seem to go my way without me really trying watching the city grow is nice and the modifying of districts to help them evolve is super cool its a slow paced game and if you try to speed it up manally you end up in all sorts of trouble

except for the odd dilema and the reasearch the game kinda slowly pushes you forward there isnt much to do it but make some choices sit around waiting for income to come in make some more choices 

overall a well made interesting concept if you like city builders i would recomend this  i think at the moment its just a tad repetitve  and easy i seem like im cluelessy playing and doing pretty well for someone just giving it a test run

#####

very relaxing  shame the game got shafted

#####

the good the game has a brilliant idea you have either governance games paradox or city builders but this one marries the two ideas into a handson governance game few games such as this exist best one being probably tropico 4 i think this goes even beyond tropico in terms of depth with the existence of formal votes and political parties so kuddos to the creators for thinking about such an interesting concept

the bad well the game gets repetitive very fast as the political mechanics do the same thing over and over again there is no sandbox mode per se at this stage and the optimization is poor without the graphics or the underlying mechanics being something to go wow about the game runs slowly and camera controls are wonky tropico 5 runs faster and has even better graphics and larger maps lastly the interface is horrendous nonintuitive and difficult to master fonts are small and many players myself included had trouble saving the game due to the insistence on a new save name or ingame actions due to poor instructions 

sadly on top of a fairly high cost at 45 i expect this game not to become a dlc rally point the poor features make me go for no for this game and i intend to request a refund

#####

its fun at the beginning and then it becomes a slug in both gameplay and how the game runs i cant recommend this game zero replay factor and i tried i really tried

#####

why you should buy this game
 roleplay element in simcity game let you soak in a little more is fun to lead a family generation after generation
 graphics are decent
 simple to play but complex to understand
 the vote system makes the game more interesting
 balancing your income is kinda fun when you try to minmax the gameplay
 district upgrade system
 some nice events with humor sadly less and less later in game
 technology tree is simple but fun

why not to buy this game
 serious performace issue later in game 30fps you wish this must be patched or the game is not playable
 politycal parties do not make sense when voting for example before voting the game shows you that all parties are strongly against women right to vote base on their idealogy it is 1800 so you know but when voting they like 90 for it
 more or less pointless edicts system not enough information what is going on
 small maps comparing to city skyline it is like building on 1 plot out of 9
 technology tree is not clear enough

i would recomend to buy this game for 25 or less it is more or less how much i have payed the game is fun but need some serious work and optymization 
also this is small studio project so i expected nomansky2 thats probly why i kinda like this game my expectations arent to big for it

#####

i thought that this game would be both wide with city building and deep with politics but the game doesnt really seem to do either particularly well the cities practically build themselves with little strategic demands from the player and politics get repetitive as you need the council to approve anything you want to do and most of the time theyre going to approve it   im very disappointed in this game it has a lot of potential but it doesnt seem like the devs are going to fix it ill update this review if the game improves

#####

no support and lack of content beware do not purchase

#####

refunded

the game is tedious slow and very little information is given regarding what outcome you can expect from any action the fonts are small and graphics are poor 

this game is not worth 3499

i really wanted to like it but i couldnt

#####

i hated this game when it first came out and jumped on the this game is sht bandwagon i watched quill18 play it and reinstalled it its actually not a bad game i kinda like it now

#####

if you like niche games youve come to the right place the game plays out as promised  you get to be the mayor of a newly founded city and you struggle to have your dynasty keep control thourgh almost 200 years of history 

as per release im not sure i would recommend it i did fairly enjoy the game so far but it feels repetetive and somewhat voyeur the engine hasnt been optimized and so perfomance is somewhat dissappointing even on low graphics i realize that this means more to the maisntream gamer which is also why this is marked as not recommended

but credit goes where credit is due  the politics system works quite well you feel that you can actively make a change parties can become more popular if you support their agendas and edicts make a noticable impact on your citys economy there is a lot of different ways for a campaign to play out even on a single map i dont regret buying the game but its not one that i would shout praises for without hesitation

#####

this is a great idea poorly implemented

aside from the many bugs and general poverty of useful explanation or clarity around the mechanics its essentially just quite boring quite quickly and with very little promise of being replayable there certainly are some nice ideas and in the short term its a better political management game than the likes of the democracy series but the repetition and the sheer frustration of wondering why the economy is behaving as it is kill your enthusiasm perhaps with some essential patches and extensions of clarity and purpose it can be redeemed but as of now its not worth your money

#####

i keep trying to like this game and get into it but at no point are any of the mechanics explained the guides on steam by the community likewise are a bunch of people fumbling about the game is just a mess which is a shame because it could be fun i go back to it every once in a while to try to figure out the rules but really why bother play something thats good instead

#####

the game attempts to combine city building and politics and fails in both aspects both of these features lack proper depth and lack replayability after the first game due to their repetitive nature the city building lacks proper customisability and when the city gets too large the game crawls to a very low fps

the council is poorly implemented parties will become defunct in the next era no matter how popular they are within the city the only real interaction with the council is threatening or spying on them to pass a law

the game can be summed up in three features place a district change taxes and pass a very linear set of laws every game the game has a good concept but a very bad execution

#####

not realy going to down this game but it plays nothing like what i was thinking if you like a game where you really have not much to do than this is for you it plays nothing like any city builder cuz its not i think if they put the option to design your own dynasty then it may be cooler but really theres not alot to do mabey to much political sim for me
no thumbs up but no thumbs down either i had to give it a thumbs down cuz they made me sry kalypso

#####

i had to refund this game it has 0 content get repetetive really really fast its just a shell of a game with absurde politics gameplay

#####

i was unable to get a refund so i gave it another try one month since release i still cannot save game properly even if i turn off the tutorial mode this is a ripoff

#####

game abandoned dont waste your money

#####

hey guys i have played this game for quite some hours now and these are my thoughts about the game

at first the game is really promising the concept is great and i was really looking forward to it

first problems first the game is badly optimized i cannot get through the second part of the game lag i have read the forums and this seems to be happening a lot to people so if you do not have a good pc do not buy the game at this moment

then in my first playthroughs i was really struggling getting the hang of the game mechanics it was a decently challenging game and i liked it but after like 1015 hours i knew exactly how to play the game 

so for me now this game is way to easy after only 15 hours of playtime i know exactly what to do
then it also seems that there is only one way to rule if you want to succeed liberal  progressive thinking
furthermore convincing the council seems to be a big part of the game however if you build your districts correctly and research in a smart way they will allways vote yes it comes down to wether you have a positive tax rate
with my playstyle i got up to 750k  tax rate per month 40000 citizens wol happiness 910 and i almost finished all era 3 inventions being at the end of era 2 at this moment i cannot continue due to the lag

at the current stage of the game it was not worth the 40 euros

to improve the game they should focus on
 optimalization
 adding a layer of depth
 more pathways to succes
 in depth politics more agenda of the parties instead of just needing good taxes
 more trade offs for being progressive  liberal
 more benefits for not moving forward

this would greatly improve the game

at the moment i am almost done playing this game and 3540 hours of gameplay for 40 euros just does not cut it

i hope this review gives some help in making a decision

#####

i do not recommend this game because it is very repetetive and has no replayability and none of the choices you make in this game have any visible effect the game pulls you along a ride in a 3999 history lesson

#####

i was really looking forward to this game after watching writing bulls lets play but the game has some of the bugs he was mentioning in his lets play and if u try to make sense on what desicion is the right one in every situation you will be frustated by the random game response you can just influence every political party the same way you can build industry and the left wing supports you while the party of the worker does not even if there are not enough jobs the idea is great its just the implementation which seams to be pretty random and not at all realated to real world potics

#####

i waited months for this game to come out while the first play through was very rewarding i feel the replay value of this game is extremely lacking every game seems the same you follow the same path to win you raise taxes to build more infrastructure then raise more taxes to pay for it if the politics in in were more complex and we could call it a full blown political sim with city building and management aspects that effect the politics of the game i probably wouldnt put the game down but as its currently constructed it gets boring fast i think they have an awesome idea and a potential for a great game as it is at the moment of this review its lacking content to make it that game

#####

i enjoy it but its not worth 40 and has some issues with it not well balanced

#####

abandond by the devs  i hoped for fixs but no no no you aint getting that 

#####

i had really high hopes for this game it looked like an intriguing twist on the citybuilder genre unfortunately the twist ie the city politics is onedimensional and totally lacking in interaction with the other factions your family choice seems to have no bearing on the gameplay other than the odd event which pops up every couple of years and the lack of customisation is a shocking misstep perhaps when basing a game around family dynasties kalypso could have looked at the success seen by paradox with their crusader kings ii series

then theres the gameplay itself it is completely impossible to run a city at a profit if you want it to grow or if you want it to have even basic amenities like schools and police stations you find yourself raising taxes to ridiculous levels which has no impact on businesses or people or begging the emperor for a loan for some reason having a port or train station actually loses you money as if those two crucial pieces of infrastructure were unable to make a profit wholly unrealistic

if those basic things can be changed ie the entire economics of the game and if the politics can be made interesting rather than repetitive ie the entire basis of the game and if more options for customising characters were made ie the entire plot of the game then this would be worth some money currently it is not and should never have been released in this state

#####

if the creators of this game got together with the creators of democracy they might have a full game on their hands and a fun one too but without that this game is really shallow the original simcity had more complexity

#####

h1 this game is the best thing i have ever played here is why you should ignore the comment section h1

this game isnt being given the credit it deserves the council is not at all annoying unless you want to propose a fucking train station while 2 million dollars in debt im glad the game doesnt give you a debt limit before automaticly ending the game it put political penalties that would behave just like the real world i love how amazing the political and economic systems are and how in depth they have created them and connecting the systems to affect each other when i bought this i expected the worst not knowing the devs and ususally the type to listen to the people but i now have one of the greatest games in my steam library and i think you should too for all the salty dipshits that downvoted this game why as i see it this should be at the top of the strata charts

#####

first of all  this game shouldnt be compared to city builder games because it has a completely different approach to the city management with more emphasis on the family politics and different era characteristics 

you actually kind of macromanage districts with not much room to manipulate like you are able to in typical city builder games the game leads you through some of the most interesting eras of modern history with all the global crisis affecting your little city as well you develop technologies to boost your industry and commerce propose edicts to balance out some of the issues you might have in your city you make taxing changes etc in my opinion it all feels moderately complex although it has quite a lot features

now the biggest problem that i personally have with the game is the transparency after a couple of playthroughs i still have no idea why some of the issues appear in this game and i cannot pinpoint the source of the problem in order to find a way to resolve it i feel like the game is missing more clear ui explanation of the various stats that your companies have that affect their success and so on there should be a lot better advisor system in my opinion

overall  the game is fun and it has a kind of a fresh approach to the city game genre it does make you play it a couple of times which i tend to value the most in games however it does not justify the price it should be priced at about 20 at most because it lacks the complexity to be valued more 

6510

#####

theres nothing wrong with this game its fun and surprisingly difficult optimization could be a little bit better and it should be a little bit cheaper 1999 but overall i recommend it

#####

excellent political simulation on an urban level like power  revolution for cities  
despite simple techniques there is a lot to learn and achievements like providing electricity before 1900 or finally shutting down the gas infrastructure a few years later feel like a great accomplishment

oh and screw the steam reviews i bought the game 4 years after release because the reviews were so bad what a bunch of bullshit

#####

i disagree with the mostly negative review rating ive played alot of city builders but none this unique its more like a political rpg with city building elements theres alot you can do in this game lots of options and paths you can take 

pros
the dynamic events gives you chance to get boosts and curry favor with politcal parties 
currying favor with political parties to get bills past
chosing upgrades then proposing a bill to vote on
good tutorial
watching the city seeing new building being built and upgraded 
simple city building with new options being unlocked over time
choosing new technologies to persue unlock a ton of new options 
living history the politcial parties will change after each era reflecting current events 

cons
the game does feel rushed feels like devs were trying to do too much and ran out of timemoney lots of unique ideas not fully realized 
lacks polish i think this is where most of the problems stem from some things just arent well explained or confusing 
graphics are disappointing and look bland    

final verdict
it was rushed and overpriced but still a fun and unique game i do recommend it but get it at 50 off i really hope they make an urban empire 2 but take their time with it

#####

dead game do not buy no updates waste of money dead in development

#####

guiding a city through 200 years of development while you wheel and deal to stay in power sounds fantastic unfortunately this just doesnt live up to the concept you spend most of your time waiting for technology to develop pushing through edicts that dont seem to ever have any real downsides and occassionally updating your districts with new infrustructure that will most likely send you into bankrupcy

the scale and scenario just dont seem right its more town neighbourhood management rather than city management a bigger city with less control would have actually been more interesting and would then make more sense as to why every area needed to be plugged into the grid seperately theres alot of stats showing which districts are voting  which way but if theres a way influence this significantly i havent found it also each era wipes out these trends and replaces them without any seemily coherent logic

lastly theres just alot of rough edges to this game tooltips that occassionaly tell you what will happen with a choice but not always a storyline thats meant to be about each of these ruling families in the city but which seems completely disconnected from the rest of the game and very underbaked 

hopefully other developers take this concept and run with it because theres definitely something here unfortunately this just doesnt feel like anything other than a good concept

#####

fun game ideas decent execution on some of them notsogood on a lot of them and then there is the performance problem or the complete lack of performance 
if the performance wasnt so godawful it could be a fun game if a bit silly and random in its political simulation but if i cant actually play the game well not much fun to be had

lets take it stepbystep

1 politics
fun idea fun when it works properly but often it doesnt the political compass doesnt translate into sensible parties sensible as in resembling reality to some degree and there is no way to tell how you are being placed on that compass you might think you are a leftleaning liberal but when mayoral elections come along all the rightwing centrists support you and the progressives are the ones that vote against you why no way to find out
nevertheless if you suspend your disbelief and have dont expect the compass to be anything remotely realistic it is an interesting barrier mechanic you have to work your way around devs should just throw out the realistic names and connotations and just run with the underlying mechanics

2 ui and useability
ui itself is decent if a little action heavy too many clicks to accomplish some things not too hard to use or learn the problem is there is a big lack of feedback and general information about what is gonig on in the city and what the consequences of your actions are 
why is the restaurant industry making more money than the next 10 combined while not having a sales boost or booming demand no clue 
why are the elite and lower classes unemployed no clue the industry tabs only shows middle and working class jobs per category 
why are all these businesses bankrupt in this one district but not in the one next to it no clue i can look at all of them individually but it only tells me the current situation not any of the causes
incomprehensible tooltips galore where figuring out if the 5 figure on a red downwardsarrow accompanied icon is a good thing or not is a matter of trialanderror 
some decisions in events have no tooltip but if the previous choice had one it remains displayed confusing the player 

3 variety and replayability
barely any of either game is fairly linear with far too few choices 
a grand total of 3 maps are present currently but since the maps make no difference in how the game plays there might as well be 300 one of the maps states that the mining industry would be a defining economic force due to mountains and such well that does not in any way translate into game mechanics i tried all three maps and had pretty much the exact same industry composition on all of them
 the 4 families are fun additions they can make you play somewhat differently good idea expand upon this

4 and the big bugbear performance
specs i54670 34ghz gf970 16gb1866 ram 256gb ssd
scenario 1 max quality 1080p 1914 city of 45k people era 3 techs all unlocked
result 1 216 fps on 2x speed 522 on 1x speed 1015 second freezes every 34 months unplayable on higher speeds freezes every couple seconds

scenario 2 lowest quality 1080p 1914 city of 45k people era 3 techs all unlocked
result 2 1525 fps on 2x speed 2030 on 1x speed 510 second freezes every 34 months barely playable on higher speeds

having taken a much smaller city 15k people to 1936 while still having 3040 fps on 2x speed it seems that population increases and number of districts severely limits performance in the game
this is the one that kills it for me if im doing well the game becomes unplayable very fast until the performance issue is solved i cant recommend this game

this game shouldve been released to early access and sit there for a couple months until it is fully baked then release it

#####

this game realy got alot better since the updates
its still hard but not near inpossible as it seemed to me in the start

i have had alot of good hours on this game now since i started it recently
if you like management games where you cannot control evrything directly make sure to give it a try



#####

this game is not for everyone  i cannot stress this point enough  it is not cities skylines or simcity or whatever else you want it to be  as a political ruling simulator it is successful in its purpose  if that is not something you are interested in please do not buy it as you will feel disappointed and review this game poorly because your expectations were not met

#####

this game is not perfect by any means but it is a good game and has a very solid concept you basically play as one of 4 families and like it says you play as a mayor make choices and what not it is a game with many different ways to complete it or do things and i recommend it for anyone who likes games where you have to think about your decisions and for people who like choices

#####

at the moment not recommended i built a very good layout of industry living space and room for buissness so all the demands were set but still the city was total broke all the time also the political partys do not even make sense lol the conservative party is leaning left like wtf you smoking over there at kalypso update it seems you cant build any form of gas lighting or you go broke back then the saudis did not price gouge as far as i know also after you build a bigger city that really was only like 20 of the map big then my game went down to 20 fps i have a gtx 1080 oc and i7 4 ghz cpu so nice optmized game looooooooool

youre not a god youre a mayor with your hands tied who has to answer to the city council and the citizens its a challenge good luck

urban empire has elements of democracy banished and a little bit of simcity but with a lot more variables 

yes you can create districts plop train staions and ports or turn on the gas and electricity but youre not doing any of that without the votes you need to make decisions that gain you support of the councillors while making decisions that are prosperous for the citizens and businesses its a balancing act

although there are several pages of data to ponder while planning your decisions the feedback is not explained very well however after playing more than two or three hours you start to see how it all works together

the graphics and sound are very nice the ui is well organized and easy to navigate i have experienced no bugs and it runs fine on my four year old laptop

so for those who are patient with an interest in politics and city planning give it a try

#####

game has balacing issues unfortunately 

i think its very good point of view to a city management game unfortunately its economy system is too unbalanced city service costs and district building cost incredibly high on the other hand people need for service buildings are very high even at the begining this ending up with the very unhappy population 

also worker rights and some other humanitarian right are demanded by people too early so this causes very high costs for industry again ending up very unhappy businesses

to sum up everyhing in economic system tend to go unhappy at the very first beginging even at the tutorial i have had a bankrupt so game has good potential but requires some adjustments

#####

i wish i could give this a positive because it is a good game and i do enjoy the graphics the concept the watching of my city as it grows the budget juggling and politics of this story that you play
but

this is supposed to be a game though it ends up feeling like a story that youre watching the political parties in this game can be held back and resisted for a while you cant control the population to influence the elections so youre at the mercy of the games random mechanics which are poorly explained the horrible lack of tooltips giving you any information about anything and everything you cant even find out a why business went out of business or why its bankrupt or who works where or how to help citizens improve 

and the political parties eventually you cant do anything but accept their utter rule over you and the policies you enact for your city even if youre highly opposed to them and have been for the entirity of the game 

i respect that democracy is showcased here but thats exactly whats wrong with this game in the hours ive played it i did have fun and ill probably continue to have fun but i dont feel like im a part of the game or my city or my leader i feel like im merely watching them play their story 

it makes me appreciate games where i find myself looking at the clock and realising a few hours have passed because it was enjoyable 

wait until its on sale or the bugs have been fixed and the ai improved

thank you for reading and i wish you well

#####

a great game

until the devs ran with the money

#####

very specialized game which is not for everyone 
if youre not interested in politics history education managing you probably do best when avoiding this game
probably fit only to casual players
very badly optimized  you should have very good procesor and ram to experience smooth game

#####

i bought into the hype spent 40 bucks deeply regret it the economics seem off the city unresponsive for example having a train station sea port or certian infustructure upgrades are suppossed to help industry and commerce yet when installed little to no improvement is seen it seems impossible to afford expansion and upgrades the game could be good but the way it is now is just down right unejoyable which i really hate to saying being i had such high hopes for this game

#####

i wasnt really sure about this game after i washed a lot of videos on you tube

pro

new type of city building special the council part
lots of diferent type of events what give you the chance to play that game again and it could have a iferent outcome 
lot of hystoric background well researched 
lots of goverment and invastructer building 

cons

game look like been rushed out many many bug that made the game unstable and not really good to play buit thanks for the idea how to fix it
lots of areas have so much potential but have not been really finished punlic transport self deciding where it goes
plan tool to creat new districts are sluggy and make it sometime really to hard to creat a nice dirstric soecial the roads are not well place on any optin

price for that game is typicly kalipso style and by fare over the top and need at least reduce to 25 gbp 

result 

this game schould be go back in open beta because for me it looks like a godd open beta what need a lot of patching up
there is high potential in this game and if the game maker stay behind there game than i think this game can be a good game 

i recomand this game for the steam 2 hour trail where you can get refound if you decidet this is not a game for you

#####

game couldve been good had they fixed all of the bugs as it stands it sits here abandoned not worth anybodys time

#####

i saw a video calling this tropico like but sadly it doesnt seem to have any of the charm but then again tropico 5 was a huge disappointment too so maybe its time to just write off kalypso entirely

this game really needs a better tutorial  the tutorial in the game left me going into massive debt with no clue how i can actually affect anything if you dont massively increase taxes you can barely pay for the school you have to build for the tutorial never mind the grid upgrades you are later have to build as part of the tutorial  
you occasionally get asked to make certain decisions but with no way of knowing the result it might as well be random eg vienna style gas lighting vs french style gas lighting vs british style gas lighting  how the hell am i supposed to make an educated decision about which style of gas lighting is best for my city
whats more despite picking a campaign i never saw any objectives or any hint as to what the goal of the game might be hit some target population hit some target income hit some target tech level 
it just looks like simcity with everything removed rci is chosen for you roads are picked for you by the game with ubiquitous time wasting votes which keep playing time wasting vote count animations every single time 

if there is fun to be had i didnt find it and i am not invested enough to give up my refund to find out

#####

this game has intersting concepts but fail in the long term when everything is just way liniar to play it feels like it lacks something that ought to give it more personality but instead its just a mouse click fest which is annoying in the long run 

but for now this game is just not and wait and see if they plan on adding more features to this game

#####

it is not a city builder you are a mayor if you want to take political decisions and spend your time voting  threatening  pleading other politicals paties this game is for you it is a strategical game first time aroud nobody wanted to vote for me so my city stopped working properly and and lost 2nd time around i was losing more than 50k a month so i went bankrupt when the mother state stopped giving me money i guess the 3rd time is gonna be the good one or not

#####

when i first read about this upcoming game many months ago i thought this was going to be a dream of mine come true a hybrid between cities in motion tropico cities skylines and civilization a city and development planner with a strong historical perspective unfortunately i experienced a sobering jolt to reality when the game was finally released mouse control is a nightmare laggy and jerky and with the keyboard the usual fallback for cases like this cf cim2 its not much better too few zoom levels too many new windows open up where you have to click okay every time the gameplay is repetitive there is no alluring atmosphere no special mood that makes you feel something  i really wanted to like this game and the games i listed above may have set very high standards but even though i dont think i am very demanding i regret to have to say that this game has been a huge disappointment to me i am not certain whether future updates may be able to improve the situation greatly but i will not give up hope especially with the developers coming across as being really competent as well as likeable in their videos

#####

good fun for a while with great potential but seems to be abandoned

#####

the game is fun up to a point but if you make one little mistake it sets off a snowball reaction that is absolutely impossible to to recover from your punished for raising taxes your punished for lowering taxes your punished for building infrastructure your punished for everything rewards are few and far between game is horribly balanced further more the random events for you to make a decision but give you no information to make an informed one i was asked once in game to decide which person had a better idea about something 0 data on what their idea was what effect it would have nothing add all this to no mod support and you have a game that could have been great but ended up a dud when asked about mod support the devs said it would be too costly yet mods could fix this game and make it great very disappointed

#####

tldr it plays like a really basic city builder that delays construction when youve gotten into the swing of things this should be early access at best it needs loads of refining to be anywhere near what they have been showcasing

its 1960 my people are quite happy with my governing of the city theres no water lines sewage pipes or electric anywhere within the city despite this the television business is booming not sure how my people intend to watch the tvs but i cant judge them
the roads are still the same old dirt roads from the 1800s everyone is happy to drive around their cars on this with minimal traffic problems
the communist party is quite happy for me to raise tax on the working class and lower it for the elite

the game boasts having an indepth political system where you need to battle with different parties to make changes but theres no point at all in picking favourites to buddy up with as all relations with these parties will reset back to 0 after a couple of years so you can generally treat them how you want
city expansion only becomes a problem if you have both a low income and low funds in the account as then all parties will try to block all decisions you make however if youre sitting there with a few hundred k in the bank they will generally green light everything you want to do like build an electrical power plant purely to export the power it creates
the parties as well are not really sticking to what you think they would you will quite often see the conservatives pushing for social equality with the progressive sides trying to block these movements and as mentioned before communists liking to tax the working class high

the people in your city are quite happy to live with no water electric or gas supplies you can add these services to districts but you get no return for doing so people wont pay extra for them so youre just throwing money away they do claim to boost companies but again increasing the sales of companies in your city doesnt actually do anything for your own income

the rpg story elements hardly do anything for the game you can choose one of 4 families with different back stories and ideas towards governing all switching between these really does it decide which events youre going to get and they will be the same ones each time at the exact same time you get a few outside of this like parties wanting to make you honourary members etc but theyre mostly meaningless 
your character has traits cruel soft opitmist etc again mostly meaningless you might get the odd event pop up with a response option blocked due to lack of x trait but refering back your traits and what you say on these windows rarely matters

until elections come around you dont need to make your citizens happy at all no chance of an uprising due to lack of healthcare policing leisure or anything at all you can quite happily ignore all the demands of your citizens until the ability to vote comes along and you can even try to prevent that for an extended time

small aesthetic thing that bothers me why can i see loads of cars driving around my city when ive not even researched them yet also why do all the houses and shops have lights on at night if theres absoloutely no electrical grids in the city

the game had some great ideas with the whole political thing you can even blackmail parties but they just dont mean anything towards running the city you can spend the entire game never having to speak to any of them apart from suggesting changes to the city and waiting for them to agree on it
and the fact that you can have a city with 0 utilities and everyone is ok with that bewilders me but then you cant afford to give them to the entire city anyway



#####

im quite enjoying it so far a nice take on the city building genre

#####

its slow and underwelming the gameplay is very repetetive

#####

i bought it on sale for 600 dont pay more than that

#####

game is okbut has performance issues 

also other issues like the devs released 2 patches witch included no fixes or improvements just transaltions for more languages hopting to make a few quick bucks before jumping ship 

which they have done now 

so officially 1 dec posted on the forums for 2 months now they ignore completely 

utter rubbish and gisgraceful 

btw this is a calypso tactic they have done the same on the last few games be warned about everything they release

#####

no updates since january

#####

this game has a lot of interesting elements and aspects to it that i have never seen in another game of this type  i just really like the political element where you have to politic with the various factions to get votes  thats very realistic

the learning curve is definitely steep and it is easy to push forward with a lot of what a player might believe are good to have governmentalcitysocial changes policies and funding bills that can quickly eat up your budget and put you into a death spiral towards bankruptcy thus it is critical to pace yourself and even more critical is to not push hard with all the factions on every bill that comes before you and the council  if you do that you will ultimately alienate the council and when it comes time that you really do need their help they wont be responsive  saying you owe me one you owe me one you owe me one will result in no we dont we already helped you again and again and again go away 

instead just like in real life you must pick and choose which bills are important and critical to get passed by the council and either delay or ignore the others

there are other players that have gone in to detail on how to successfully manage city growth  budget so i wont dive into that  

finally it is important to keep in mind that you are managing a city in a lesser developed country  it is not imperative that every district in your town have all the most modern amenities  if some parts of town do not have a natural gas grid or still use cobblestone or dirt roads but installing such infrastructure will wreck your budget going forward then dont do it  for example i live in the heart of downtown atlanta i recently learned that 100 years ago 1920s all the streets north of my building were unpaved dirt roads  electricity was installed in the area in the 1940s and the first streetlights were installed in late 1950s  your budget must be constrained by what your tax base can support not what looks pretty  

self restraint is the hardest aspect of the game  modernizing your city and implementing social equality must be paced against what the people demand vs what is nice to have  master that and you will find the game a rewarding experience

easily my favorite politicalcity management game hands down  if youre looking for urban planner games play cities skylines  if you want to play mindless dystopia try workers and resources soviet republic

#####

lots of bugs currently but even so the game is playable but overall has very limited play

there is a learning curve to figure out the politics that the tutorial doesnt explain very well at all

i have had no crashes but did get a popup with no mulitple choice options normally they all do which basicly ruined the game because there was nothing to do to get rip of it like so

httpsteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid847977508

so once you have your whole land filled with districts which is very easy to do and have complete coverage for service buildings there is not much do but research and do upgrades of the buildings and vote at that point you end playing the game at max fast forward speed

i wouldnt say it is boring for the game type it is i just expect to do more

the game will be playable once the bugs are fixed but how long will you play is the question 

i will be playing more to try to get a the last era without a game killing bug but it might be ewasier to wait for a patch



#####

was expecting a tropico like game got some boring repitive game with poorly thought out districts and extremely poor graphics no voice acting is a let down but to be expected at this pricepoint the game does tend to text spam you

#####

i really wanted to like this game it has been on my wishlist for months but ultimately it fell flat on my expectations 

it is ridiculously overpriced for what it is i would not be refunding it if it were a 5 or 10 gamebut no it is a 40 game and that is ridiculous for what it is on the surface it gives off the impression of being a city builder and being complex but it is not once you have played for an hour you realise just how repetitive the game is and how lacking in content diversity and complexity it really is

not worth the asking price

#####

this game is sold as a city builder that requires you to work with the council in order to get stuff passed however all your problems can be solved by threatening everyone and raising taxes to max which in turn takes away any sense of strategy or any need to work with any groups its a bad attempt at a simulation i played way over the fun level because i wanted to see if somehow it would be rewarding the further in you got it wasnt

#####

so much wasted potential i really wanted to love this game but i just cant its boring it really is i study politics for fun and i find this boring and whats with the city building parts why are services so bloody expensive gah i want to like this so much and i just dont

#####

very boring game 
i was expecting a more complicated or challenging game the game mechanics is not robust and it does not seem to work together very well  i only played few hrs so there might b things i dont know yet but i could not continue it is boring

#####

first let me say the idea of a mayor sim is a great idea problem is that the game plays less like a sim and more like a story board that your stuck following still not a bad attempt and i still find the story interesting 

sadly there are bugs the map one that seems to affect alot of people i got one where i had a pop up that wouldnt go away ended up alting out without being able to save my game 

other problem is its performance later in the game at the beginning you can spam build your city and grow the whole area of the map a couple years in all the gameplay videos it showed more a thought process this isnt true spam away and 23 years city is as large as yo ucan make it sadly around 1860 the map starts to freeze up and lag at 1900 it stutters enough its distracting i have a super computeraround 32 gigs of ram and nothing ever lags so its the game not me

#####

very fun but difficult learning curve you will most likly go in debt or lose the first times

#####

i bought this game the day of release and have only now decided to leave a review i thought id wait and give them time to update and fix any problems there have been no updates and the game is still about as fun as a spinning top just a little more repetative 
as far as shaping your city by making decisions on policy that is only true for about 5 minutes and then the game will repeatedly ask you about that policy until you bend to the games will do what it thinks is best 
the zoning isnt anywhere near immersive enough yay i made a zone that looks and feels like every other zone in the game 
honestly i feel like this was a half assed job and for a game that ushers in progression i feel like it is more stagnant than the mississippi bayou

#####

the game is full of bugs also it feels like you doing the same thing over and over not worth the price tag hopefully they add some additional content to it

#####

do not purchase game is abandoned no news no patches overpriced

#####

dont buy it i am nuts for political sims in any shape and enjoy tycoon kind of games and played this game for 4 hours just to realize how lacking it is i was deceived by the idea behind this game which sounded marvelous however the game is very very shallow it is only a council voting simulation with very few options and even less logical on the issues and parties the votation on the council is the heart of the game in fact it is the game everything else gravitates this for example you put light on the district  for almost no effect in playablility and then you have to approve it on the council exactly as you would do to approve womans rights exactly in the same way and with no logic on it if you played the guild 2 and was at the council of the city election you will have much much more fun and logic abou it  i just asked for the refund the game was not what was promised

#####

presentation is very nice and enjoying the gameplay so far which is interesting worth picking up on sale if youre looking for a city development game with a focus on political decision making and voting

note that this game is graphically demanding considering its genre so you will need a decent gpu to play at decent frame rate which imo for a game like this shouldnt be such a limiting factor but it is

#####

this is a really cool split off of a typical city simulation game the fact that you have an era and technology tree along with political parties can be a bit overwhelming however its something that makes this game great and different from what you see in normal games

#####

great politics  citybuilder simulation game it has everything i have ever wanted in a citybuilding game for me it is quite entertaining and capitivating although some people may not be interested in managing a citys taxes and electrical grid while trying to balance a budget to me it is very fun

there are a few bugs and some inconsistency with regards to tooltips but im sure they will get patched away quickly 

all in all great game and i look forward to seeing it grow and develop and for my city to grow and develop

#####

urban empire is not as much a city builder as a political strategy game it definitely takes a bit to get used to but so far it has been a deep and very enjoyable experience

#####

repetitive and bland gameplay with barely any meaningful decisions to make

#####

reborn games is one of the biggest scammer 

dont buy this crap

#####

i really want to like this game but the way it currently plays is both frustrating and obfuscated it really is a city builder game with a very awkward do not pass go council screen passing for the difference between builder and ruler ultimately it starts getting in the way it needs to be streamlined to be less offensive to the continuing gameplay

then theres the mechanics of how and why your city grows or doesnt grow very few of the factors are fully explained to the point where you can comprehend them and utilise or react to them properly a very slight change to your city perhaps even a change to just the citys potential and not even to its physical nature eg upgrade a district to potentially have higher density buildings and suddenly everyone might move out sending you into a debt spiral you can never recover from

then there are storydriven decisions you have to make will you the major endorse x or y etc some of them reveal their consequences in terms of modifications to various stats and some of them dont there appears to be no rhyme or reason for the latter

the game is also pretty poor on the graphical front ignore the lovely closeups in the trailers youll never be looking at your city like that and even if you do take a moment to zoom in it really isnt impressive in the flesh as your city grows so does your framerate slow even on a massively overclocked i7 and watercooled 1080gtx it tanks completely as the city gets larger eventually it crashes raising the ghost of a possible memory leak



#####

this game is worth maximum 20    
this game brings fun for 510 hours

#####

this game seems to have been rushed to publication a great number of spelling and also grammatical errors in the english version certainly hints at that as well as severe memory leaks in endgame which make the experience very laggy 

i like the concept of the game and i like its challenges however the voting system that allows the player to stay in office  or not  seems arbitrary all of a sudden parties who like you and who you have positive standing with will vote against you it is a frustrating aspect that makes restarting a scenario a burden instead of an enjoyable prospect to play the game with a new focus 

i do enjoy the game and would like to recommend it at this point but it would not be a heartfelt recommendation

#####

the good the game has a brilliant idea you have either governance games paradox or city builders but this one marries the two ideas into a handson governance game few games such as this exist best one being probably tropico 4 i think this goes even beyond tropico in terms of depth with the existence of formal votes and political parties so kuddos to the creators for thinking about such an interesting concept

the bad well the game gets repetitive very fast as the political mechanics do the same thing over and over again there is no sandbox mode per se at this stage and the optimization is poor without the graphics or the underlying mechanics being something to go wow about the game runs slowly and camera controls are wonky tropico 5 runs faster and has even better graphics and larger maps lastly the interface is horrendous nonintuitive and difficult to master fonts are small and many players myself included had trouble saving the game due to the insistence on a new save name or ingame actions due to poor instructions 

sadly on top of a fairly high cost at 45 i expect this game not to become a dlc rally point the poor features make me go for no for this game and i intend to request a refund

#####

reading through some of these reviews and some of them are pretty heavy handed  so instead of pros and cons praises and complaints expectations vs realities  ill just give you what it is

list
    macro manager  there are very few things that you actually place aside from the district layout and select services
    political player  work your way around 3 political parties who vote on every single decision that you make that requires funds or increasing taxes  but use your political favors wisely as eventually you will have to run for reelection
    popular populist  meet the needs of your people through six avenues all of which add up to their overall happiness
     techological leader  work your way through an expansive tech web that starts with advancements from the 1800s all the way to modern times  each tech gives you expansive capabilites and services that you can improve your town with
     financial guru  this is the most important  without profitable revenue you will go no where  which is really easy to do
list

all these requires a balance to get you through the game  some need a lot of attention while others will sneak on you at the worst possible moment  my biggest piece of advice is to restart as soon as you get a grasp of the mechanics of the game  the tutorial goes too slow and your district building should be rapid in the early game  

overall i recommend this game to those who are curious about the macro style mechanics of the game and do not mind throwing a few extra bucks at a developer who tried to do something new and interesting

#####

tldr dont waste your money hoping that they fix it eventually or have the balls to sell you a dlc that implements what should have been in the core game


this game is great in concept and very very poor in implementation i have played to completion a few times and can say this
1	llaaaaagggggg  regardless of others saying it plays fine if you are a successful mayor and get 1015k population by around era 3 the game will crawl i have ssds 32gb ram and a 6 core cpu with ht and it is literally single fps by the time you hit era 5 there is no way they didnt notice this in development and yet they threw it out there anyways unacceptable
2	this appears to be based on some designers idea of how politics work choices you make may or may not do what you think they do and there is no information denoting what the overall effect might be i dont need the game to let me minmax but i would like to at least understand who supports various initiatives and what they are likely to vote for it feels like there is some formula but it is very unclear what that is this makes every decision very frustrating
3	when information is presented it is done in an awkward and confusing manner for example there are lots of stats about each district available but none of them cover what does this district need or how do i address problem x so even when there is info available it is still frustrating just trying to make sense of it
4	the engine designer must have done the ui also because the way things like bonuses are presented is horrible sales bonus demand 10 even if the engine calculated a bonus as 10 for something why in the world would you present it like that its just backwards
5	citizen desires which they call the wheel of life are presented as offsets to the current era target so you have a hard time understanding how much better you need to make things they should just show it as 1115 instead of 4 even then once you learn to understand what it means how to solve that issue is unclear
6	nothing has any consequence it doesnt matter what youve done or how you treat the parties vote for the most liberal policy available have money in the bank and the coucil will love you
7	citizens dont care if its the modern era and they have no utilities and dirt roads it makes no difference whatsoever you can buy off the vote and people still drive around on dirt roads if the game lets you see details you could see people checking stuff out on their ipads while walking along next to the cow droppings luckily the game doesnt let you zoom in  or out  enough to notice
as i said this game could be really good and after playing it a few times i can see where they were going with it but the developer just did a very bad job of putting it into action in a way that makes sense to most people sure you can learn how to read their numbers but i should have to work at learning the strategy not at figuring out how to read their statistics 
this is a 10 game with more polish than you would expect from that price range and a big publisher for 40 its early access at best and honestly im very skeptical of how deep the game would be even if it didnt have the litany of bugs there are literally mobile games with more complexity and better uis

#####

kinda just dull and in many ways broken the game is unpredictable and tedious such a shame because it looked like it could be brilliant in the hands of a different studio

#####

this game has a fun concept and i bought it onsale because the setting was intriguing i want very much to like this game but i cant really recommend it in its current state for all the data the game apparently provides there is no intuitive way to understand why businesses are failing or what the city needs to grow if there are any lists or charts of improvements i cant find them its maddening that there is apparently no citymap view to see where youve placed service buildings or to see at a glance which districts have which infrastructure installed the zoning layout or anything you would expect

finally and this is what prompted my review the game is still quite glitchy i cannot load any of my saved games  uninstalling and reinstalling did not work not very enthralled to have spent precious hours off from work to play a game i cannot finish ambitious idea that i wanted to love but i think ill go buy city skylines now

#####

i honestly think this is a fun game yes it has some flaws but what game doesnt  i really think it has potential but things need to be improved
 the business simulation is incredable in this i would compare it to the one in victoria 2 but the game never uses its potential the player never has to use it or try to improve something like boosting a specific industry or trying to get his city to develop a single industry
 i love the how there is a council and voting as a fan of politics and gaming i really like it but there should be more options more things to do
 love the tech tree
city contruction is okay but needs to be more specific
so if the developers added some updates added content this game really could be improved for now it is still a lump of coal but i believe it can be turned into a diamond

#####

pros theres alot of gametime experimenting with different strategies and figuring out what works best

cons the most profitable industry is one with no infastructure if you have 100 industry districts and upgrade youll make less money

each change in era causes massive changes i was doing great then it changed to era 4 commercial demand shot up industry and residential plumeted happiness and goodwill took a hit and there was nothing i could to to win

tutorial only hits the tip of the iceberg of what you need to know eg efficiency is determined by happiness of lower and working class and quality is determined by elites and middle class commercial can take care of most of you citizens demands if your taxing is right etc

pricetag even if these issues were resolved this game is only worth 30

dont get me wrong i am not one of those people who is giving a negative review because i suck at it i have had very successful cities the balance and other aspects of this game just make no sense

#####

im surprised there are so many negative reviews although ive read that the game was more difficult and buggy when it was launched so maybe thats partly why 

this game is like a blend between democracy 3 by positech games and simtown by maxis  except you cannot place every building road or tree in the city because that is not the focus of this game the tech tree evolves as time progresses from one era to the next unlocking new institutions and facilities as new tech is researched

the play style takes some getting used to with a large part of the game encouraging other councillors to vote the way you want them to once photography is developed in the tech tree you can spy on other parties in the council to dig up dirt on them to be used as leverage if you need to get a vote passed which they dont agree with

the political system does not make the game easy in places  it helps to have a fair bit of personal wealth behind your character in some instances to pay for institutions or changes to the city which the council does not approve of  but overall i think theyve struck a good balance between it being too easy and too difficult

since this game is a bit pricey given all the negative reviews i would recommend people wait until its on sale  anywhere from 10 to 15 usd or lower is good value for a game like this

#####

i actually really like the mix of city planning politics and rpg elements associated to your character it does need some performence help but thats something that can be improved by the devs it isnt perfect but it is a whole lotta fun
