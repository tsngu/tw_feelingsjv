veteran of the series here this review is for both new and old to the series
ive played 06 to completion first off do you need to play any of the prior games to understand the story here no not really at least know who some big characters like kiryu majima andor daigo are youll be fine and the game will tell you about returning characters anyways you dont need to play prior games to get into this one some characters will mention incidents that happen in prior games but theyre just mentions and not actually really relevant to this games plot anyways if youre new to yakuza id say this is a fine place to start if you want to start here and if you like rpg combat then youre pretty much good to go

prior games will help you have plenty of context to how things work in this universe and get familiar with some of the big names and bodies that are prevalent in every yakuza game however i dont feel like any of that information is absolutely required for this game

the rest of this review is just for veteran doubts or people who want more information

now first off despite how this game was marketed the main story is tonally what youd expect from a yakuza game its serious and full of that juicy crime drama content the story goes deep and has a lot of really fun and big moments that stand on their own two feet separate from the absurdity of the games wacky combat

which really just brings me to the combat its alright at first its really fun but as im approaching the end of the game i find there to be some awkward camera angles and sometimes where the ai hangs out or positions themselves in an arena is really obnoxious that and its just really absurd its hard to take the game seriously when one of your best options against that boss is shouting happy birthday before smashing them with a cake boss fights can get pretty annoying when you cant see shit because the characters are backing themselves into a wall also when characters are spread out its hard to perfect guard things when the camera is far away from another character and moves to said character being attacked but they get hit before the camera actually shows you whats going on im sure if a sequel to ichibans story comes out the more technical issues will get fixed at least just know that the combat is still fun and enjoyable its just very tonally inconsistent in places the past games werent because of it really only if you play with nondefault character jobs

if youre worried about the combat pace being slower or random encounters taking too long this game actually probably has some of the shortest random encounters in the series which is surprising that being said it also has really obnoxious spawning of enemies similar to yakuza 5s spawns in y5 youd finish a fight and theyd literally spawn another enemy 5 feet away from you i got an item that you can equip on a party member in chapter 12 that prevents enemies from spawning which is nice at least im unsure if it can be obtained earlier because its really damn annoying when enemies spawn in front of objectives enemies also have absurdly large aggro ranges and can forcestart a battle with you from literally across the street they really need to tone that down for future installments but it isnt a dealbreaker at all for the game

and now the final biggest thing would probably be the characters ichiban is a very strong followup to kiryu he possesses the same morals and such as kiryu but hes a charming dork instead of a stoic titan its very weird playing as kiryu for so many games and feeling unstoppable but in this game as ichiban you learn what its like to be one of the weaker characters in yakuzas lore to me ichiban is your average likable and relatable silent jrpg protagonist such as a persona protagonist but he has an actual inlore personality and one that absolutely dominates every time hes on screen 

also one thing to note bthis is probably the hardest yakuza game in the mainline seriesb ive only died 3 times so far in this game but thats 3 more times than my entire playthrough of 06 i also played on hard in those games this game doesnt have a difficulty option but when this game wants to fuck you up itll fuck you up especially with boss battles ch 11 onwards

ultimately i think rgg studios did an excellent job with this game and i dont have much wrong with the game other than a few combat nitpicks that being said ichiban and the combat system that comes with him are a fine change of pace and for what its worth i think this a great start to a new saga in the series 

if youre a fan of yakuza youll probably like this game even if youre hesitant on some of the big changes if youre someone looking to get into it and want to play the latest release now is the time to jump into the series if not yakuza 0 is also on pc and usually goes on sale for 5 its up to you

just gotta wait for them to port the remastered collection and y6 to pc at this point yeah


edit 11292020  changed some of the wording prior to be clearer than before while also adding this final section 

i almost forgot to mention how phenomenal the dub for this game is they really knocked it out of the park in my opinion many people are naturally prone to avoiding dubs for their own personal reasons but i think they did an excellent job with the dub to the point where i almost wish theyd go back and redub older games the dub casts fantastically for returning figures and new characters and the vas are really high quality especially ichiban they picked a perfect voice and voice actor for him the dub is just an option it isnt forced on you so if you prefer japanese dubs of course you can use it and like every yakuza game prior the voice acting on the jp side is phenomenal as well 

i didnt play with the dub but after seeing the main story from start to finish i checked some videos for the dub they did a great job so if you prefer to use dubs because subtitles are hard for you to focus on or you just prefer it know youre in good hands with this game 

this may possibly be one of the best games in the series or at least on par with 0 its that good my opinion on the game has really only improved after i let the whole experience sit in my head would definitely recommend to any new or old fan of the series

some tips for you then go play

ichiban falling in battle is an instant game over so make his survivability your number one priority

make sure to interact with each taxi to add it to your list of fast travel locations

gear makes a huge difference especially early on where just buying shoes greatly reduces the damage you take note that you cant enter the second dungeon without ichiban wearing armor on his head body and feet in case you plan on an early spending spree

the job change system is unlocked in chapter 4 after which swapping jobs is done by physically visiting hello work and talking with ririka not the director once available its a good idea to make ichiban a foreman to unlock a convenient map traversal skill

chapter 5 is when youve unlocked most relevant things like job change and the major side activities making it a good time to focus more on side content

bond xp with your party members is eventually locked until you progress their drink links at the survive bar something worth doing whenever you hit a lock

every job has at least two character skills which have a red icon even before theyre unlocked once unlocked the character can use that skill with any job

most area attacks like pyro breath work best when set as a shortcut and used right at the start of an encounter when enemies tend to be close together afterwards hitting multiple enemies relies mostly on things like them lining up for adachis reckless charge targeting whoevers the furthest back

special combo meals in restaurants can give perks the easiest method to find them out is ordering one of everything in the given restaurant

even if you dont care for the management minigame be sure to play it through the first milestone to unlock the 5th party member

in the managment minigame tome kamataki the unfireable grandma can run a fully upgraded ichiban confections by herself around level 20

dont sleep on the minigames some of them provide some really good early game gear the golf minigames are repeatable and the rewards are quite good the illegal boots are very strong early game armor

likewise you can get some great equipment early on at the batting center using the serenity bat will help even though you get less points

can quest has some itemsmaterials that are hard to find elsewhere keep some points handy

later on once you get some money in your pocket you can savescum the casino and gambling hall

enjoy

this new dragon quest game is kinda weird and features a lot of angry japanese men

you play as a 40 year old homeless dragon quest fan with undiagnosed schizophrenia

other jrpgs have teenagers with tragic background saving the world with the power of friendship and here we have a 40 year old neet finding out friendship and becomes a local hero

cdpr moved back the release of cyberpunk 2077 so they wouldnt have to compete with this masterpiece prove me wrong

my new homeless friend was trying to tell me how he has a sixth sense for finding toilets in a city when all of a sudden a mexican wrestler interrupts him and attacks me i had to bring out the big guns and launch an orbital strike which failed to knock him out only after hitting him with vibrator did he go down and i could finish listening to my friends story

yakuza like a dragon has it all

i wanna keep it short even when i could talk about this game for hours now
i honestly cant remember when a game fascinated me in so many ways in the past few years
its been a long time ive had this much fun with a game

there is a good reason the user reviews for this game are overwhelmingly positive you rarely see this for a huge production like that
i thought after yakuza 0 it couldnt get any better but after playing the latest entry in the franchise now i feel like i got proven wrong


you should consider that the game is quite different to the previous yakuza games at least in terms of gameplay since it now uses a turnbased combat system with little additions like quick time events for special attacks always the same buttons so you know which one to press its just to boost your attack and a perfect guard system when pressing a button while being attacked to reduce damage

while i never really played a jrpg before it was quite easy to learn and really fun to play from the beginning on
there was a bit of grinding at the end since its recommended to have a certain level in later chapters the game will occasionally warn you about this too but out of my 85 hours of playtime this only took up like 510 hours i would say and with the turnbased system it was actually fun too

storywise people recommend to play at least yakuza 0 before since its a prequel of the whole yakuza series and some characters might show up in this game too and after playing the game before i definetly agree that it is useful to do so the game has a very high focus on narrative as usual for yakuza games however it is not necessary to have played it since the main characters in this game are different and you can follow the story without any problems
all the new characters in the game are really likeable especially the new main protagonist ichiban kasuga is really funny and charismatic its just super entertaining and refreshing 

with the recent announcement of yakuza remastered collection yakuza 345 and yakuza 6 coming to steam in early 2021 and the other main entrys of the franchise already being available on pc theres never been a better time to get into yakuza especially if your main platform is pc

thanks to ryu ga gotoku and sega for making those amazing games possible

#####

in the 19 hours ive played this game i have

 stopped a man from selling animal fuck videos to horny teens
 told a man to divorce his wife then beat the shit out of diaperwearing yakuza
 reinforced a young girls will to live by protecting a persimmon
 collected numerous cans to exhange for money because im poor
 gained newfound respect for sex workers
 stopped a man from polluting a river with his piss
 strengthened a mans relationship with his son after i beat the shit out of him over a dirty bookshelf

yeah games alright

ichiban is a 40something former yakuza who spent his best years behind bars for a crime he didnt commit  in the face of betrayal and being leftfordead by his former boss ichibans optimism and willingness to start his life over from rock bottom shine through  inspired me a deadbeat 30something to seek employment for the first time in years

#####

like a dragon drew me in and i didnt play anything else until i 100d the whole game

h1bthe goodbh1
yokohama the main new location of the game is a completely new and fresh experience that was long overdue isezaki ijincho district looks nice and is quite atmospheric during the night considering that most of the yakuza games take place in kamurocho and sotenbori at some point you know the district so well that theres nothing that would surprise you as soon as i got the opportunity to explore yokohama the feeling of staleness went away not only the new area has the same density and attention to detail as other districts but its also larger

substories are now partially voiced meaning that introduction ending and sometimes even middle scenes have full voice acting it might not seem like a big thing but the voiced lines not only help with the immersion but also keep the players attention in check leaving a longerlasting impact majority of yakuza titles at least the ones currently available on pc dont have much voice acting for substories so this extra flair is welcome 

this game is yet another completionists heavenhell new minigames item gathering npc rescuing enemy hunting business management and much more have completion but there are good news for those that dont want to spend most of their time on these theres no need to 100 every single category to get all the games achievements most of said achievements dont require extensive grind

the newly introduced minigames arent tedious and are a good change of pace from the fightingstory it aint more gambling games i promise not only theres more variety to them but even previous minigames like golf got slight tweaks on top of all of that any activity that includes a party member will increase your bond with them so now theres actual benefits from playing minigames with or against other characters

theres a surprising amount of cutscenes the prologue chapters alone can take around 6 hours and theyre packed with cinematics personally i enjoyed the slightly overdone story exposition as it was a good way to learn about the new characters however this goes both ways as this can be tiring for some people it should be noted that once you get into meat and potatoes of the story the amount of cutscenes lowers and all of them are skippable anyway not that i would recommend skipping them during the initial play through 

h1bthe nitpicksbh1
during the battles your team relies on automatic path finding to get over to the selected enemy countless amounts of times ive had characters run into a wall or a static object just to get stuck and keep running against it for solid 6 seconds before giving up and straight up teleporting over to the enemy there were times when characters would get stuck against dynamic objects such as cars which resulted in the car just disintegrating into thin air considering that this is the main shtick of the game the complexity of pathfinding is subpar and the handling of stuck characters is appalling

either due to an oversight or an intentional decision this game has cut down minigame music declaring riichi in mahjong no music playing infinite home run mode in baseball the same music loop plays throughout without changing at all playing cards all ambient music is missing i honestly dont understand the reason for this downgrade but the background music played an important role of setting in the mood and making the player feel cozy i mean the music still plays in these establishments its just that as soon as you start the minigame it gets muted

not including one of the party members into any of the story cutscenes or events is disheartening everyone gets their screen time but one particular character is never included not even in a supporting role placing them right next to the main cast and having them silent would be enough and a simple toggle for those players that dont have that character in the party would solve any scene consistency issues but i suppose that would be too much effort eh

unnecessary grind is how id describe most of the minigame completion requirements it would be understandable if the final milestones were a bit above the amount that is needed to complete all stages of the minigame but thats not the case the milestones go way above sometimes more than double of what youd have by the time the minigame is exhausted you do end up having more points which can be exchanged for goodies but redoing the same highest difficulty stage over and over just to get those numbers are gets boring pretty quick

karaoke minigame is actually not in sync with the music and it doesnt feel good to play if you listen to the music and press buttons by the beat then you wont get good results which really takes the fun out of it this issue persists across multiple platforms its not even a pc issue

default battle theme of isezaki ijincho district gets boring rather quickly there couldve been a system in place that would change the battle theme based on your current job instead the player gets to listen to the same theme for 90 of the gameplay its such a waste considering how good some story dungeon battle themes are you do get to hear them again but theyre severely underutilized

a similar complaint is for this games jukebox system its possible to listen to the jukebox in one particular safe house and there are no playlists as soon as a bonding dialogue is triggered the music stops its not possible to listen to this music outside or during minigames then whats the point it would be perfect background music for busywork even metal gear survive had a better thought out system truly a wasted opportunity

every video game needs a sewer level and this game has a bit too many of those at one point you start thinking when will this finally end and thats not exactly a good impression i understand that its a simple and easy to make environment for a dungeon but with so little effort those samelooking areas are probably the worst part about the game it doesnt help that these locations are also the primary grinding spot

h1bpc specificsbh1
for the first time ever the release of a dragon engine yakuza game is actually handled by the internal development team yakuza kiwami 2 was ported by qloc and it ended up being quite messy in terms of performance not to mention there were game breaking bugs and some graphical issues are still not addressed

ryu ga gotoku studios efforts on the other hand made it so like a dragon runs overall better but there are a bunch of dumb steamworks oversights like missing arcade minigame files spoilery achievements arent hidden and technical issues like a patch that bricks your game as soon as you have all achievements

the port itself seems decent the stability throughout my 160 hours was excellent the performance was adequate all this needs is more patches that would address common complaints and technical mishaps i mean as of writing this review i cant even boot the game because i have that sweet 100 achievement completion

arcade games literally dont work because some steam depots dont include them so people have incomplete downloads a lot of story dialogues have timing issues especially with the english dub the ends of the sentences often get cut off something that ive never seen in any other yakuza game

h1bconclusionbh1
i may have tons of nitpicks but thats because ive spent too many hours in 0 kiwami and kiwami 2 theres no such thing as a perfect game but if this game had these oversights addressed then id say it practically couldve been one engaging story simple combat over the top essence moves completely new district and a fun party make this game as good as yakuza 0

this game is so cool i wish japanese people were real

everyone deserve a friend like ichiban in their life

the way i got into the yakuza series is probably the same reason many others have gotten into it 
i saw the trailer to yakuza like a dragon and i didnt even know what yakuza was but i thought damn this game looks good cant wait to try it out might be amazing simple as that right hahahaha yeah no queue hundreds of people telling me to start with yakuza 0 first and play them in order you wont regret it like really does it really look like i have the time to go through 7 mainline yakuza games to play like a dragon i wont listen to them thats stupid i said ill just play like a dragon but the wait for the game got longer and i decided to try at least 0 first 
damn 0 was a really good game better try kiwami and kiwami 2 after i finished those i decided that ill finish yakuza 0 to 6 before i played like a dragon
was the grind and the wait worth it yes do i regret not starting like a dragon first not at all like a dragon is literally made ten times better if you have all the knowledge of prior games
how does like a dragon fare as a yakuza game its probably one of my favorite of the mainline games
yakuza is a really weird series but ill be damned if it isnt worth spending every single minute in it
the music and the combat go so well together the story is so good youll most likely cry at least when the plot isnt doing something stupid then youll just be laughing your ass off while crying
yakuza like a dragon is also the first yakuza game i have 100d well idk i was just so hyped for it and i had to get to it but i was in no rush to get to it but the hype i had when i finally started it was still there and it delivered hard
if you want to try out yakuza like a dragon as your entry into the series i wont judge you but if you have the time try and go through 0 and 6 first it will make this game that much better you dont even wanna hear the sounds i was making when a character you know just appears in the scene with a cool new variation of his theme and then you get the dynamic intro to a boss fight i was in a constant state of yoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo 
and then i just had to listen to that song on repeat for the next few hours and following days 




#####

i fought an excavator with a dildo

damn what a fantastic game i have known about the yakuza franchise for a while but never game them a try that is until now yakuza like a dragon is a standalone entry so previous knowledge of the other yakuza games is not necessary however characters from previous entries do make an appearance this is one of the best times to jump in to this franchise  especially if youre a newbie like me

the big change here is the turnbased combat with some activetimed button presses for guarding or bonus damage overall the combat system is good but not perfect

ubprosbu
list
the animations variety and creativity of all the attacks is wonderful  
poundmate system  summons that require money
a job system similar to that of the older ff titles and even some skills that carry across jobs
some great bosses and the enemy design is hilarious
all the battle music will make you dance and really get into it
perfect guards are satisfying to pull off
list
ubconsbu
list
the ai has pathing issues at times where they will get stuck on the environment these can even cause attacks to miss as the characters attack will not make physical contact with the enemy 
too easy at times
some real health sponge bosses that are not even difficult  they just take forever to die
list

it was great going through all the story beats side dungeons and substories but the encounters on the street in the city can be draining they are never challenging and just serve to get in the way of somewhere youre trying to go prolonging what you were trying to do this brings me to a minor rant of rpgs usually jrpgs these days having random encounters because it is something they all have so lets add them in older rpgs random encounters served the purpose of being a threat to the party where each one was difficult and a possible game over  this created tension and a layer of strategy in conserving items mana etc over the years this central idea has faded away  leaving alot of these games with easy and boring random encounters which pad the game out which is the case for like a dragon too here random encounters are never a threat you mindlessly bash the enemies down also there are a million ways to restore your hpmp in the city so resource conservation is only ever a challenge in the dungeons in chapter 12 you can get an item that removes the wandering encounters in the city  and it is a boon i never took this item off once i obtained it 

running around the city is a treat there is so much detail in every building that it really adds to the immersion of having a living city especially at night time turn on the first person camera and just take it in as you walk around zooming in all the posters and signs can distract you for hours in addition to all that detail the city is covered in loads of minigames ranging from golf to baseball to competing against other homeless people to collect cans i definitely got sucked into a few of these for a long time while i completely forgot about advancing the story

the story its lovely its hard to talk about too much without giving away some serious spoilers but the story and characters are the best part of this game lots of intriguing mysteries that keep the player guessing there is a bond mechanic with your party members similar to that of persona where they each have their own story you can advance all the characters have some wonderful depth and the main character ichiban is such a wonderful wellmeaning doofus you can not help but smile along during some of his speeches i was a bit sad once those credits started rolling more ichiban

so ya like a dragon is a wonderful experience and almost a perfect game for me

#####

for anyone new to the series such as myself  you should be aware that this game is all about the storyand i mean that in a good way the story is absolutely great 

however you have to be ready for a lot of cut scenes and dialogue as an example you have to watch almost 4 hours of extended cut scenes before the game part of yakuza like a dragon even begins it is the best storytelling ive ever seen in a game but it amounts to watching two entire movies back to back before you even get into any meaningful or challenging fights  another example of the emphasis on story in most games a simple quest is fairly basic and straightforward in this game a simple quest can involve 3040 minutes of conversations and interactionsbut it is done so well that you want to be there for all of it

 if you are not scared off by these warnings yet dive in and you will be rewarded with something really special you get to know these characters and their relationships so intimately the conversations and interactions are very real and human im less than 8 hours into this and i can already tell that it is going to be epic beyond epic

combat is not too challenging although the occasional boss fight or highlevel npc encounter can require some real tactics i like the way they allow you to augment your turnbased special attacks with semiquicktime actions to boost their effect combat is fun and violent and there are lots of skills for your characters to use everything is about that powertrip in this game and im already mowing through most encounters with little real effort that doesnt bother me at all since the story is what carries everything forward in this game

world building in yakusalad is absolutely top notch so many interesting locations and characters and situations ive been playing computer games extensively for 20 years or more and ive never found any world or story as fully developed as in this game they tell a huge and complex and emotionally resonant story while leading you through a detailed world packed with cool relatable criminals and outsiders

however this is not a conventional game where the focus is on game play for some people that will be a major turnoff and they rightfully should stay away but if you are looking to explore a cool culture via a magnificent story filled to the brim with memorable and likable characters this game is for you


#####

honestly one of the best games ive ever played a hidden gem that didnt get enough attention 

it is at times dramatic heartwarming uplifting humorous and completely absurd and it all works 

yakuza like a dragon also touches on some serious social issues in a way thats organic to the game and setting without beating you over a the head with it a recurring theme is the gray areas of society and the law and how and why people end up there 

the protagonist ichiban i find a refreshing change to quiet surly dudes or someone trying to be a badass hes earnest and genuinely wants to help in a way that makes running around and helping a bunch of random people with their problems make more sense than in most games hes also over 40 happily runs around with a botched perm and is an unapologetic gamer nerd 

likewise some of the companions are quiet different than what you would find in most games with one being homeless and another over 60 

the turn based combat works surprisingly well in this modern setting and through the protagonists imagination all sorts of elaborate and entertaining wacky battle techniques are able to be used 

listening to various party conversation while running around town or eating at a wide variety of restaurants was another unexpected highlight for me 

there are a lot of minigames but mercifully for me since i am terrible at most of them they are optional and theres even a way to get some of the high end items from those minigames at a large premium at a store late in the game 

if i had one quibble it would probably be that one of the party members was not involved in the story at all and felt tacked on even though i used this person in my party a lot but other than that this game is ahem number 1 with me 

i didnt really know anything about this game or the series and went into it on whim but im very glad i did

#####

i am not the same man i was 7 yakuza games ago

if i were to list the only japanese openworld game that can rival the gta series i would choose the yakuza series without hesitation as a wellknown game series under sega the performance of the yakuza series in recent years will not disappoint this time yakuza like a dragon or yakuza 7 changed the protagonist of the game and made great changes to the similar fighting method and system in the past

the plot of the yakuza series has always been its most exciting selling point under the seemingly simple storyline and character settings there are often deep and touching dark lines hidden in the plot in terms of the progress of the game plot the production team also controlled it very well the humorous and joyful serious and sad atmospheres can be changed flexibly giving players a smooth and comfortable game experience the overall game story experience is like watching a wonderful japanese tv series combined with the games fine depiction of the main characters movements facial expressions and details players often wonder if they are watching a liveaction tv series

in other aspects of the game such as side quests scene design various minigames and many other elements the players game experience is more diverse and players can freely decide how they want to play to a large extent the games music sound effects and voice actors performances are also very good it can be said that this game can bring players an audiovisual feast

despite this the transition from hardcore fighting to jrpgstyle character combat has always been a point of contention among players and many players have mixed reviews for it although the innovative jrpg gameplay of this game can indeed bring players a different experience at the beginning and may bring a certain degree of freshness to old players in the early and middle stages as the game progresses the drawbacks of this change become more and more apparent the combat system of the game itself is not designed very well moreover the level and damage values of enemies and bosses in the later stage of the plot are too abnormal which makes it more necessary to carry out other challenges and minigames to improve the level of the characters which is very unfriendly to some players who focus on the story and like to play the main and side stories separately at the same time the price of this game is higher than that of the previous series although its quality will not disappoint most players

all in all yakuza like a dragon is still a jrpg openworld game worth playing its plot graphics and game experience are basically at the highest level in the industry of similar games but players need to carefully consider whether they can tolerate the shortcomings of the combat system and the need to invest too much time and cost to complete the game



#####

this game was such a relief to me i mean its been so long since ive been able to find a jrpg that has grabbed my attention and kept me interested from start to finish that i had started to think it wasnt possible anymore ive tried ipersonai and idragon questi and itrailsi and hell even classic ifinal fantasyi games that i busedb to love but none of them spoke to me thats part of why i slept on this one for so long but now that ive played it i can say that iyakuza like a dragoni was exactly the game i needed to remember why i loved jrpgs in the first place the first time kasuga saw the party and the enemies change into jobappropriate costumes at the start of battle i was hooked i had to see all of the goofy enemies and ridiculous costumes and hilarious attacks for the first time in byearsb i was playing a jrpg that i couldnt put down and it felt fantastic

so i havent played any of the games that come before this one in the series but i understand that this is a huge change in direction you cant tell from playing this one though this game seems like a masterpiece that could only come from a culmination of experience after years of making jrpgs seriously they struck gold on their first try here 

despite the silly characters and preposterous premise the story had me by the shortandcurlies throughout the entire game the more the stakes escalated the more i needed to see what happened next watching kasuga as he goes from nearly dying in a pile of garbage to spoilercampaigning to become an elected officialspoiler may not seem like it would be all that thrilling but it had me glued to my screen this is an excellent example of the heros journey set in modern times with almost no magic or monsters to help or hinder along the way it constantly steps to the edge of becoming fantasy without ever going over it was fun to see how the developers balanced the main characters overactive imagination with the reality of the world around him honestly i could go on about the story and the writing for hours but ill stop there ill just say that this game is worth playing for the story alone

but whats a story without gameplay well thats a visual novel i guess luckily the gameplay is just as engaging combat has light qtes that boost damage dealt or reduce damage taken making battles far more entertaining minigames are freaking everywhere and run the gamut from a business management sim to racing gokarts and combing the city streets for treasure and helpful npcs was an absolute blast throughout the whole game trying out different jobs and levelling them is rewarded with permanent stat boosts and skills that carry over to other jobs side quests tend to be just as well written and interesting as the main story getting hit by cars after not looking both ways before crossing the street was never not hilarious honestly i forgot that jrpgs could be bfunb until i played this game and had a fucking blast the whole time

okay not the bwholeb time there are few issues here and there like the number of actual dungeons is shockingly small and when the player does find themselves in one they tend to be pretty dull in terms of design there was a huge difficulty spike at about twothirds of the way through the game that almost made me rage quit some of the jobs just kind of suck and im not sure why they were put in the game you know little crap that makes no difference in the long run

because in the long run im going to look back on this game and remember what a great time i had playing it as unlikely as it seemed to me before i started playing it this game has made it onto my personal list of the best games of all time you absolutely must play it if youre a fan of jrpgs or rpgs or the iyakuzai franchise or just sega in general hell even if none of those things describes you id recommend giving it a chance though it might seem unlikely you might just find something to love about this game

#####

ive been collecting cans for days so im not sure how the game ends but definitely the best homeless simulator ive played

#####

kinda like yakuza but like a dragon

#####

best persona game to date

#####

imagine the kinda guy that looks at the other yakuza characters and going hes just like me fr except hes a complete and utter moron you get to play as that guy now

#####

i love it when you are walking around and some hungry homeless wants to fight which i respond with an orbital strike on his location

#####

after 7 games of beat em up action ryu ga gotoku studio launched a joke video on april fools day of yakuza doing a turnbased jrpg angle this got so much positive reactions that the devs actually made that joke a reality so how good did the joke land

yakuza like a dragon is such a blast to play it emulates that 0 feeling by having a well structured and engaging story and effectively serves as an origin story to new series mainstay ichiban kasuga a lowly grunt working for the arakawa family in early 2001 he has to take the fall for a kill gone wrong 18 years later he is released from prison to find an unfamiliar world in an unfamiliar setting this introduction is ripe for a beginner to the series to indulge in but certain story events and past characters showing up hit so much harder if you started from 0 and played all the way up until 6 especially the passing of the torch to ichiban is a well done one while kiryu was certainly a great protagonist in his own right it is refreshing seeing a protagonist who really goes all out on his emotions and really you cant help but root for a guy like him his party members are also a joy to have around especially as ichiban relies on his friends much more than kiryu ever did the story is also phenomenal probably the second best behind 0s

but story aside what about the shift to a turnbased jrpg format honestly yakuza contextualised in this format works surprisingly well it doesnt really innovate but more just evokes that old timey jrpg feel it probably helps if youre a fan of dragon quest as they actively mention that ichiban grew up playing them and basically imagines his encounters much like those games would be a very conventional take on an unconventional setting of modern day yokohama japan active button presses for skills and guarding give some agency to keeping interest in fights and being able to skip lengthy skill animations are a good step its rather humorous seeing the tropes and hallmarks of those being done in a watered down down to earth setting well as much as yakuza can get anyways having characters being able to switch jobs helps too but its obvious which jobs are good for which characters most of the times having retainable skills from each job helps in encouraging diversity though its the alien isolation of jrpgs in that for a first attempt at a different genre shift its a damn good first impression a little bit more tweaking and this would have been perfect

while the main method of going through the games may have changed one thing that hasnt the abundance of minigames karaoke is pretty well done with the new cast of characters singing with adachis take on machine gun kiss being a noteworthy one theres a mario kart type minigame a can collecting minigame set against hobos personality tests that actually improve your personality fighting sheep men in a movie theatre to avoid falling asleep and even a capitalist simulator thrown into the mix however if you ever decide to do mahjong they made the ai insanely tough so dont expect an easy time if you liked doing it in the past theres no real incentive to do the completion list or the challenges section this time around as all they give you are personality boosts and youll max them all long before you finish everything on that list anyways

substories are very charming as usual and even have some callbacks to older games a real treat for fans that have been around before this game ichibans take on things helps make these substories stand out you can even raise your bonds with your teammates by having a drink with them unravelling their personal stories and problems not only does this offer backstory on your crew it also helps in combat too so it always helps to be a friend soundtrack is a banger as usual with many new and recurring tracks being used to great effect

i see a lot of potential in the future of the yakuza series as a jrpg series was it weird to do a genre shift in the mainline titles and relegating the beat em up gameplay to the judgment spinoff series yes but after 15 years or so of doing beat em up gameplay i can understand why rgg studios would want to do something new and different ichibans tales clearly work better given that he himself is a dragon quest nut with nagoshi gone and a sequel in the works it will be interesting to see how yakuza progresses in this new world as the endgame song says welcome ichiban i hope youre here to stay

#####

chinese people are weak to electricity in this game

#####

bplaying this showed me what it feels like to have friendsb

the plot of yakuza never disappoints from start to finish it was like watching a crime drama series and you create a bond with the characters by watching them having hilarious partytalks and by witnessing ichiban forming bonds with his fellow party members these bond levellingup cutscenes were a great addition
i was skeptical at first after seeing the gameplay being turnbased now but they have done great job in making skills and summons so over the top that you just cant get tired of seeing them but i do miss the old beatemup style
just like the old games there is so much side stuff to do that you will get lost the amount of substories is less this time and some of the substories are sobstories that made me cry 
i can write so much good things about this game but it should be better if ya all played it instead of reading reviews
a fine addition in the yakuza series

#####

this is everything i ever wanted from a yakuza game zany side stories gangster melodrama and most importantly no tedious beatemup fighting instead you fight using perfectly serviceable and sometimes quite fun turnbased rpg battles

the other thing thats great is that this is a jrpg where the main characters are all 3560 years old and figuring out the second or third act of their lives instead of your usual 17yearoldwithadream nothing wrong with the latter but its nice to play someone my own age in a game once in a while

#####

persona for middleaged man such as myself
gonna play this while i wait for persona 5 royal on pc

a rogue chimpanzee jumped into an excavator and so i had to stop it
punished vergil snake started shooting at it but unfortunately it wasnt very effective thus i had to resort to my orbital strike which did a good amount of damage
the ape unleashed her wrath and crushed my office worker to death thankfully my homeless man managed to bring her back to life with his stanky ass breath
i finished the fight after valiantly slapping the excavator with a stack of money causing it to spontaneously combust however the chimp made it
i promptly hired the chimp to my billion dollar business

#####

never played a yakuza game prior to this the only reason i gave it a shot was cause it was a turn based rpg instead of the beat up style like the earlier games ive been playing turn based rpgs since the original final fantasy so this isnt a new genre to me 

as for the game itself it has to be one of the best if not thee best game ive played in years and i dont say that lightly 

the story is absolutely amazing i couldnt stop playing not just cause it was fun but because i needed to know what happened next the characters were all different and seemed so real with how they were presented theres dozens and dozens of side quests some absolutely hilarious some somewhat weird and some where youre probably gonna need tissues cause theyre pretty heart wrenching hospital girl side quest especially so many different mini games as well with the business owner mini pretty much being its own game in itself

you would think with there being 1 main map that the diversity wouldnt be there but it is and theres a lot to explore so be ready

the battle system was great with lots of different classes skills and weaponsarmour to choose from making most peoples combat style available you want 2 tanks with 2 healers you got it or 4 healers instead go for it cause why not

they really went deep into the grey areas of sex workers and homelessness and i think that in itself was wonderful because its real 

an honest 1010 from me would give more if i could if youre on the fence about this game i hope this helps with your decision

once youre at rock bottom the only way forward is up but the bottom doesnt always have to be all dark and gloomy if you can stand and look up youll see the light of hope up there

#####

schizophrenic persona

#####

ichiban is absolutely one of the best protagonists in video games

#####

who needs therapy when you got kasuga ichiban

#####

dragon quest middleaged man hobos and crime editiontm

#####

its persona 5 but everyones middle aged boomers and you play as eric andre

#####

too late to be noticed but good game

#####

imagine a jrpg but instead of playing as generic anime teenager #295710 you play as a 42 year old schizophrenic eric andre look alike with a rusty baseball bat that fights trash bag men on a regular basis who somehow manages to become the richest business owner in the entire city and be almost completely homeless at the same time and his party consists of another homeless guy but hes a mage specialised in hobo magic an alcoholic driving instructor and a barmaid who beats people to death with a handbag

also the soundtrack fucking slaps and the idea that the entire game is a jrpg because ichiban likes dragon quest and all the overthetop anime ass moves are his imagination and the reason that he literally just stands there doing fuckall and lets his opponents hit him is because its what a hero would do is fucking hilarious 

overall main story is excellent too with great characters and superb voice acting and since its a yakuza game all the side content is on par with the main story with shit like a business management strategy game with board meeting battles a mario kart spin off karaoke table games like mahjong and blackjack and even arcades with tons of old sega games like outrider and virtua fighter

the combat could use a bit of work some of the jobsclasses feel useless compared to others and things like your party and enemies randomly walking around the battlefield is annoying and makes crowd control attacks less consistent although hitting qtes to deal extra damage and block is nice and adds a bit more activeness into the game being able to skip cinematic attacks is also appreciated so you dont have to watch the same cutscene over and over again during combat still pretty good considering is rggs first attempt at a jrpg

overall 9 welldressed bicycle wielding himbos out of 10

real yakuza use a gamepad

#####

h1 essence of the orbital laser h1

#####

greatest business administration sim of all time

#####

i finished this game last night after 114 hours of game time there hasnt been a game in a long time filled with so much mixed emotions ups and downs 

i dont usually write steam reviews but i have to say play this game if youve never played a yakuza game or like me never played a turn based game before give this game a go the characters and story will pull you into a deep powerful story that the game play wont matter that much 

ichiban is such a lovable charismatic character that he completely changes the game from start to finish

#####

ok nanba i need you to trust me we will beat this giant robot with the power of friendship and with this pistol i found in the garbage


#####

needs a sale

#####

the world would be a better place if everyone was a little like kasuga ichiban

#####

this isnt the same like yakuza 0 or kiwami 12 this is a 4 player turned base rpg as someone who absolutely hates turned based rpgs this game was so much fun 

ive already played the game on ps4 story is fantastic characters are very well written and the world is a ton of fun to explore its what youve come to expect from the other yakuza games on pc

and like the other yakuza games on pc the port is very well done no fps lock widescreen support fov sliders it could make totalbiscuit blush 

this is also the first yakuza to have a full english voice cast if youve never played a yakuza game and are turned off by the other games only japanese audio this will be a good way to ease into the world 

if youre a yakuza fan i highly recommend this game 
if youre a turn based rpg fan i highly recommend this game
 
if you enjoy having fun get this game

#####

best persona game on pc

#####

im going to be honest as someone who played through every pc release in the series i thought this game wouldnt be as good as the others due to the combat and the change of protagonists

but now that i have completed this game i can say with 100 confidence that this game is worth playing through every aspect that makes a good yakuza game is still there such as the story funny characters great substories emotional music and fun timeconsuming mini games

for new players who want to get into the series while you can start with this one you will not understand some references and the significance of some late game characters who will just appear out of nowhere late in the game
for series veterans who have been wanting to play this game but are unsure of the games combat please give this game a go i ended up enjoying this games combat system a lot

the pc port is something i dont think i can comment on because i played it on an i5 9600k rtx 2060s and 16gb ram with this hardware configuration i played this game on max settings just fine at 1080p 60 fps so i cant say anything about the port for people that have lower hardware

in conclusion i think the ryu ga gotoku studio did a great job with this game making sure theres something in this game for everyone allowing new fans to enter the franchise and potentially buy other games in this series while the current fans have a great experience as well solid 910

ps for new fans who want to buy other titles in the series heres the order ive played through

yakuza 0
yakuza kiwami
yakuza kiwami 2
yakuza 3 remastered
yakuza 4 remastered
yakuza 5 remastered
yakuza 6 the song of life
and finally this game

okay listen this was my first jrpg game and i had a lot of doubts before i bought it i was also a little confused by the turnbased combat as im not a big fan of such games and most of the time i get bored with them quickly
thank goodness i bought this game and tried it out for myself it was an incredible experience that confidently paved the beginning of my love for this genre
   this game has absolutely everything  interesting professions for the characters a good combat system with beautiful special effects awesome voice acting and music this game has a huge number of other minigames and various entertainments that are not much related to the story but all of them are definitely worth a try there was never a chance for me to get bored or not know what to do in this game im ready to list the benefits of this game endlessly but yes you might sometimes feel like youre not playing the game but rather watching a very long movie beating everyone around you during the breaks  but i found it very relaxing and enjoyed going through it 
   id like to share with you my impressions of the story  ive never gotten this range of emotions from games in general i was both amused interested and sad theres faith loyalty love friendships cheating disappointment betrayal murder selfinterest and much more at some points i wanted to cry and at other points i wanted to rejoice like a child or just laugh at the local humor i was angry at the antagonists and i empathized with the main character as if i really knew that person ive never experienced such twists and such mood swings in a game lol i dont want to spoil anything because its really worth trying for yourself
   i recommend this game to anyone who likes a really deep story thats the main reason why i fell in love with this game in the first place i also recommend it to people who like turnbased games who like jrpgs japan in general and especially the yakuza theme and anyone who looking for a new gaming experience because im sure ichibans story wont leave anyone indifferent
1010 no options

#####

what persona would be if half the cast were over 40 years old

#####

drink the milk trust me on this

#####

story is nice kasuga is a chill protagonist but unfortunately there is spoilerno disco dancing like in yakuza 0spoiler therefore this game is categorically inferior by every metric no point spoilertearing up the streetsspoiler if you cant spoilertear up the dance floorspoiler

#####

there are three important things about this game

1 real yakuza use a gamepad
2 real yakuza chooses japanese language
3 real yakuza does not skip the cutscenes

this is the way

#####

yea he was like a dragon

#####

7 games later and i still refuse to use a controller

#####

ive only had ichiban for a day and a half but if anything happened to him i would kill everyone in this room and then myself

#####

finally a main character in which i can say hes literally me in an idiotic way not delusional

#####

thank you for finally bringing a yakuza game to pc on international launch day sega

#####

bii dont have friends i got familyib  ichiban kasuga

#####

i love this game so far its its own game in many ways as its not like the others in the yakuza series the fight system is turnbased rpg style and its the first one where kiryu isnt the main character that being said there is a lot in the story tied to the rest of the series it starts out in kamurocho and throughout the game you get easter eggs from other yakuza games the story is solid and once you play for a bit you can really start to appreciate everything this game has to offer also note that this is one of the longer yakuza games in terms of playtime even beating out yakuza 4 on a final note this game is made in a way that someone new to the series can get into it but has enough to satisfy those who have played the previous 7 yakuza titles great game overall and well worth the purchase

#####

has the best class in any rpg ever homeless guy

#####

can you tell me how to get to the station

#####

this is easily the best dragon quest game

#####

play as a 40year old exconvict who learns about the magic of friendship d

amazing game 

#####

right where do i start

yakuza like a dragon later in this review yakuza 7 has been my introduction to the yakuza franchise as a whole prior to this all i knew about was the bakamitai meme which i also only knew as the dame da ne song i was a bit sceptical about getting into it at first as i knew absolutely nothing about the game and franchise as a whole and brawlers werent really my thing but then i heard that this game features a different protagonist and instead of a brawler plays as a turn based rpg i had some money left over from christmas and im a big fan of the old final fantasy games so i thought i might as well give it a try could always refund it if i didnt enjoy it 

in yakuza 7 you play as ichiban kasuga a yakuza grunt who goes to jail to cover for a higherranking member of the arakawa family which he belongs to thinking that this would make him climb the yakuza ladder and that his patriarch will honour and appreciate his cover he comes back after 18 years of prison time to find out that everybody had abandoned him former police officer koichi adachi researched about the tojo clan and the arakawa family attempts to convince ichiban to come with him to yokohama to stay safe but ichiban refuses ichiban finds his way back to his former patriarch and is then met with an unfortunate fate

oh boy i was immediately hooked from the start thats a lot of cutscenes for a game its like im watching a movie was my first thought i liked story heavy games but i felt a little overwhelmed on my first day as out of the probably 5 or 6 hours that i was playing 4 of them were just watching cutscenes now this might turn some people down especially if they just want to enjoy the gameplay but all the introductory scenes got me more invested in finding out about the presented characters and i didnt just want to stop playing until i found a point where i thought okay now the actual game finally begins

the vast majority of this game takes plays in the streets of yokohama more specifically isezaki ijincho yokohamas red light district the world is incredibly detailed and youll be pleasantly surprised to know that theres things hidden in every single corner i really enjoy exploring in video games trying to see if theres things hidden in places nobody would think of and to my surprise they really thought of everything here i try sneaking into a corner that i think might not even be intended to go to and yet theres something there for me to pick up 

i personally went for the 50 main story 50 side story approach which to me means  ill do 2 or 3 side quests of which there are plenty in yakuza 7 and then ill do a few story quests so that i can keep up with what is happening and trust me theres a lot of content to burn through all of the sidequests are very well designed and most of them got at least a little bit of a chuckle from me so id like to think that they are quite humorous once done with the sidequests i grabbed my imaginary bucket of popcorn and started getting immersed in the story 

after i arrived in yokohama and the game properly begun for me i thought to myself that this would be a silly little hero adventure one of a redemption arc where ichiban becomes the hero of a big and epic tale well its kinda like that it starts off slow and adventurous but the more the story goes on ichiban falls deeper into this crime drama rabbit hole i will not spoil anything for the sake of letting you enjoy it by yourself but i can say youre in for a treat a big one 

the gameplay itself is as mentioned earlier a turn based rpg i hit you then i wait then you hit me and then you wait yakuza 7 adds a nice little twist to that by adding small simple qtes to most of your abilities sometimes you might have to press a button repeatedly to give it more power sometimes you might need to press the button at the proper time instead sometimes even both its a very very simple thing but it keeps the combat entertaining which is the main purpose all attack animations look nice and polished too some of the names and descriptions are silly and will put a weird look on your face when you first see it but all skills feels nice to use you might not have many skills when you first start the game but the more you progress the more and more skills will be added to your arsenal

this game works in a job system which you might be familiar with if you played some final fantasy games while each character has their own primary main job they can also switch to other jobs which in this game are gender locked male characters can choose from a variety of different jobs and female characters have their own jobs to choose from too some of these jobs exist for both genders although slightly altered such as host for males and hostess for females they essentially do the same thing yet they slightly differ from one another

now apart from the amazing story that this game has to offer and the ability to throw ridiculouslooking skills at your enemies theres also plenty of minigames that you can play in this game of course theres karaoke also with bakamitai mahjong shogi and dragon kart yes like actual kart racing just to name a few each of these felt well thought out and theyre fun to do and you can seriously get invested in them if youre dedicated enough sometimes i booted this game up just to play a little bit of mahjong

but theres probably a few negatives about this game right yes there are but in my personal opinion these are just minor things that probably wont even bother you unless you think really hard about it what i disliked during my playthrough is that theres just so many random encounters i was told by a friend that this is common in the yakuza games and that youll have to just deal with it but god theres just so many happens a lot that you walk down one street and you get hit with 3 or 4 different encounters that really badly want to murder you there is an item in this game that completely removes random encounters but i feel like youll get access to it way too late by the time you have it youre probably able to finish the game for good already another issue that i had in this game is that there was one dungeon that just felt way too long to complete it wasnt even challenging or anything you just entered a new floor and thought this is it only to be hit with a wave of disappointment as you realize this is just another floor with the same enemies as the last one it was a slog to get through it but luckily its only a one time thing

so what can i say to finalize this review i think that yakuza 7 is an amazing game with a well written and properly thought out story that is guaranteed to keep you glued to your screen fun and entertaining combat to keep you playing and a wide variety of different minigames that you grind out or even just relax with if you feel like ichiban and his party makes it feel like youre part of the crew that his achievements and goals are yours too and that you too can overcome any obstacle if you just believe in yourself and dont give up ichiban kasuga has been one of the most relateable characters i have ever met and hes found a place in my heart that i will protect this game has also made me buy all the other main yakuza games and im motivated to play through all of them at the time of this review i am currently on yakuza 4 remastered as i found out while playing there are plenty of references to the older yakuza games that will make you go oooh i know this when you see them and they still dont feel out of place when youre new to it i am very happy that this game introduced me to the series and i have no shame admitting that i cried when it was over

baka mitai is also in this game

h1 a slow start that nearly made me miss out on an absolute gem h1

i bought this game on a whim wanting to scratch a jrpg itch i have been having for a while after watching a few reviews online i decided to take the plunge and buy like a dragon to begin with i was frustrated and found myself watching what felt like hours of cutscenes instead of actually playing the game this frustration stems from only having a few hours after work and weekends to get my gaming done i like a rich story in my games but the beginning hours of this game felt closer to a slightly interactive japanese miniseries than an actual game but seeing as though it was the weekend when i got the game i pressed on with my newly discovered miniseries

once the game began to open up and give over more control to me it started to become more and more clear that what was on offer here was something special the amount of care and deliberation that has gone into creating this world story and characters is not something that can be rushed through it takes its time to develop and the longer you spend with kasuga and his delightful little crew the more things start to make sense it has been a while since i have been able to invest in a story and its characters and i can safely say that after 35 hours i have become hooked

the story is rich and deep there is a mystery to uncover in the main quest and tonnes of fun side quests and activities to engage in the game is both serious and absolutely goofy at times the mix between the two is spot on there are some laugh out loud moments and crazy enemies to defeat the city you play in is filled to the brim with interesting and quirky people the city actually feels alive and real unlike some other recent releases looking at you cyberpunk the classic jrpg battle system is at play here a great addition is the movement of the characters on screen while the battles are taking place it give the fights a sense of realism that can be lacking in the old school final fantasy games for example you have the choice to change the classes of your party and find a mix of abilities that work for you so far the balance has been great and i havent felt like i am forced into an op class because the others are just not viable you can just do what you want and play your own way which in a climate of metas and build guides i found to be very refreshing

overall if you are able to sink in the hours and enjoy a fresh take on the tried and true jrpg formula you will not be disappointed by this game yakuza like a dragon is not a game that should be rushed through instead it should approached with a gentle curiosity and allowed to open itself up to you as progress through an interesting and enthralling tale

#####

once youre at rock bottom the only way forward is up but the bottom doesnt have to be all dark and gloomy if you can stand and look up youll see the light of hope there

its been about 2 years since this game first came out yet i still cant put into words just how much i love this game when ichiban was revealed i was confused about the future of the series moreso when they revealed the genre change all this new shit concerning

but getting the game in my hands and playing through it i grew to love ichiban so much in fact he flew from uneasy acceptance to my favourite character in the series hell every character was great they all bounced off of each other so well and all of the casual interactions made it feel like just some dudes and gals hitting the town the gameplay that i was confused on them changing to was fun to play and i never felt like it got old though there are a few things that i hope they improve on in future the story voice acting both sub and dub and themes of the game actually got emotions outta me to the point where the finale still gets me to this day

all of this combined had turned a game i had some disinterest in into one of my top 3 games rgg has ever made it kept surprising me then surprised me more when i wasnt ready please play this game even if jrpgs are not your thing i still urge you strongly to though it may not have the series staple combat its still packed with so much charm its almost blinding

kasuga ichiban please be my friend

#####

we should strive to always go go go go your way believe yourself

#####

i assumed yakuza like a dragon to be a gta clone i was so wrong

this isnt just a game its an intricately woven narrative with captivating characters delivered through vibrant gameplay elements no prior yakuza experience is needed yet the game manages to be both a compelling entry point for newcomers and a sprinkle of nostalgia for veterans

ichiban is a fresh face who wears his heart on his sleeve and an equally flamboyant leisure suit hes easy to root for and his journey resonated deeply with me for yakuza veterans i imagine this is akin to experiencing kiryus story anew 

the world feels vibrant and alive meticulously crafted with realworld japanese locations as inspiration sure its not as sprawling as red dead redemption 2 or grand theft auto but its authenticity is unmatched ditch the cars because this is no driving and embrace the footwork because every corner brims with potential uncover hidden side quests conquer classic sega arcade games or simply soak in the atmosphere

im not into turnbased games yet the turn based combat surprised me with its depth and dynamism its a strategic dance infused with the series signature overthetop humour and spectacle youll be chuckling as you unleash a barrage of batwielding fury or summon a disco ball to blind your foes

whether youre a franchise newcomer or a seasoned yakuza aficionado this game is pure joy cameos from beloved characters sprinkle nostalgia for veterans while ichibans story stands tall on its own for newcomers yakuza like a dragon is an experience worth your money and time







#####

at first i thought that turnbased would suck for yakuza series 

but

significantly better than honkai star rail

#####

i was gonna knock this game for only giving you normal mode at the start since every other yakuza game gives you access to hard mode right off the bat but then chapter 12 sat me down and gave me a comprehensive pointbypoint presentation explaining why im a little bitch 1010

#####

this game changed my perspective on life and introduced me to an incredible series

from the jump i couldnt stop playing ichiban kasuga hooked me because i could relate on so may levels i just lost my job and i had to move back in with my dad after living on my own for 8 years next thing i know i see a dunkey video on the game so i bought it on a whim and for 100 hours im straight up taught how no matter how old a person is no matter how hard rock bottom is you can always restart and keep going that and you should always keep your light

now does the game have some issues sure across the board the gameplay is a solid jrpg effort that doubles as a clear first effort so it can be a little too easy or wonky minus the true final millenium tower the grind isnt bad until attempting the last dungeon but by then youre 50100 hours in so your goals unless intent on all achievements are only the success of the tower and minigame completion the story can also be an issue for some as it begins great then slows way down before picking up again it can definitely be a slow burn
the strangest yet most understood decision was by the end of chapter 12 certain things kind of just happen or go unanswered the intentions with the story were to drive toward the release of like a dragon gaiden the man who erased his name  like a dragon 8 so rgg also deserve applause for the sheer scope of the story they wanted to tell in this new era still this can deter people if you like japanese cinema or malazan you wont stress it

the silver lining like a dragon is a remarkable experience that helps you keep pushing forwards its all about the experience and the characters everyone is given a great amount of care and detail and you really understand them as individuals theyre all facing their own monsters the game is also hilarious youll go from being in your feels to explaining to your cousin that a grown band of yakuza are dressed as babies telling you that baby formula is the nectar of the gods while teaching a young man about the dynamics of parenting im not making this up

so buy it and enjoy the ride you wont regret it

one of the best persona games

#####

i woke up at 5am to download the gamewith 1 week to my finals my experience as a yakuza now will only allow me to intimidate my examiners later so its okay to be playingright

#####

this is a jrpg where your core party consists of three middleaged homeless men who roam the streets of yokohama beating up hobos and drunkards for lemme check the relevant conversions here ah yes about 350 a battle

its peak game design really

#####

ichiban best boy

buy it so we can get 36 judgement and fotns on pc

real yakuza use keyboards and are schizophrenic

#####

nothing like 100 hour turn base jrpg

#####

dragon quest  japanese gangsters  an amazing game

#####

after completing the games story in full and getting over 50 achievements im writing this review to say that this is one of the best if not the best yakuza installment and rgg studio game the game comes with very few flaws and so much enjoyment

a lot of fans in the community were quick to hate on this game because of the turnbased style which was very different from the usual beat em up style personally this doesnt take away from the experience for me rather than 1v1 battles you get to experience fighting with a team which is a refreshing experience from having an ai fight with you the jobs you can assign each character are wacky awesome useful and everything in between the moves that you learn can carry over between each job so you can really add variety and maximize your fighting experience 

i wont speak much for the other perks such as minigames and side quests i feel like the story should really be the highlight of this review i added in the battle note because i know for some fans that can be a huge letdown but it absolutely shouldnt be anyway

the story is one of the best in the series by far ive played every yakuza game save for the spinoff judgement and lost judgement and this has by far the best main character side characters and villains i love kiryu as a character but whereas hes badass and seemingly indestructible were shown that ichiban is not ichiban is a flawed naive character but hes also goofy optimistic loyal and full of spirit the bond he shares with his friends is real and he sees only the good in people even when they do not deserve it the plot is pretty political and at times i felt like there was a culture difference that made me lose certain points but its different unlike y06 its not the same oh the tojo clan is causing trouble again better go fight the chairmain or captain and reinstate daigo as ruler even though someone will just overthrow him later this story actually delves into more than just the yakuza and the focus is only half on yakuza as a whole there are other organizations and problems that ichiban has to face for instance homelessness while some of the problems might seem pretty meager in comparison to the big bad boogieman that is organized crime its nice to see us get down on a personal level and faced against actual societal and real life problems i think y0 was a masterpiece and y1 and y2 were fantastic every game after that was just loosely the same plot with a different villain that had slightly different ambitions this might be a hot take but as a longtime fan of the games i think ylad is taking the series in a much needed direction im excited to see what future games will be like with this change

also fck kume that rat can burn

h1this review is free of story spoilers h1 
 
im not one to make super long reviews but i think this really deserves one this game was target of a big hate back when it was announced making people doubt a lot if it would be good so i think it would be nice to spread a good word about it i hope i can bring you some light if youre in doubt about this game whether if youre new to the yakuza series or not  

bsummaryb yakuza like a dragon is a direct sequel to the main series but introduces a whole new story arc with new characters that means you dont need to have played the other games it works perfectly as a standalone and a great entry if you never played any yakuza game before although youll be missing some small details or context of some returning characters but thats about it making this very short and spoilerfree the story and characters development of this game are heartwarming its a full rollercoaster of emotions during the whole journey engaging fun and intriguing story 

bcombat and difficultyb this game had a major twist to the core mechanics of the series changing from action beatem up combat system to a new turnbased rpg system that has generated tons of hate back when it was announced but trust me the new battle system is super fun charismatic fastpaced and full of resources outside of battle we have jobs system gear crafting creating bonds with your friends even personality its a very complete rpg game difficulty has some upsanddowns to be honest youll stumble into some sudden difficultycurve leaps thatll make you stop reload and grind some exp before fighting again you can overcome this with items ingame but sometimes random encounters can get too annoying as they spawn way too frequently sometimes you might face some huge damage sponge minibosses that will take unnecessarily plenty of time to beat but it still super fun and enjoyable in overall  

bplaytime and contentb id say story is around 40 hours or such if you aim for 100 completion youd be easily playing over a hundred hours after you finish the story you can still walk around freely exploring and doing everything you havent yet at your leisure and you unlock extra dungeons with super powerful enemies to keep fighting the map is rich full of details and plenty of interactive stuff to do discover the activities the substories etc yakuza always delivered very vivid scenarios so isezaki iijincho wouldnt be different in fact its the biggest district of the series so far

bsoundtrackb all i can say is yakuza is known for having good soundtrack the music of this game fits so nicely it makes epic fights even more epic really not much to say besides listen and enjoy 

bdlcb of all dlcs the most impactful is the management one as it gives you a huge boost on the minigame the pachislot dlc is free so you can download whenever the job set dlc adds two new jobs that you can apply your characters costume and karaoke sets are just cosmetics karaoke set does not add songs to the actual minigame just the background jukebox at survive bar you can survive well without any dlc theyre just for convenience or for fun

ba downside to considerb theres a downside i should warn you which is performance this game uses the dragon engine its a new engine being used since yakuza 6 on ps4 and its massively heavy keep in mind you might actually need a fairly okay pc to have an enjoyable experience without much stutters or crashes 

this game was surely one of my most waited releases of this year ive played every other yakuza game besides ishin and i was super excited for this one its understandable that turnbased rpgs isnt everyones most favorite style but i totally recommend giving it a shot either if youre a newcomer or a veteran in yakuza series im sure you wont regret 

#####

you are funny japanese man

#####

this game puts the based in turn based rpg

seriously didnt expect it to be my favourite yakuza game going in

#####

its hard for me to review any game because they dont really leave anything remarkable to comment on but yakuza like a dragon made me enjoy singleplayer videogames again


h1 gameplay h1

ive never tried to play any jrpgs besides pokemon on the gameboy color theyre just i not my thing i  im not into farming minmaxing or all the core features they offer you might relate to the fact that gameplay with so many ins and outs can be quite overwhelming and thats ok

byakuza like a dragon b not only has i almost i  all the jrpgs core mechanics but delivers them in a way that even people that never really liked jrpgs make the game enjoyable and leaves you with a motivation to try other games of the genre navigation system is also decent

b minigames b

they will certainly consume a good chunk of your playtime although theres a lot of variety and theyre fun the game also b makes you b max three specific minigames which i may i deter some people of keep playing

list
 its almost impossible to have any money if you dont max out the ichiban group minigame which comes at around 15 hours into the game
  youll also find yourself spending hours in sotenboris arena farming xp and rewards because youll find yourself underleveled against spoiler kiryu majima saejima spoiler
 the school minigame was very original and fun but also suffers from being a must if you want to interact with certain parts of the map
list

b replayability b

you have up to 6 companions plus ichiban and each one has up to 7 jobs for you to choose which makes up to hundreds if not thousands of combinations for ng


h1 story h1

b personally b the main focus of this game was not only who ichiban considered family but also people who joined him along the way and was friends with him theres a strong sense of friendship and empathy between ichiban and his companions 

i couldnt ask for a better protagonist ichiban i feels i like a child trapped in a mans body spoiler him wanting masato arakawa ryo aoki spoiler to do the right thing and forgiving him for all he did is just an example of how i innocent and naive i in a good way he is being faithful to the end to the man who shot you also makes up a point where ichiban is a kind hearted person

you might be dissappointed if the story drifts away from ichiban and arakawa because you end up being an outsider to the ijin three plot but it really pays off and ties all the knots the last 10 hours of the main story spoiler the plottwist where you find out ichiban is really arakawas son was the games climax for me spoiler

former yakuza games characters like the ones above mentioned also feel like a well done fan service and gives away rgg intentions on tying kiryu and ichibans stories together even if theyre different protagonists youll definetly appreciate this if youve played former yakuza games

the ending was bittersweet for me spoiler i really didnt want masato to die and wasnt expecting kume out of all people to stab him but at least it was after he found redemption with ichiban all characters received closure for me and i was satisfied with everyones fate spoiler


h1 final thoughts h1

would i recommend this game yes it has given me the most entretaining 80100h of playtime in years i bought it for 15 but id gladly pay full price for it i want to commend rggsega for not selling these 50100h content games for 60 or 70

the only objectively bad thing about sega is denuvos implementation which i particularly dont like

#####

dont let my hours in the game through steam deceive you i played 167 hours via xbox game pass 

i hadnt played a single yakuza game before jumping into the series with like a dragon largely because i love rpgs id heard of the previous games knew of vague plot points and popular characters but even without the background knowledge that i know would make this game even better i absolutely adored this journey with ichiban and his party whether youve been with this series from the start or youre looking to jump in i cannot recommend this game enough the turn based combat is the usual jrpg style but the setting and wacky flavor adds a special something that unless youre trying to beat the true final millennium tower post maingame refrains from getting stale every side quest was a blast to complete full of memorable characters and unique moments that break up the potential boredom that could come from doing the same core gameplay over and over again while the beginning of the game starts with plenty of cutscenes that leave you itching to jump into actual gameplay once things get going i found the pacing was much better than the first few hours of introduction the story that unfolds is one that is entirely relevant both to japan and those in the west too its an underdog and outcast story through and through and its hard not to sympathize with ichiban and the friends he makes along the way

i could go on and on about this wonderful game but i think this is more than enough of my incoherent rambling thoughts if you like jrpgs or are looking for a meaningful heartwarming story about people at rock bottom finding meaning and  hope look no further than yakuza like a dragon you may find yourself in love with a whole new series of games in the process

#####

by far one of the best yakuza games having played all 8 of them on steam this one truly shines with ichiban being the new face of the franchise i really thought there wouldnt be a story to rival yakuza 0 but here we are cant wait to see what rgg studio does in the future because the series definitely is in the right hands

seriously do yourselves a favor and play it

#####

incredible

 fantastic story from start to finish with exceptional writing
 incredible characters ichiban is awesome
 fun simple yet effective combat system
 open world with tons and tons of things to collect and raise your stats with
 lots of dragon quest series references theres even metal slimes
 jobs many jobs for the turn based combat
 plenty of returning minigames to dive into from the rest of the series
 some big moments for those whove played the rest of the series
 visuals are nice and the game runs great
 music is above par
 as a weebsubjapanesevoiceover loving anime watcher this games english voice cast is unbelievably great for those of you reading this whove also watched some really bad english dubbed anime aka about 95 of it you will not be disappointed by this games english cast they even lip synced the characters

 game is definitely meant for a controller

 mahjong achievements and rng achievements honk honks
 if ichiban dies in combat its game over even in a full party
 game is a bit easy on the normal difficulty with the exception of the bosses throughout the game which take a good amount more of preparation good news is there are other difficulties bad news is you have to beat the game to play on them

i havent invested 150 hours in a single player game in a long time im almost sad the journey is now over what a gem

#####

ichiban gaming

main guy is a middle aged chad boomer that doesnt know how to use a smart phone very likeable same with the rest of the cast  funny humor lots of content  combat system is not too difficult and is easy going for filthy casuals like myself

#####

god tier characters great story typical yakuza minigames that you can collectively sink as many hours into as the main game could not recommend this enough

#####

me dad i want persona

dad we have persona but good at home

persona but good at home

#####

real yakuza use a steam deck

#####

its the urban version of dragon quest with middleaged heroes

you have a tattoo not the best one but it will have to do you had a hairstyle with a fade called the punch perm 15 years later its a tattered mess you are homeless you are past 40 you make friends that are somewhat homeless as well and together you fight like hell to rise to some sort of decency in this mayhem we call life i have been homeless i have had a bad haircut i have had no money and now i live a somewhat decent life with a better haircut serbian barber at the end of the mall here in the neighborhood but without the tattoo this game speaks to me and it might speak to you this game is ultimately about people friendship and goodness and we really need that in times like these

#####

a better buy than cyberpunk

#####

the yakuza guy was so cool they made another one crazy

#####

bold new art direction for the bravely default series

#####

i went to this new journey without any real expectations since i knew it changed its direction to turn based combat with multiple characters involved at all times but besides that i knew little of its entire scope after so many installments with the same ol characters its exceedingly rough to introduce a whole new story with every single minor or major part brand new however ryū ga gotoku studio nailed it once again it is really a new breath of fresh air not looking with any negativity towards previous titles just the diversity is welcome to have to avoid getting any stale dragon engine has been tweaked substantially with technology that allows more detailed expressivity in facial animations besides superior far away rendering shading  antialiasing that previously couldnt hold marvelous landscapes during day time as its always its biggest deficiency the turn based combat mechanics may seem simple at first yet it evolves slowly into complex strategizing the more resilient the oppositions becomes where you simply cant brute force your way out completely story starts out as youd predict surely a happy little family but forever more complex than it looks like with numerous issues arising at every step get prepared for a long rollercoaster of many happenings

completely new minigames which are more comical than ever that fit the new approach of writing and have the diversity of an individuals rich imagination obviously theres also the recurring common ones that existed since the dawn of the series improved  polished for even a better experience the battle themes osts are various with different styles to fit certain locations personalities atmosphere  rhythm theres a new ample reward for exploration besides the usual sub stories called party chats which occur at random locations such as distant landscapes meaningful buildings or inscriptions even memories of characters past and some of my favorites being the trivia which is mostly explained at the time being where its occurring also dont forget to hit the restaurants for very insightful cuisine lore and evidently chitchat one small gripe id have is that theres no upscaling options so enemies could keep up to your level so if you grind more than necessary it can get easier than youre used to previous titles one amazing long journey that rivals the longest entries with so much to do and experience that you wonder if it ever ends prepare for dragon quest


 art style  graphic fidelity
 masterful lifelike animations
 amazing new cast
 party chats everywhere
 new minigame variety
 new ost diversity
 voice acting


 level upscaling

when the game offers you new ways to grind its not a suggestion its a requirement

without any spoilers make sure you are at least
 level 4550 by chapter 12
 level 6065 by the finale
youll have a much better time if you keep this in mind trust me

good game 710

#####

i wanted to like yakuza lad but just couldnt i get why rgg switched to turn based combat but its missing a lot of depth and quality of life features that make turn based combat engaging in other games you never really pause to think in combat because theres basically nothing to think about you get a good team comp going and spam the same moves over and over again because the combat has no depth on top of the combat being a slog enemy encounters are everywhere even more so than in the other games at one point i looked in every direction and there was an enemy encounter waiting for four of them that i could see from a single spot ive cleared an encounter only to have one spawn directly in front of me down the narrow street

as far as the story goes the switch to having a big party is under utilized to say the least whether or not party members show up in cutscenes is entirely random theres no real dynamic between all of them every single sidequest i did just didnt involve the party members at all only ichiban which is an incredible waste even western rpgs like mass effect and dragon age will have your party members chime in during side quests but in yakuza lad they dont matter at all it could literally just be a sidequest in any of the other yakuza games 

there are some other frustrations too once the story starts ramping up they hit you with two significant grinds back to back the first being forced to grind for a significant amount of cash and then after that you get hit with a boss fight that is fifteen levels higher than the enemies in the area leading up to the fight for perspective the game outright warns you against fighting enemies five levels higher than you its needless padding and annihilates the pacing of the story 

not that the main story is great to begin with it wants to be about morally complex situations but it over compensates by expecting you to relate to just the worst possible people there are also some incredibly important cutscenes that get relegated to these weird stills with little to no animation and lip syncing and i  cannot stress how important these cutscenes are cant say more without getting into spoilers

the tone of yakuza lad is also kind of off previous games had wacky stuff but the emphasis was never on wackiness part of what made the silliness so endearing is that it was used in relative moderation lad is wacky more often than not which makes the novelty wear off the first time you see an outrageous enemy design its funny but when almost all of them are that style it all starts blending together

anyway despite being a big fan of the series this entry ended up being one of my least favorite by a wide margin the combat is too lacking in depth to be engaging the expanded cast is remarkably underutilized the grind roadblocks kill the storys already poor pacing and the story itself is nowhere near good enough to make up for the other flaws i think rgg can probably iron out the issues with the turn based combat in future entries but im still not sold on ichiban and company or the tone

#####

can run a successful company in the game while being broke and bankrupt irl 
1010 would nuke random street thugs with an orbital laser to show off my superior entrepreneurial skills

#####

out of all the yazuka games ive played this is one of them

#####

ill be comparing this with yakuza 0 since thats the pinnacle of the series imo

h1storyh1

 1110  i thought it would be hard to beat yakuza 0s story but this game actually did it although there is some nostalgia also involved with returning characters its not overdone and the spotlight is primarily on the main cast 

h1gameplayh1

bcombatb  turn based isnt a problem for those concerned the combat is done really well with button prompts for skills to dish out extra damage and the battlefield is constantly moving so if you quickly attack a downed enemy they take more damage for instance

there are a variety of jobs to switch to like traditional rpgs and the heat moves that are a staple of yakuza games are always a delight to look at if there is one complaint i had its that youll have to level up a job for each party member even if another party member already has leveled that job to say level 20 

this could be a problem in earlymid game and its only towards the late game where you get dungeons with high xp enemies that help you powerlevel at that point i didnt really feel like trying out additional jobs because i had a party combination that could finish any combat with ease its also a bit of a bummer that some jobs have to be unlocked via dlc

there is a slight grind wall towards the end and thats a bit of a downer youll hit that grind wall in a rather unexpected fashion after you get a can of asswhooping but its at most an hour of grinding  which rewards you with end game weapons and armor

bside questsb  standard yakuza fare from the emotional to the downright bizarre expect the same quality as you saw in yakuza 0 however while you got cp points in yakuza 0 for gameplay upgrades here you directly get the reward to help you out in gameplay such as summons in combat and the real estate

bminigamesb  yakuza 0 wins here for the wackiness factor alone thats not to say y7 doesnt have decent ones theyre not particularly memorable activities range from trash collection staying awake in a theater golf baseball and the highlight being dragon kart a take on mario kart you also have the gambling games with western and japanese ones and karaoke is back as well there is a pachinko minigame as well and its just about confusing as youd expect not to mention requiring a separate albeit free download

bbusinessb  while yakuza 0 had two business types to manage here youre stuck with just one thankfully its not grindy and its quite easy to finish however theres a hard limit on how much money you can make that was disappointing for me considering how much harder it is to make money in yakuza 7 take my advice  gamble at the casino on poker and savescum to your hearts delight

h1conclusionh1

yakuza 7 is a rather successful experiment with the transition to turn based combat while its side activities may not be as good as yakuza 0 the qol changes save anywhere and the storyline make this game a must play for any yakuza fan im eager to see where this series will go from here

yakuza like a dragon is a game with a lot of heart and a solid first step for the new dragon of the series you follow the story of kasuga ichiban as he climbs back up from nothing to find answers to decadesold mysteries will you find the answers in this wacky rpg crime drama or are there some things best left buried in the past 

the overall experience is very enjoyable despite a few missteps here and there you do not need to have played the previous titles to enjoy this one however previous events and characters will be referenced and various easter eggs await returning players 


h1storyh1
the story follows the misadventures of kasuga ichiban as he climbs his way from the bottom of life back into society and eventually to the people he left behind like with previous titles the crime drama thriller story is full of intrigue twists and turns as well as a very colorful cast of characters to enthrall the player into following ichi on his quest 

the overall tone of the story is quite in line with past entries in the series dark and suspenseful despite the marketing of the game the road to ichis answers is not easy and he will have to become a stronger man to find and accept them yet despite these travails ichi maintains his positive and energetic self and finds his way upstream the contrast between ichis self and the criminal underworld he finds himself entrenched in is quite intriguing and inspiring 

moreover its touching to see his party be there for him even in his darkest hours and support his endeavors ichi lives true to his goofy manchild self and that is what endears him to the various people he meets yet decades of skeletons to uncover can this koi manage to swim upstream to find the end and ascend to dragonhood

if you are a fan of underdog stories or crime dramas please give the game a chance as the cathartic payoff is quite worth it in the end the story is what i consider the games strongest point and i cannot go into more detail without spoilers

this is the most controversial topic in the game as it shifted away from the series standard 3rd person beat em up action to a turnbased rpg overall the combat is quite fun and retains the visceral and satisfying combat animations from the previous games you use a menu to control your party in combat options include using items attacks and blocking

skills are similar to the mario rpg games in that timed inputs or button mashing are required to bring out the full damage potential of most attacks although there are only 2 input types the sheer variety of attacks and input windows will keep you on your toes as you learn and exploit your enemies weaknesses there is even an option to remove automate the inputs in exchange for a random damage modifier if you prefer a more tactical hands off experience

the job system is quite fun as the yakuza team have reimagined real world jobs as rpg classes for ichi and friends to use in combat want to blowtorch a thug and grate him to death pick the chef class want to do crazy kicks and style on your enemies pick the breaker dancer class want to leave your fate up to chance and attack with gambling gear pick the dealer class  

httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2288908133
the charm of seeing dragon questesque enemies replete with bad pun names and your ragtag party fighting them is very entertaining the sheer spectacle of some skills is also rather amazing combat is also typically quick barring some special high tier enemies
 
healing is also rather easy as just going to a restaurant allows ichi and party to heal up depending on what they order there are even summons in this game all bringing the distinct yakuza flavor with them and a poket index for all the monstrous enemies you encounter   

overall combat serves its purpose and isnt as detrimental to the game as some may make it out to be and is quite fun however there will certainly be points where frustration will set in 

aside from combat there are also a multitude of various minigames to partake in they range from gambling sega arcade games collecting cans not falling asleep at the movies combat gokarting capitalistic conglomeration and much more to uncover 

these all provide a much welcome break from both combat and story and even have neat bonuses and prizes to win not to mention the series signature wacky substories scattered around the world stop a public urinator dial up a man down to pound help a homeless man make a kid smile protect a fruit from the harsh world and so very much more  
  
there is even a sandbox postgame with some exclusive features to explore as well

h1visualsh1
overall the game looks fantastic characters and cities look realistic some vistas are really beautiful however there are some quite lowres lod textures in cutscenes which are distracting at times grass also seems to olny fully render within a set radius around ichi 

the prerendered cutscenes are phenomenal however and the overall cinematography is excellent this is definitely a greatlooking game for a doublea title exploring ijincho actually feels like you are there which is a great accomplishment   


h1audioh1
the sound design is very welldone cities feel lively with bustling vehicles and people sound effects are very good for attacks giving them satisfying feedback and support the story events excellently    

the japanese voice acting is excellent and the game even features an english dub many were wary after yakuza 1s dub but this games dub is very well executed in my limited time with it with experienced voice actors  

the music is overall pretty good there are definitely standout tracks and some that are just meant for background purposes however all help to enhance the distinct yakuza flavor  


h1performanceh1
for me the game worked perfectly out of the box for the main gamestory i had no issue booting loading saving etc that being said some have had significant issues with getting the game to even load thus your mileage will likely vary 

the only thing i noticed was that the game freaks out with high uncapped framerates clothing starts jittering and becomes distracting so i recommend capping it to 60 to mitigate the worst of it likewise the game chugs a bit in certain areas but clears up after a bit postgame definitely has some bugginess as well


h1overallh1
yakuza like a dragon is a game i would recommend to anyone interested in turnbased rpgss or in seeing how the yakuza series continues postkiryu the story is very interesting and the characters are interesting at the least this is likely the biggest draw of the game and rightfully so the rpg gameplay doesnt reinvent the wheel but does add differences to keep things interesting for a long while minigames are fun and varied and offer a nice break from the main game everything else is onpar for a modern doublea title 

although there are some missteps present this is the first game of this type in the series and i eagerly await the next installment

i am a simple man i see yakuza i give a thumbs up

#####

ooh boy where to begin first off let me start by saying when this game came out and i saw that our beloved kiryu would not be the main protagonist i instantly binned it off as one that i wouldnt be playing well after some time im so thankful i stumbled across a lets play on youtube and stopped to watch an episode because from there i was very much intrigued
i had no idea before seeing the lets play that it was turn based and let me tell you i know there are a lot of people out there who absolutely hate that this game is turn based but i for one freaking love it sure ill admit it takes a little away from the feeling you get when playing the other yakuza games but then i generally just button smash in those anyway with this i feel i can better plan out my fights and actually take the time to learn and progress through i think if wed still been playing as kiryu then yes the turn based fighting wouldnt feel right but ichiban is not kiryu and due to his personality and interests he suits this levelling job based system at least in my opinion
speaking of ichiban what a character at first i thought he was just some ridiculously loud daft dude that annoyed me with just how freaking loud he was now however i love him to bits and hes just the sweetest most loyal softest lil yakuza bean out there xd 
yes at times hes still loud and dense but i honestly dont mind it because its just who he is and i can look past it now and see how much his character has come along and helped so many people as hes progressed through his story and i do really like the overall story of this game i havent finished yet but i just know i am going to bawl my eyes out at some point and i also love the different characters that join up with ichiban zhao buddy im looking at you 3 the dynamic between ichi and his friends is fun and i enjoy running around the map with them nattering on at me or taking them out for food or drinks or even to the cinema

ive only sunk around 100 hours into the game so far and ive yet to fight a certain mad dog i know hes coming up i spoiled it for myself and im actually quite happy grinding away to make sure i dont struggle too much in that fight and that in itself is something because this type of grinding usually gets boring pretty quickly for me but so far in this game im having a blast going through and getting new gear and trying to complete all of the side stories and mini games on my way through
i honestly could gush about this game for ages for something that i said i would never play im so bloody glad i picked it up and gave it a chance because everything so far has blown me away with how fun its been from the combat the bondsrelationships the job system the location itself it all feels really well done and of course the japanese voice acting is top notch as usual  plus its rather pretty to look at which is a big plus to me

do i recommend this game heck yes i do 
is the turn based aspect any good for me yes i think it works but that is a huge personal opinion and it definitely will not appeal to everyone as we all know 
is there a decent story to it yes i believe there is
is it worth the money yes admittedly i didnt buy the game off steam as i was having a tight wad moment xd but i do believe its worth it if you have doubts about whether youd enjoy it maybe wait until it goes on sale but at least if you buy it off steam you can refund

dont hold off from this gem of a game do it for ichiban 3

if youre looking for a turnbased rpg give yakuza like a dragon a shot

#####

main story completed probably one of the best stories i have seen in a game with the most likeable and relatable characters despite being the first yakuza series game i have played it serves as an amazing starting point for newcomers with minimal reference to older games going for the 100 now

edit 100 completed 



#####

holy  what a god damn masterpiece of a gamemy first ever yazuka game and the story had me hooked ichiban easily one of the best gaming protagonists ever i rate this 1110 because i managed to catch the guy peeing in the river after 4 attempts

#####

somehow the best game of 2020 got passed up for the likes of last of us 2 and ff7 remake this is very disappointing to me because this game brings a fresh breath of air to gaming its been so long since ive played a game with such a full rich original story that kept me engaged the whole time the story takes a while to start and is very long and may exposition too much at times but its all in good faith to build up for the finale which has some of the best voice acting ive ever heard in my life this is a modern story filled with themes and problems that many people deal with in our world today its dreary with heartbreaking characters however instead of lingering on the depressing tone for hours on end the game is broken up with hilarious moments and side quests this game had me falling out of my chair laughing countless times so dont come into this expecting the same edgy anime tropes you see in every serious story nowadays to cap everything off this game has been one of my favorites that ive played in many years its my first game in the yakuza series and im definitely going to be checking out the rest after this 910

#####

you could have a golden ship a platinum shipa magic flying shipbut those will never ever compete with the greatest ship of all thats right friendship baby talkin bout that op rpg stat of all stats trait of all traits powers of all powers amen praise god 

kasuga ichiban uses the power of his fists to beat people until they are his friends his enemies respect him because he is a simple american man who believes in honor and the american way 

ichiban beats the snot out of people in the kindest most fruitful way without malice or hatred he is someone who doesnt back downbut at his core he is not bitter or trying to prove his worth to anybodyhe doesnt back down because he simply believes in honor and fairness he full heatedly believes in the superpower that is loyalty and once you join his partythats it babyyou are his boy 

theres something earnest affable and downright respectable about this man his positivity doesnt come off as naiviete his persistance doesnt come off as just foolhardy this is a man that believes in the values he believes in

kasuga ichiban is the hero we need today 

play this game

feel the feelings

build your party

become the hero

#####

pros
 good story
 fun minigames
 good mix of humour and seriousness
 decent gameplay
 interesting characters

not pro or con
optimization

cons
 downgraded graphics

overall 9210 second best yakuza game with yakuza 0 being the best

h1introductionh1
byakuza like a dragon yladb gives us a fresh new experience that i honestly enjoyed and the characters are the icing on top one of the neat things about the title is that you can play it without having any knowledge of the previous byakuzab games there are some references to past games however it wont spoil any main events but some from the sixth entry are referenced mostly having played byakuza 0 etcb as baction beatem upsb it is surprising that it was turned into a bturnbased rpgb with that in mind it manages to do it very well while also providing its own unique features to make the game interesting one example is the job rank system about which you can read later in this review

h1pros and consh1
bprosb
list
fantastic crime drama with welldeveloped characters
fun bturnbased rpgb like combat with abilities to utilize both offensively and defensively
great soundtrack that fits with its characters and themes
beautiful graphics that make the environments feel alive
list

bconsb
list
the camera is a huge issue during combat because the characters are spread out around the battlefield
the game is rather easy for the most part however there are difficulty spikes on the bosses that come out of nowhere in which they will tank attacks and resist almost everything
bpound matesb are not useful 
list

h1storyh1 
its the year 2001 bichiban kasugab a low ranking byakuzagruntb who is enjoying his everyday life in the barakawa familyb the patriarch bmasumi arakawab asks him to take a fall for a murder he did not commit and he agrees to do so bichibanb thinks that by taking the fall he can be a btojo clanb hero however as soon as he gets out of prison no one greets him and he finds out that hardly  anyone remembers who he is 

the story is really well done there is so much i want to talk about its just that good byladb has possibly one of the best stories that i have ever experienced in a byakuzab game what makes the story great are the characters they all have their own personalities and special traits a good example is byu nanbab a homeless guy who has an attack where he will throw pigeon food at an enemy causing a bunch of pigeons to attack bkasugab loves video games and was a big fan of bdragon questb whenever he is in a battle he feels like he is in a turnbased rpgjrpg the character development is tied to the gameplay this is something i found very unique and something that i have never experienced in a bturnbased rpgb my two favourite characters have to be bjoongi hanb i love the way he fights with his base job and btianyou zhaob who is a leader of a gang he looks tough but does have a soft spot another touch i found interesting is that every time a new party member joins you the bdragon questb theme would play a very nice addition that i loved

h1gameplayh1
byladb is a unique bturnbased rpgb with that in mind it has some key features that i found very interesting if bkasugab is in front of an object he will sometimes pick it up and use it to attack this can sometimes result in the enemy being stunned these objects can range from bikes crates and furniture this feature is restricted to bkasugab however when an enemy is about to attack you can do a perfect block which will reduce damage and prevent stuns and bleeding effects you do have to time the button press at the right moment so it is a little hard to get used to 

when it comes to combat you have a normal attack that you can use and special attacks things like spewing fire from someones mouth or firing a gun these kinds of attacks will consume bmental points mpb later down the line you can get super moves and these kinds of attacks will deal a lot of damage and may place a status effect like paralysis or burn  if you ever get stuck in a fight you can call upon a bpound mateb they do cost money to use some of them will inflict poison decrease defence or just deal a lot of damage at the end of every battle you will get experience points for your character to level up there are two ways to level up your character your normal characters stats and their bjob rankb bjob ranksb are like your characters class a few examples can include bbody guardb bherob and bbreak dancerb a tip i will give is that putting bsaeko mukodab in the bidle jobb as she benefits from the support abilities that she has and the magical damage you can also bond with your party members this will help them get benefits like getting exp when not in battle or learning a btagteamb super move 
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2293179325

now i love byladb gameplay however it does suffer from a few issues the first issue is with the camera during battles when you are in a battle the characters and the enemies will spread out this can result in the camera angles moving while an enemy is attacking as a result at times you may not be able to do a perfect block and will take the full damage however the game is still easy but the game does have a difficulty spike when it comes to the bosses mainly because they can tank any damage as they can resist almost every type of attack it also does not help that you dont have much to work around it 

h1soundtrackh1 
the soundtrack has to be among the best that i have heard in a byakuzab game the main battle music is the byokohama battle themeb its so good it even makes farming seem fun and interesting i also enjoyed bomi rengob and bcoldbloodedb there are other songs i like as well but some of them are spoilers so i cant reveal much almost all the songs have this funky beat to them that make them all sound so appealing and feel like a dubstep kind of thing 

h1graphics and performanceh1 
byladb is beautiful the new city bisezaki ijinchob is alive and full of colours i found zero issues while i was playing with it running at a smooth 60 fps i was playing on an nvidia geforce gtx 1060 3gb amd ryzen 5 1500x quadcore processor 350 and 16 gb of ram you will need a decent computer to run the game but other than that you should be fine to play it
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid2296605103

h1final verdicth1
this has to be the best byakuzab game that i have played thus far it does everything that i want in a game and more a great story enjoyable combat and a kickass soundtrack there is a lot that byladb has to offer and i sadly could not everything if you are looking for a great bturnbased rpgb then this game is definitely for you  id also recommend playing if you are a byakuzab fan

#####

where is my peking duck dad

#####

you kill people with lobsters in this one

#####

this is one of those games you wish you could forget so you could play through again if you are new to jrpgs this is the game for you persona 5 royal is also a good one 

the graphics the characters and the story will leave you wanting more by the time you finish the game

1010 would strongly recommend

#####

yakuza like a dragon is the 8th game in the main yakuza franchise while many gameplay elements will be familiar to fans of the series there have been two big changes theres a new jrpg style turn based combat system and a new main character ichiban kasuga who starts the game as a low level member of the tojo clans arakawa family

h1combath1

in most fights youll have a party of four characters including ichiban and three of the five companions he meets during the main story you can change the active lineup at any time including during fights which prevents the problem that many rpgs have where some characters get ignored and become useless

on their turn each character can attack defend activate a special move or magic ability or use an item ichiban can also summon allies gained from substories to perform their own unique special moves

i was open minded about the change to turn based because ive played lots of great games which have a turn based combat system but unfortunately i didnt really enjoy ylads combat its not bad just kinda boring

my favourite turn based games have a very tactical feeling ill regularly take some time on my turn to analyse the situation identify the biggest threats plan how and when to use my best skills i very rarely felt the need to do this in ylad

with the exception of a few challenging bosses and a couple of optional dungeons the vast majority of combat encounters are against trash mobs who are so weak that you can usually knock out each enemy in one or two hits using only basic attacks even when enemies inflict the party with status effects like stun sleep bleed etc it rarely matters just ignore it hit them a couple of times and win the fight

while the previous games had a lot of trash mobs too at least real time combat is faster selecting each attack from a menu one at a time and then watching the same animation play out over and over again makes ylads combat feel repetitive

the further i progressed in the game the more time i spent in automatic mode where your characters will attack the nearest enemy by themselves id occasionally take manual control when i needed to heal somebody or during a boss fight but i mostly just wanted to get past the easy fights as quickly as possible

h1storycharactersh1

thankfully everything outside of combat maintains the same high quality as the other yakuza games

the story is complex involving yakuza chinese and korean gangs police and government officials business owners and civilians who all have their own agendas with lots of alliances and betrayals this is the first yakuza game ive played that had english voice acting and its mostly very good

ichiban is a very likeable protagonist kiryu is one of my all time favourite video game characters and the fact that i didnt miss him should tell you how much i liked ichiban it helps that his energetic personality is almost the exact opposite to kiryus quiet intensity which gives cutscenes a different feel ichibans companions are all very interesting too i wish they were more involved in the substories though as they always disappear while ichiban talks to npcs by himself and only assist when a fight happens

as always when you want to take a break from the main quest there are lots of other things to do in the open world with over fifty substories and several minigames theres the usual stuff like golf baseball darts sega arcades and the casino plus new activities like kart racing multiple choice exams on various subjects to raise ichibans personality stats and a wacky qte based minigame where you need to help ichiban stay awake while watching films in the local cinema

h1technicalh1

technical performance is excellent my pc is 5 years old but i was able to maintain a consistent 60 fps while playing in 1440p with every setting maxed except i turned off multisampling this had no noticeable effect on the picture quality and the graphics look great especially while wandering around the cities

i didnt encounter any bugs or crashes and the controls work great on my xbox 360 controller

h1recommendationh1

despite my disappointment with the combat system i still definitely recommend yakuza fans to play like a dragon even if its just for the excellent story

as usual i suggest starting with yakuza zero and playing in order even though theres a new protagonist the story does follow on from the previous games and knowledge of past characters and events will be beneficial especially in the later chapters it might take a long time to play through the whole franchise but trust me its worth it

iurlhttpsstoresteampoweredcomcurator35145066 feel free to follow my review pageurli

h1the gist of ith1
after years of great yakuza games rgg studio gives us a fresh new direction for the series in the form of a jrpg and luckily its a really good start  

 uthe good partsu
the protagonist ichi is more of an idiot but a very emotional and charismatic character than what were used to 
your companions are just as good as ichi 
amazing soundtrack
good story that gets incredibly emotional in the last chapters

uthe bad partsu
combat is fun and diverse the first half but gets very stale late game and youre just going to spam the same aoe spell over and over
the dungeons visual variety is sht 
yokohama is larger than what were used to but less appealing or interesting 

h1storyh1
if youve played the previous yakuza games youll know what to expect from the story and if not well youre in for a surprise the tonality of the game just like all other yakuza can easily switch from dramatic brutal to hilarious ridiculous its a fresh restart for the series and all new players can easily get it without having to know the previous games if youre familiar with the older game youll be greeted with quite some amazing surprisesappearances 

you play as ichiban kasuga a yakuza in service of masumi harakawa a man who saved you from the streets of kamurocho while you were young as you go around your daily tasks things go bad for the yakuza family and masumi asks you to do the ultimate sacrifice and that is to go to prison instead of another important family member 18 years pass and youre greeted by a whole new world but things dont just stop there as you get shot and dragged to yokohama where you have to figure out what happened 

as you progress through the story youll meet a fantastic and diverse cast of companions adachi an excop nanba a homeless exnurse saeko a hostess and a few others later in the game theyre all great and they each have their own story and background that you can discover and theyre always going to be around you and part of the story 

as with all yakuza games the first few chapters and the last ones are always going to be the best with the middle having just enough to keep you going like a dragon has an incredible last few chapters especially for the fans of the series and even if youre new youre going to love the drama that unfolds ichi goes all out with the performance more than any other protagonist in the series the only issue i had is that hes an idiot most of the time and does repeat himself more often than not 

finally there cannot be a yakuza game without the substories and their moral lessons they range from funny stupid to emotional and sad 

story rating 910

h1gameplayh1
from brawler to turnbased rpg is not something some fans may like and if youre disappointed by the new direction i highly recommend judgment from the same studio which is exactly what youre looking for and possibly the best game from rgg anyway like a dragons gameplay is certainly a fresh and good direction for the series and the turnbased combat is as ridiculous and fun as you can expect 

the way this works is ichiban sees the whole world in his eyes as his favorite game dragon quest and as he enters combat the enemies themselves also change their aspect into what he imagines they would look like the visual representation of the enemies is hilarious and incredibly varied in combat you each take turns and can freely attack whomever you want but cannot move your characters the skills are assigned based on the jobs you acquire in the real world and they can range from bodyguard to a chef your companions also have their range of jobs they can change you can always switch from one job to another but each job has its own level and as you level up you gain new skills in that job as well as character skills so its ideal to only experiment at first and go with one until the end unless you enjoy grinding 

the problem with the combat is that after a while it gets boring which is a common issue with most turnbased jrpgs late game enemies and bosses become health sponges and youll end up just using 2 or 3 skills out of 15 with the exception of bosses smaller enemies while very varied will rarely get the chance to use their skills as you just mop the floor with them  

besides the usual skills as you progress through the story and substories you will be given special summons that can aid you immensely in combat but at the cost of lots of money the best and only way to become rich is to finish your job at the ichiban confections which like all previous yakuza games its a management minigame it is very automated and boring compared to the previous games but it does net you 2 mil yen at the end and from that point forward every time you end a period besides giving you a massively overpowered aoe skill as well 

hopefully future sequels will emphasize more on the use of all skills especially buffs and debuffs and will fix the issues with lategame grindstaleness 

gameplay rating 810

h1audioh1
youll be doing yourself a huge disfavor if youre going to play this game with the english dub its a japanese game set in japan about yakuza it would be ridiculous to play with anything but the original japanese voice the voice actors do an incredible job with the acting and showing emotion especially ichiban which goes all out in the final chapters truly incredible work 

all yakuza games had an incredible soundtrack and like a dragon is just the same the music beats especially the boss ones are tight and fit well with the combat the sounds and everything else related are all just as good 

audio rating 910

h1graphics performance and tech analysish1
the yakuza games need a new engine or they need to tweak it for newer generations of hardware especially on pc it runs good but there were times where framerate tanked especially in the crowded area where there was a ton of grass speaking of grass the engine has no idea how to render it youll see the grass popping out and rendering itself at least 2 times 3 feet in front of you it was horrible to look at but luckily the park is the only area in the game with grass 

another huge issue is the dungeon visual variety its bad clearly the budget went in other places and they just said fck it to this aspect the sewers where you can grind and level up are absolutely the worst kind of dungeon ive seen in any jrpg ever the other dungeons while they at least look different are still linear and devoid of any detail a shame really 

the main city where you spend most of your time does not look that great or interesting either compared to satenbori or kamurocho and its most likely due to budget and engine limitations they need to do better 

graphics performance and tech analysis score  710

h1conclusionh1
despite some issues with the lategame combat and the not so impressive visual quality of the locations and dungeons like a dragon packs an emotional story with a great new protagonist a fantastic soundtrack and hopefully the beginning of a great new adventure for ichiban and his companions 

h1final score 8210h1

#####

turn based combat check
social links check
social stats check
set in modern japan check
finally a persona game where you play as adults with midlife crisis

jokes aside games really damn good

#####

ichiban gaming 

#####

my favorite homeless simulator

#####

beat the game with the power of friendship and this baseball bat i found on the side of the road

#####

this was my first yakuza game and damn this is a gem the story music combat everything was perfect worth

#####

37 hrs in and if anyone makes kasuga cry i will kill everyone in the room and then myself

#####

just finished the story am in an emotional state 58 hours put in to the game the return on investment is incredible each mission and side mission is either heartfelt or humourous the characters personalities are infectious and the combat animations are brutal if you love jrpgs if you love japan if you want more heart and good morals from your games this is it

#####

i really hated ichiban at first now 80 hours in however hes one of my favorite characters in anything ever it also helps that the writing is so good the quests are amazing and the gameplay is really fun overall i love this game and cant wait for more in ichis saga

#####

this game is a legitimate masterpiece that ill never forget

#####

h1 dragon quest xii  eric andre and the power of friendship h1

if youre here for the yakuza gameplay buy another game
if youre here for the story and world of yakuza this game might be for you

the game plays as though it were the sexy and fun lovechild of dragon quest xi and persona 5 with a bit of final fantasy 12 added for good measure

the story is pretty standard for rgg studios yakuza series someone gets shot someone goes to prison for something they didnt do someone has to make things right

if you like yakuza more traditional turn based rpgs and crazy stories that grip harder than rigor mortis this game is for you i dont really know what to say to sell this to you its a great game that starts well and keeps going strong

#####

this game is an absolute masterpiece coming from a guy that has an attention span like a squirrel i was able to sit and focus  on this game whenever i had the time to play wholesome violent intriguing captivating and all around so much fun would recommend to any person thats looking for a turnbased rpg with an amazing story and amazing characters

1010 would play again

#####

bmy partners and shareholders please accept my most earnest recommendationb

#####

i hate turn based rpgs but i could not stop until i 100 this monster of a game you are doing yourself a disservice by not playing it

#####

the first jrpg that isnt anime


#####

dont forget to turn the audio to japanese

#####

the change to turnbased works so well honestly this is probably my favourite yakuza game in the entire series easy recommend

#####

this is a rather difficult one for me for the most part this game is excellent superb and a great spinoff from the mainline yakuza series in tone story and general execution your jrpg squad is essentially a bunch of nobodies who can swap classes by essentially signing up for different gig positions this means a bunch of fighting styles from the mainline games return albeit in a turnbased pickyourmovefromalist format with that being the main difference the rest of the game is pretty similar to the mainline games and while you dont need to have played them to enjoy this game there are also a ton of references to the rest of this universe in here some a little more obvious than others

one of the more interesting changes in this game is that its fully voiced in english for the first time fans of persona 5 will have their ears ringing as its essentially that entire cast voicing everyone from main party members to small sidestory characters along with some other wellknown voices to fill out the rest of the roster the bartender at your main club was a particularly nice surprise for myself as a metal gear fan essentially its a great cast with great direction though i wouldnt fault you for turning the voices back to japanese as while most fit there are definitely moments where the casting breaks down particularly for characters with smaller roles

and now we get to the difficult part at the time of playing this id played three mainline yakuza games 1 and 2 kiwami and 0 so not completely immersed but enough to know and enjoy how the games usually played particularly in their flow of difficulty typical yakuza fare first real boss fight is an absolute menace usually because youre fighting one of the final bosses of the game and they dont want to make them look like a pushover there will also be a few spikes in difficulty with other major fights but for the most part if you play the game and stick with it you wont hit any real walls

the problem here is in creating like a dragon they went a little too hard into some of the things i hate about jrpgs including spongy enemies and the most grotesque sin of all a large amount of grinding when playing this i did a lot of research as to what i was doing wrong and the results all came up the same i needed to just grind all of my characters up by doing this same dungeon over and over again so i got in this rhythm of efficiency in gaining experience and cash at a steady rate so i could do this whenever a wall suddenly appeared that in my opinion is a capital sin of game design i dont care if thats how jrpgs have always worked they dont have to and they shouldnt if the rest of the game is enjoyable without it you should pace your game for better progression or come up with an alternative already to compound this problem like a dragon isnt even consistent about it and frequently doesnt give you a heads up when youre about to try to progress without being ready in one case i played through an entire long dungeon complete with a stealth section and a bunch of big fights only to be stopped in my tracks by a boss fight that was leagues harder than anything else in the dungeon so far to the point where it was completely impossible for me to complete it and so i left and came back when my level was higher still the same equipment and was able to complete it kinda undercut the awesome moment the game was trying to push

but like ive said its not all bad because while these moments do happen they are far from the majority of the game most of it is wrapped up in a really fun combat system involving tons of whacky classesjobs and the moves that come with them on top of it all the crown jewel is as always the story its standard for yakuza in that youve got a group of interesting and compelling characters big changing events taking place in the underworld with a great blend of seriousness and levity to keep it engaging in short charming as always overall i definitely recommend the game but i didnt want folks going into it without a fair warning as to its downsides

please play this game it is peak gaming

#####

im gonna miss these guys when i finish the game 

#####

i had a 9 year old a moving truck sized roomba and a literal chicken in charge of managing a brothel just cause i could

#####

this is probably the most wellpolished yakuza game to date everything from the interface to the minigames clearly has a lot of effort put into it

new city is big and distinct story is the usual dark affair with a lot of plot twists some dumber than others new minigames are fun aside from the management which is the worst its ever been characters are very likeable and the new protagonist is a significant step away from kiryus stoic quietness and it all works very well together with a great party dynamic graphics are topnotch and so is the soundtrack humor and sidequests are more ridiculous than ever and had me chuckling at multiple occasions

all that said i cannot stress enough how much i hate the new combat system it is the standard jrpg grindfest where big number  victory in combat it especially becomes painfully apparent during the final third of the game where you dont stand a chance without grinding out both levels and the materials for the best weapons in the game after which all boss fights turn into spam your strongest moves in between heals and repeat for 20 turns as bosses are just damage sponges that can soak up a huge amount of your special moves while oneshotting your party members if youre not leveled up enough

the zaniness of jobs and special moves is very funny and entertaining for the first 10 hours of the game after which it just becomes a nuisance that undercuts the very dark tone of the story like in previous games boss fights carry an emotional weight to them and a story significance to the main character which is thrown out the window as soon as the fight starts and the sm queen whipspanks the boss while a host sprays him with champagne its a complete tonal whiplash not to mention that the turnbased system ruins any sort of momentum while the characters do spectacular moves and exchange blows in the cutscenes only for everything to halt as the fighters awkwardly shuffle in place waiting for their turn

i appreciate the rgg team trying out new stuff but i have never been this torn on a series i love this much i have thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this game except the combat and i sincerely hope the series wont continue in this direction

#####

helll nahh dawg wtf i went to go sell this fella some weed and he done finessed me with an ichibuck 

#####

this game is absolutely amazing ichibuns10 

ichiban kasuga is a fantistics new protagonist
all of his party members are very unique and likeable
one of the best story 
turnbased combat is fun looking forward to see the improvement in the sequel
previous main characters got the respect they deserved
ending made me cry 
                                h1 i highly recommend you to give this one a try 
                                           you wont regret it  h1

#####

definitely the best yakuza game yet

#####

one of the best game i have played this year  the story  the gameplay  the music everything is polished and enjoyable  if you are a yakuza fan or just starting out the yakuza series this is a must play game  the voice actor for this game is amazing at the role they given  the substories are entertaining and funny  combat is unique and enjoyable  animation is amazing  highly recommend give this game a try 

#####

if you like rpgs and need a good cry whether it be from feelings or laughter this game is well worth the purchase

an excellent story with a lot of nuance and the best protagonist one could hope for we love ichiban kasuga in this house and only want to see him succeed

#####

let me start by saying this is not only the third console i have acquired this game for after xbox and ps5 it is also the third time i have completed this game with all achievements it is just that good

when i first saw yakuza like a dragon being advertised i knew very little about the yakuza series but found myself curious to know more the idea of a jrpg about a group of middleaged men roaming around the streets of japan getting into fights against all manner of wacky enemies blending the turnbased combat of most jrpgs into what seemed at first glance like a mundane setting reminded me a bit of games like earthbound ni no kuni wrath of the white witch or south park the stick of truth i figured why not it seemed like it would be my kind of fun what i got was so much more than i bargained for sure the zany fun was definitely there but along with it i got a really heartfelt story about the challenges of starting over from rock bottom finding the strength to keep going and never giving up on friends family or yourself

ichiban kasuga functions as the games lead protagonist and its emotional center ive since gone back to revisit other installments in the yakuza series focused on the story of kazuma kiryu and from what ive played ichiban shakes up the formula in ways that kiryu previously did not kiryu is a stoic but passionate man whose internal monologue gives players much better insight to his character ichiban conversely wears all his emotions on his sleeve its a different kind of passionate with an infectious and relentless sort of positive attitude that you cannot help but root for it helps that ichiban is also supported by a colorful cast of characters that make up the rest of his party they serve not only as allies but as close friends and confidants who help ichiban make sense of a world thats advanced significantly while he was locked away in prison

the gameplay itself is fairly basic as far as your standard jrpg goes theres also a good deal of minigames that are implemented brilliantly the business management mode and kart racer in particular really stand out the job system is pretty clever as is the way its weaved into the narrative that being said there is definitely room for improvement particularly when it comes to the implementation and layout of different skills that the characters use though the job system does encourage experimentation to see what builds work best for each character i often found there was a lot of overlap between job skills and not enough unique skills that made each character stand out 

my other main criticism has to do with the games pacing and overall balance the first several chapters are a bit of a slow burn especially as the setting and characters are established but maintains a pretty decent pace from chapters 611 its around chapter 12 that the game suddenly undergoes an intense spike in both difficulty and enemy level that took me by surprise and im sure most other players as well given that the games main story campaign takes place over the course of 15 chapters i wonder if this was perhaps an attempt to amp up the difficulty before the end its definitely an enjoyable experience dont get me wrong but it was a bit abrupt still this is the first game in the yakuza series that was presented as a full jrpg as opposed to the classic beatemup formula so it makes sense that there would still be some mechanical issues and hiccups here and there i can only hope that rgg studios has learned from this and will provide an even tighter experience when developing yakuza 8

in spite of my criticisms this quirky game about a goofy protagonist blew all my expectations out of the water and like ichiban kasuga himself has made it to the top and become my favorite game of all time it may not be the traditional yakuza experience but its a blast to play and a story that still tugs at my heartstrings even now could not recommend this game more

#####

im not a big fan of jrpgs nor am i particularly familiar with the yakuza series but ive enjoyed every moment of this game the story and characters were extremely memorable and well written and the games unique take on turn based combat never got old

i am eagerly awaiting the sequel which i gather will be in a similar style

#####

seong hui is not playable but saeko stepped on me in one of her attacks so its all cool

#####

arguably the most compelling characters story from rgg since yakuza 0 the gameplay is surprisingly engaging and i enjoyed it as someone who usually dislikes turnbased combat really enjoyed it

#####

this game is the epitome of what happens if you combine a polished turnbased fighting game with amazing characters and a massive dose of melodrama this game easily made me feel so much for the characters i usually dont like one or two in shallow ways but all the characters here captured my heart like no other and made me feel like they were my friends and family too i was so sad to see it all end  

i cant wait to play the sequel in a few months

#####

real yakuza play on pc with a mouse and keyboard

great homeless simulator

#####

yakuza is turnbased now you have a party jobs to level up and a bunch of jrpg stuff is that a bad thing i dont think so because its fun as heck and it feels like a breath of fresh air 
is it still yakuza if it doesnt have realtime combat oh yes its very much yakuza as anyone whos played the first 3 hours can tell you 

is it truly a great spot to start the series yes and no on the one hand its a new storyline though it has references to stuff that happened in previous games or characters from previous games and it has a new combat system on the other hand its still very much yakuza and if you didnt like yakuza before you probably wont like this game now the first three hours will probably either draw you in completely or make you hate it

im only 10 hours in so of course i havent seen most of the new stuff but so far ive enjoyed this game a lot and would recommend it to anyone who liked the previous games in the series even if they think that the new combat system wont be something theyll enjoy spoiler alert i think that even the staunchest realtime combat yakuza fan will end up loving this one

#####

ichiban knocked a guys teeth because he called his boss kinda mid

#####

finished the story still finishing up a few things to complete everything but if youre a fan of the other yakuza games then i highly recommend this one even with the changed combat it still feels like a yakuza game its very enjoyable

#####

buy it its amazing

shoutout to yakuza majimaposting

based and nagoshipilled

#####

i have a crawfish and a chicken as allies best game ever

#####

updated  today i finished the game and it was insightful and impressive one of the best game from the land of the rising sun

disclaimer  i never play any of yakuza game before but dont get me wrong i always interested in to this series but my bad habit is i really lazy to read subtitle all the time while playing so this one is my entrance

alright i think my progression in this game is just too early to provide the review to the community according to my playtime as you guys can see but after 30 hours i spending time to grinding for xp enjoying with mini games and definitely most of all the story 
its chill me to my soul and make me look at my bare feet look back in to the past then i turn my head look straight forward through my path that im walking on it 

i mean i was almost be a goner but i am still alive 

so i would say the story of this game could impact your life my life somehow for sure 
this is solid aaa game 

you know at first when i was buying the game i thought damn it this game is really expensive and i feel regret because i think i will not like this game

but hell yeah even the early of the game such as 30 hours could impact me this much i have no doubt that i would play this game for over 100 hours for sure 

oh by the way if you looking for open world game thats look and feel lively and immersive this one is for you if you looking at the map it may make you feel its too small to call it open world game 
compare to the others in the same genre but when you immerse yourself with it you will totally feel that this is genuinely open world game that you will love i dont know sorry but i love it already and will keep love it more and more

talking about the price of this game full price will is worth every penny of yours but of course you can wait for sales or looking for legitimate retail key shop

and last suggestion you should just only purchase standard edition because other editions will just giving you a topping there is no story expansion or season pass for this game that help you speed up the pace of progression in the game and mini games also costumes if you interested in any dlc you could purchase them separately later 

okay its time for me to go back and immerse my soul to this game 

seaya my gaming comrades

lobster

#####

im not a fan of jrpgs but i loved this game

its a yakuza game without the beatem up combat and a ton more content a new charismatic protagonist and a whole lot of love poured into this game i adored it i have gripes of course but theyre so small i cant even think about them while writing this

really what a lovely experience i look forward to what comes next

#####

local man gets shot and proceeds to beat people up with bat

#####

yakuza like a dragon is the goodest yakuza game and ichiban is the goodest boy in the series

#####

quite possibly the best game in the whole series takes the style and strengths from previous games and doubles down on it all including the new cast of characters and story the switch to turn based combat works so well and shines throughout

#####

next gen crustacean ai

#####

you played for 100 hours and dont recommend it  yes i finished ylad out of sheer stubbornness this game has a lot to offer a solid main story beautiful visuals a cast of very likable largerthanlife characters tons and tons of side quests and minigames overthetop combat drama emotion romance and bromance in short its got everything a yakuza game should haveunfortunately it is all buried under a mountain of grind and that is awful even the most fun activity becomes tiresome if you have to repeat it to get anywhere doing the same thing 203050 times in a row over and over again   want to advance the story you have to level up your character and the right combination of jobs classes because majority of story progression is gated by boss battles the last third of the story starting in chapter 12 features a difficulty spike that is impossible to get past if you havent been grinding levels beforehand want to level up only through combat which is turnbased and therefore fairly slow side quests do not give xp just money and items early on you get your xp from roaming street mobs but as you level up they stop giving meaningful xp so the game offers you 3 dungeons specifically for grinding enjoy running them over and over to get to the required levels to be able to pass the chapter 12 difficulty spike want to make money play the management minigame which is fun as hell early on but becomes a braindead chore after youve played it a few dozen times it stops being fun its just another repetitive time sink that the game needs you to do so you can buy and upgrade lategame gear want to craft endgame gear besides money you need to farm components and materials some of which are random drops and some of which are locked behind minigames which range from collect discarded cans on the street to play shogi japanese chess at grandmaster level over and over again again this wouldnt be a problem if you didnt have to grind each activity dozens of times to get what you need and want want to explore be prepared to be constantly interrupted by roaming street mobs which you have to fight in turnbased mode they always aggro on you when they come in range even if you are 10 levels higher after you level up sufficiently they dont even give enough xp to justify the time spent fighting them just meaningless speed bumps that interrupt you and slow you down you just throw out your biggest aoe attacks and hope you oneshot them all so you can move on late in the game you get an item that prevents enemies from spawning in the street and its a massive relief  except by then i was so tired of the game that i wanted to just be done with it in short this game doesnt respect your time and involves so much repetition and grind that it negates all the fun that it has to offer i dont think ive done this much grinding even when i used to play mmos unless repetition and grind is something you enjoy or you are stubbornly determined to finish the main story give it a pass and choose another yakuza title

#####

just another masterpiece from the yakuza series

great graphics music storyline gameplay and character developments what more could you ask for

though might be offputting to some players who have played the previous games in the series i personally enjoyed the turnbased combat system

all in all a fantastic single player jrpg

#####

h1 once youre at rock bottom the only way forward is up but the bottom doesnt have to be all dark and gloomy if you can stand and look up youll see the light of hope there h1

it is rare for me to muster the patience to write reviews about anything but does this deserve some credithowever a disclaimer dont waste your time if turnedbased jrpg isnt your thing then get up and grab your credit card if youre looking for an engaging and exciting experience that will make you laugh out loud and cry while also being so compelling youll want to take days off work to play more of it

h1 pros h1
1 like the rest of the yakuza series youll often feel like youve just started watching a tv series you cant put down because of the deep and intricate storyline that leaves you wanting more
2 the characters will endear the hell out of you and become so attached to the protagonist that youll find yourself genuinely caring for a fictional character
3 youll almost never run out of things to do because of the side content substories dragonkart management minigame old sega games dungeons battle arenas and sooo much more
4 the turn based action comes as a shock to begin with but you very quickly grow accustomed to it and actually it is a great and refreshing change
5 no need to play the previous 7 games in order to understand the story but you will miss some references and easter eggs spoiler majima and saejima boss fight still scares me spoiler 

h1 cons h1
1 omfg the encounters in this game are so fing annoying most of the time when i am free roaming i cant move 2 steps after a street fight without getting into another fight and sometimes they spawn out of nowhere and infront of you this is the only problem i have with this game

h1 conclusion h1
i had my doubts when i first heard about it especially as the mc is no longer kiryu but rest assured this game is a true yakuza game the mc ichiban quickly becomes very likeable and the supporting cast around him are all amazing as always the main plot can be quite intense its full of all the twists and surprises you have come to expect likewise the substories are as hilarious as everas someone who dont like turn based games the combat system never bothered me and i enjoyed it alot finally thank you sega for this awesome game looking forward to yakuza 8

yakuza like a dragon is a crime thriller that follows ichiban kasuga and friends as they beat up thugs hallucinated from thin air in a long and arduous quest to deliver rice crackers to the people of tokyo and osaka 
there is also karaoke in it

#####

a chicken made more money than me

#####

this game is 110 yakuza 

everything is here the amazing soundtrack the overthetop characters minigames and subplots the rpg system is more fleshed out and has more depth than most contemporary pure rpgs

i was worried at first about the switch from the beat em up style to turnbased rpg but holy hell man they knocked it out of the park the fighting feels just as engaging and fun with a whole host of nifty little mechanics to keep fights interesting a job system that lets you swap the class of any of your party members easily each job has crossclass skills that can be unlocked so you can customize every ones skill sets to an extreme if you want

everything is here i fully recommend this game to anyone

as a side note they added an option to choose between the english voiceover and the original japanese voices which is great if you are like me and used to playing the yakuza games in the original japanese

#####

ichiban

#####

i really dislike jrpgs if you do too you should still play this game because its amazing its probably my favorite spin on the jrpg formula and while it still runs into some of the classic jrpg annoyances its just too good to put down

also you can slap a tiger with a fat stack of yen in this game

#####

nice game i like zhao

#####

this game was my initial introduction to the yakuza games and wow was it a strong start for me 

the presentation story soundtrack and gameplay blew me away that i stopped playing around chapter 7 just so i could savor the story and play the original games to get more context to what was going on i mean i didnt expect me to blast through the previous kiryu games yakuza 06 before i finished this game but i did and it was all worth it i got more enjoyment out of the world seeing previous characters come back here and there while enjoying the already new and fresh take on the new protagonist of the story ichiban kasuga now im not saying you need to play the previous games to enjoy this game i mean on my initial playthrough i was still having a blast not knowing any of the legacy characters when they did show up which was just here and there which is the thing most of the characters in this game are new characters to the series making it a good place to jump into the franchise as newcomers

gameplay  though i do prefer the original beat em up combat of the previous titles i didnt hate the new turnbased rpg style sure battles take even longer now and your damage relies more on stat increases than previous titles but even with those problems i still had a blast my favorite part with the combat of these games are the heat animations and that is what every ability gives you here some wacky ass over the top animation correlating with the job fantasy your character is fitted with sometimes i would just try out a new ability that does not do anything for me in the situation just to see the unique animation and the job system having you swap different party members to different classes for free with no restrictions had me trying out new things left and right in fact it got so bad that at a certain difficulty spike in the game i would keep getting 1 shotted in a cutscene due to my crazy job switching keeping me at a low level the poundmates were also amusing to use and serves as this games summons in case you need a helping hand at lower levels however the grind to max level was painful it took me a month to grind my bis weapons for all jobs and max all jobs for all characters i really do hope in the next game theyll introduce something to ease the grind like maybe shared exp boosters or universal jobs or something at least

setting  all cities you visit all slap of course you got the iconic tokyo streets of kamurocho in the prologue and endgame aswell as sotenbori which also returns midway through the campaign all the cities have a handful of things to do in them and are fleshed out but the main focus is around the new location yokohama isezaki ijincho the new location has so much variety in scenery and things to get in lost in i wont spoil much but this is without a doubt on par with how iconic kamurocho is 

sidestory  the sidestory content for this game is very strong the business mini game is a complete step forward from the real estate royale mini game that played like a mobile game in yakuza 0 aswell as the controversial clan creator mode taking the topdown rts gameplay and molding it into more turn based combat within the shareholding meeting segments when you have to resolve questions via rpg styled combat most of my hours in this game is from this mini game alone and i was stunned and a little overwhelmed at the amount of mechanics i saw with the buisness mini game at the start of it but after powering though i quite easily became addicted the other big mini game would be the mario kart inspired racing game dragon kart and that is exactly what it is it was good fun and i had a blast upgrading and obtaining new karts along with experimenting in time trial trying to beat the highscores of my fellow players it was just simple dumb fun

mini games  a nice blend of previous dragon engines mini games you come to know through past titles and some new weird ones like can quest which is like a third person version of pac man or the movie theater where you try to hold out on sleeping until the end i like what they did with the bar chat mini game from yakuza 6 and molded it into the party member bond reputation to get to know you party better while obtaining skills for that member while youre at it another mini game that was changed was the cabaret mini game which has just been reduced to a health and mp mana restoration and also can be used to upgrade your bonds the fastest and honestly i have no feelings about the change i mean the cabaret mini game has changed a lot throughout the games and can be enjoyed in some games while in others can be a slog what im trying to say here is that im glad they did something different for the cabaret club instead of the same old same old even if its a downgrade in areas

def one of the best games in the series and if youre new or are familiar with the series yakuza like a dragon is another fresh slate restart making it easy to jump in

#####

an incredible game and a very worthy entry into the already stunning yakuza series

i enjoyed every second of this game the rpg mechanics are excellent the amount of creativity thrown into the rpg aspect of yakuza 7 is simply stunning each job had its own unique style with skills and animations with very little copy and pasting going on everything feels original and fleshed out the english voice acting is also pretty good i also played yakuza 0 kiwami and kiwami 2 in japanese with subtitles and has a host of quality well respected voice actors sega spared no expense with the voices in yakuza 7

as expected storyline music minigames and overall feel of the world are incredible as expected this feels like a true aaa game experience no corners cut the dragon quest references are awesome with ichiban acting like a kid at times regarding being the hero who defeats the villains and its charming and wonderful

the only part i would say i didnt like quite as much was the business management sim its not bad and you get an optional and very good party member out of it but it can seem far more complex than it really is and i had to look up some guides at first to get the hang of it but once you figure it out its a good way to get some easy yen speaking of yen money in this game is not as easy to come by in comparison with previous games dont expect to be walking around at all times with 50 million yen in the bank youre gonna be pretty broke for the most part and have to scavenge and sell a lot before you get a steady income going

minigames are the standard affair we have the classics space harrier super hang on fantasy zone virtua fighter 2 but also an excellent port of virtua fighter 5 which is a nice addition as well as baseball  golf which are identical to kiwami 2 so nothing new there however the latest minigame is the brand new dragon kart and boy is it fun

and to answer the question i see asked everywhere

ive never played any of the games before can i start with this one

of course other than some character references here and there this is a nice fresh start with a new location and protagonist

overall yakuza 7 is an easy 1010 for me and i voted it as my game of the year in the steam awards

#####

good game made me less depressed

#####

one of the best video games ever made ichiban is one of the most genuinely inspiring protagonists across all the games ive played the game handles adult friendships in such a real way it makes you think that the future may have a lot positive to bring the turnbased combat starts off awful but after the training wheels get taken off it really gets going the combat might be a dealbreaker for some but i still highly recommend giving it a shot yakuza like a dragon handles a genre shift with such style and gusto youd never that this was their first turnbased rpg the story is some of the best writing ever produced from rgg studio a plot thatll leave you in pain until the very end in a good way yakuza like a dragon gets a solid 1010 from me

#####

ichiban is good guy but i love majima best

#####

i was a fool i figured i would just start with this game and go back to the beginning im enjoying this game so much that today im deleting it from my library and playing yakuza 0 im interested in everything before this now see you guys in a year or two when i finally beat all of the previous games

edit just finished yakuza 0 it was totally worth going back and playing

well i dont even know where to start i just finished the main yakuza saga from yakuza 0 till yakuza lad and it was one rollercoaster of emotions and feelings that took me around half an year one of the best gaming experiencees i had for a singleplayer game saga

ima say it the games are a masterpiece and im really glad i stumbled on them last year because its the perfect type of singleplayer one player like me can wish with one of the best developed and well written stories i have played yet all expanded in 8 games with tons of things to do no matter if enjoyable or rageable still suffering fantasy zone ptsd from yakuza 0 lol

other remarkable aspect of the yakuza games the battle themes holy sht one of the best of any game i have played yet and really well made and composed specially the ones in the latest games from yakuza lad and yakuza 6 that transmite a powerful message about the enemy we are facing very dramatic and energetic something i enjoy a lot when im playing any game maximum note for the team that delivered such bangers

the change of the combat system from the previous games to an rpg style on lad was something i was looking for to play since i started on yakuza 0 and its really damn good and wouldnt mind that the devs would carry with it over the next sequels

also about yakuza lad the amount of easter eggs the game contains of the previous games is amazing its a very similar mirror of kiwami 1 and new players wont even know about it p

sadly the devs didnt released the judgment games to a pc version which i would be thrilled to play them but i heard a sequel for yakuza lad is on development and on its way soon and i cant wait bring it on

#####

i really wanted to like this game and i did through the most of the time the beginning is promising and the middle part is really interesting full of new twists and mechanics but the late game is just tiring grind for exp grind for materials collecting bugs waste multiple 5 minutes to grind money mini game grind continue the story 30 minutes way to boss made of too easy trash mobs 1 hour boss fight in which he can randomly one shot main hero ending the run because he can attack twice or thrice in row


difficulty is really uneven insultingly easy in the begging and giant grind stat check and the end and combat system is no fun at all in previous yakuzas even when fighting 12 healthbars you could have fun by smashing all the bikes on their heads here ichiban very rarely use the environment and most crazy attacks are cutscenes with bleak background and even not that crazy like one of the last tiers is just using a bat like nunchako some are cool like firing a orbital laser but the potential as these attacks are enhanced by ichiban imagination is mostly unrealized


overall i dont think the combat system change was for the better it mostly slows down the game it doesnt provide anything interesting or new but it takes away kiryus environmental finishers story is good but i thinks i will watch on youtube gameplay is just a drag right now

machine gun kiss で  just fall in loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove

#####

this game is a masterpiece
i have no words i have no words to explain just how perfect this game is
everything is amazing ost characters character development side quests story combat everything
please get this game play every game in the series this is if not one of the best games ever not even joking

#####

q what game genre is this
a yes

#####

one of the best games i have ever played in my life
the story the missions side quests and battle system are all great
the world the characters everything about this game is well done and well though out

#####

despite the controversial change from real time action to turnbased combat this is still a yakuza game through and through an intricate main story along with goofy substories for comic relief and various other distractions like casinos and an assortment of minigames

while turnbased gameplay has been around forever the spice rgg studio has added really freshens it up and gives a longlasting appeal the music hits the attacks themselves are remarkably stylish and still entertaining to watch a hundred times over and youre rewarded for fast reactions to perfectly guard against an incoming strike or add more force to your own

if youve enjoyed one yakuza game youll probably like the rest of them including this one ive been playing it constantly over the last few days and its been a blast should they decide to continue making yakuza games in jrpg format ill gladly buy them

#####

yakuza like a dragon is a better dragon quest than dragon quest itself throwing jabs to the stupid decision square enix made to delist the original dragon quest xi and replaced it with an overpriced and inferior version of the game

like a dragon is really good and a better mature themed dragon quest but i would be cautious about segas actions in the futureconsumer wise i recommend the normal versionno need for dlcs and dont install the pachinko dlc just in case

i did not expect to spend a few hours doing property management and forget i was trying to stop a gang war

#####

this was my introduction to the yakuza series i love it the rpg mechanics and turn based combat are a lot more fun than i expected it to be the story was pretty engaging as well i recently beat like a dragon gaiden with kiryu and it made me wanna come back and finish this one that i was 1215 chapters of the way thru theres so much to do in this game from the mini games i dont have much interest in to the parttime hero side content to the side missions building the bonds with your party to increase the xp they gain when not participating in combat with you and open up new jobs for them to be to those jobs themselves and ranking up in them theres so much to this game you can even spend time in a business management sim where you try to rank up your corporation to reach the top of the games stock market within that sim is a whole system of employing people leveling them up and promoting them to increase their max level different stats theyre better at and balancing all of that when upgrading your properties to make the most money each day and then after 4 days doing a shareholder meeting where you try to get the support of your board to further increase your stock price and potentially your rank in the market
even if youve never played or had any interest in a yakuza game before i definitely recommend checking this one out its so much fun to play and theres an insane amount to do it theres even a workshop to craft and upgrade your gear and a colosseum of sorts where you can battle your way up thru the tower defeating stronger and stronger enemies and getting pretty solid rewards for it theres also a plethora of enemies and different ones have damage types theyre resistant or weak to so youre encouraged to make sure your weapons andor skills you use are dealing the right kind of damage to more effectively defeat your enemies one of my favorite ways to play is try to brainwash the enemies so they fight each other instead of my team i also like that there are ways to unlock certain job skills so that you can use them even if youre not currently playing as that job with one of your characters it further encourages trying out different jobs classes for your party and ranking them up beyond just raising your stats speaking of stats the game has the standard rpg stats of hp mp attack defense etc as well as resistances to different damage types for your characters but ichiban also has personality traits you can level up for him that will also boost his stats if you do so these can be raised in a number of ways from certain dialogue choices during events to level up the bond between ichiban and a character to the vocational school where you can take tests another mini game to increase ichibans personality traits

this is probably one of the best rpgs ive played and one of the most fun turn based combat systems ive played i really like how many skills have an input you can press to further boost the damage of itit makes you feel more involved during the combat and less like youre just sitting back and watching them play out the animations for the moves there are also plenty of ways to deal with either a single tough enemy or a large group of enemies ways to defeat them quickly or keep them from being able to hurt you on their turns i feel like most turn based rpgs lack that and it eventually feels like you slugging it out with the enemies as you both just stand there and tank blows until one of you cant anymore i like having options to essentially keep the enemyenemies from being able to harm me on their turns cause it makes it feel less like were all just standing around waiting to get hit and then waiting to hit them im not saying i dont ever want them to be able to hit me or take their turnsi just really like turn based combat games that give you a means to exploit the turn based system and avoid damage when its not your turn its why i loved those mario and luigi rpgs and their turn based combat it was not only interactive on your turns but on the enemys as well and there were means to avoidmitigate damage from their attacks there arent enough turn based combat games with systems or mechanics like that and while this one doesnt have prompts to avoidmitigate damage when its not your turn this game has other means to do so such as brainwashing or paralyzing enemies
with the next game in ichibans story coming out at the end of this month i wanted to get back into and finish the story of this one before i checked that out i dont know how necessary it would be to do so in order to understand the story of the next game but i figured it cant hurt and im loving getting back into this game and all its content if youve never  played a yakuza game and have no interest in them i still recommend checking this game out you might end up liking it as much as i have and find yourself checking out others in the series later on

#####

first let me say that this game has a couple issues

the biggest of all is that sega is just really not good at optimizing performance in their dragon engine games yakuza lad is the only game that makes my pc peak above 75c something not even cyberpunk 2077 at close to all ultra settings can admittedly that is a little disheartening in terms of accessibility for users with lower end pcs

the second issue is that this game has three entire cities but two are basically just glorified dungeon courtyards with absolutely nothing unique to them encounters are rare and all activities can be found in yokohama earlier no sidequests some story beats thats it a shame but one that can be remedied easily later

now let me say that this game is babsolute kinob in every aspect its frankly stunning that a game that made the transition to turn based jrpg at the last minute manages to be so good at everything a jrpg should be

 combat with very little tedium due to abundance of access to elements and aoe
 very easy grinding
 easy to manage character progression with simple catchup
 plenty of efficient moneymaking opportunities

everything jrpg in this game feels right neither too hard or too easy plenty of options that dont feel overwhelming either

the story is easily one of the best out of any yakuza game so far in fact having played 0 to 7 ill go so far as to say it has the bbest by farb  ichiban is an incredibly endearing protagonist that perfectly fits the yakuza universe in both its seriousness and silliness in equal measure the plot pacing is excellent and the story is extremely well told handling its fundamental themes of depression and societal alienation with finesse without shoving them in your face relentlessly

the entire cast is outright lovely in their differences and friendship and that alone carries the entire sotenbori segment in my opinion every character feels close enough to existing ones all while being their own thing all the same its a very delicate touch that lets veterans go from 6 to lad without feeling alienated but without comprimising the story too badly its very good

the soundtrack is extremely good as per yakuza standards and ranks very high on my list of favorites at the top between 5 and 04 for reference

visually the game is generally pretty appealing but suffers from the usual yakuza problem of extremely high res characters in low res environments and random low quality cgs after ingame rendered cutscenes which can be jarring but kudos for the lovingly crafted rendering of ichibans perm seriously this is the best hair ive seen in any game ever

finally in terms of voice acting its really good to have nishikiyamas voice actor back because he absolutely aces the performance im glad he was given a chance to be a protagonist because he has all the chops to handle it ichiban has incredible energy in every aspect and is a very fitting continuation of kurodas kiryu a breath of fresh air the series really needed and was handled perfectly

all in all this is a solid 910 with all the problems being negligible especially if you have a powerful pc if youre running on something a little old or weak you might want to upgrade first

#####

unironically my favorite yakuza game

#####

it took me a while to realize i dont like this game the change to a turn based rpg has made yakuza slow and annoying all the great writing and characters are there but the battle system is just a chore ill finish it cause im a completionist but i wish i wasnt

#####

ive been with the yakuza series ever since the very first entry back on the playstation 2 when first learning about yakuza like a dragon changing up the gameplay and introducing jrpg elements such as turnbased combat ill admit to thinking that this sounded like a terrible idea

when i finally tried the game out for myself it didnt really click with me at first i decided however to push on and give it a chance and im glad i did because a couple of chapters into the game i was hooked the turnbased combat is a lot of fun and the game commits fully to the jrpg idea even going so far as to have the characters in the game reference actual jrpgs such as dragon quest

the changes in gameplay isnt all thats new in like a dragon we also get a brand new protagonist in ichiban kasuga who turns out to be quite different from the previous series protagonist kazuma kiryu where kiryu is more stoic kasuga is a lot more outspoken and wears his heart on his sleeve this is a very welcome change that makes for far more interesting character interactions throughout the story of the game which mainly takes place in isezaki ijincho a location based on the yokohama district of isezakichō as someone who lived in yokohama for a time its a great to explore a location that feels familiar beyond that isezaki ijincho is a lot more open and sprawling compared to some of the locations weve seen before in the series like the mainstay kamurocho which feels a lot more dense and claustrophobic by comparison

all of these changes make like a dragon feel a bit like a fresh start for the series and a lot less daunting for someone whos not familiar with the series but that would like to get into it the previous games certainly arent forgotten about and throughout the story we do end up seeing several familiar faces from the past however like a dragon does stand on its own feet and should work very well as someones first yakuza game

the game certainly isnt without its flaws one of the most egregious being an incredibly steep difficulty curve in the later part of the game essentially ryu ga gotoku studio the developer of like a dragon has designed the game with the intention of having the player do a lot of the sidequests found throughout the game in a lot of games these kind of sidequests tend to be more of an optional thing that can mostly be ignored if one prefers to just follow the main story here however they are pretty much mandatory for being able to defeat some of the enemies and bosses towards the end of the game

while im not personally a fan of this approach to things it helps that many of the sidequests in like a dragon end up being a lot of fun there are also various minigames that can be enjoyed such as a trash collecting minigame which has kasuga riding around on a special bike collecting cans and a property management minigame which turns out to be essential for earning money theres even a mario kart knockoff minigame called dragon kart in true yakuza fashion its also possible to stop by gaming arcades to enjoy classic sega games such as outrun space harrier and virtua fighter

like a dragon ends up being a very lengthy game which will likely take most players around 6070 hours to complete of course a big reason for this is due to the previously mentioned approach that the developer decided to take more or less forcing the players to engage with all of the content thats available in the game i imagine this can be a big turnoff for some but if one is able to look past this then theres a lot of fun to be had with like a dragon and i would highly recommend giving it a chance

#####

i played persona 4 as well this year 2020 was good to me

#####

one of the most inspirational games ever

#####

like a dragon like a dragon

#####

the game is excellent in all aspects graphics gameplay story minigames humor etc which is why i recommend it to everyone the only downside may be the slow start  for the first three hours not much happens and the player is slowly introduced to the games world however we all know that sega doesnt offer refunds to players

in my opinion this is the best thing that could have happened to the yakuza series

#####

ichiban is legit and based af 

#####

ii love old meni



ih1yakuza like a dragon may be different than the rest of its titlesseries but the game itself is still enjoyable and awesome in its own unique wayh1i

the change from the ibeatem upi to iturnbased combati isnt all that bad to be frank i was also one of the players who didnt quite like the idea of this change when they first announce about the upcoming yakuza 7 back then it isnt because nah i prefer spamming buttons randomly instead of waiting turns iwhich i in fact do love a few good turnbased gamesi but ive always imagined it would feel weird throughout the whole game due to the changes somehow it turns out i can easily adapt to this new game playstyle within an hour personally if im not fond of a game i just wont be able to force myself to continue and here i am with at least 130 hours playtime recorded totally immersed into stories and minigames as well as lots of grinding characters level and money i absolutely love this game

story is very engaging and wellwritten humorous and good wholesome moments in between its hard not to love ichiban kasuga ithe main characteri and his group of friends there are some dark parts but not as much this game at start is using english audio by default so whoever prefers japaneses just like the previous games ion pc at leasti can head over to the settings and switch gorgeous graphics totally enjoyed walking around especially at night background music is pretty cool i liked the credits part sounds surprisingly fun and catchy plenty of jobs isimilarity to classes in rpgi for each character to choose from depending on players progress improving friendship with party members will benefit exp gains as well as a new skill at max bond level combat feels great its decent actually just one small dissatisfaction i get is when own party or enemy standing too far from each other they tend to run back and forth which results extra several seconds of time wasted each turn enemy designs are pretty unique some are jokes with quite amount of ridiculous names applies on most skills and effect too various of minigames available some are needed to be done at least once in a while to increase main characters personality status and money grind itll be slightly difficult to come across with great weapons and upgrades if one didnt play enough the business management minigame karaoke is fun as usual and ive got a favourite here adachis version on machinegun kiss the end was just clicks noice dragon kart minigame is interestingly fun too although some maps with narrow ways can be annoying when theyd just bump each other or sides numerous times and player might eventually get stuck in between too

overall the game is amazing not necessarily to play the prior games first as the main story in this one only has little connection to them of course for the best experience is to play them all than just one p 
very much recommended for both newcomers and yakuza series fan

#####

this game was a treat from start to finish as there was never any dullness in the story or gameplay when y7 was new people were iffy about the game direction in the series because when you think of yakuza you think of 3 things a brawlertype game an enticing story and you play as kazuma kiryu this game is a fullblown rpg with a new protagonist and it was very well done i played this for a month straight ignoring the other games i bought in my library at the time i purchased this until i finished it and it was wellworth it 
ichiban is wellwritten protagonist and his personality is the complete opposite of kiriyu not that its a bad thing but his cando attitude is what makes ichiban ichiban the other characters you play with are good as well the more you play with them the better you understand them and the bond between ichiban and his friends becomes stronger as they become more likable 

allinall this game is a solid 1010

this review will have spoilers so the tldr is that in my personal humble opinion this is the best yakuza game to date and its not remotely close i have loved every single yakuza game a lot so to say this is the best by a large margin is a huge compliment the developers took a massive chance with a new protagonist and a new gameplay loop and it paid off get it spoilers below

yakuza 7 was a refreshing journey away from kiryu if im honest despite enjoying yakuza 6 i dont think it shouldve existed kiryus story really felt like it ended in yakuza 5 that said ill admit i was skeptical of switching to a new protagonist after kiryu having seven games to connect to kiryu and the tojo clan made it feel like ichiban would be at a disadvantage little did i know that less than half way through the game id be more invested in ichiban then i was with kiryu the earnest good natured enthusiasm of ichiban is just infectious the game lampshading that ichibans love for dragon quest is why the game is turn based that the game warps due to his imagination its all such good characterization and i felt invested in ichibans struggle ichibans story is a story of perpetual hope and yet hes also very clearly an abuse victim kept distant from the only family he has treated always as lesser and yet always loyal to the very end ichiban is loyal the fact that hes survived so long as a victim of emotional abuse from both masato and masumi and never let that once break his spirit break who he is as a person that through everything he remained idealistic hopeful and kind god damn it hit harder than any other game i played in a long while

h1meet the crewh1
kiryu on crack hes not a virgin this time
buffed tanimura he also got old and has a son
an homeless person go buy a house duh
walmart grade majima has two eyes
your average korean step on me pls
female protagonist 1 spoilerwomenspoiler
female protagonist 2 literally has no cutscenes in the main story  spoilerwomenspoiler

jokes aside before i played the game i thought a turn based yakuza wouldnt satisfy my monkey brain and boy i was wrong big time the main story is just fluent and gripping like most of the other yakuza games ichiban goes through stuff that kiryu has gone through yakuza kiwami but it felt different this time instead of kiryu ichiban isnt scared of showing his emotions to the world and this is what sets apart ichiban from kiryu

the combat is actually fun and innovative you get to learn so many different and unique skills throughout the game theres so many stuff to explore and jobs to explore every job comes with its unique weapons outfits skills you can synergise these jobs to make a good performing crew to fight jrpg people in ichibans head there are bosses and characters from older yakuza games and they sure do kick your ass while youre banging your head over the absolute fresh soundtrack that is so good for a turnbased game if youre not grinding for 100 completion grinding is just as boring and repetitive as other rpgs the combat is very fun and doesnt make you miss the nonturn based combat

dont make me talk about the substories and side activities from a monkey using an excavator to a giant roomba that sucks people this game offers a wide wariety of charades that will satisfy the most unfunny person me
