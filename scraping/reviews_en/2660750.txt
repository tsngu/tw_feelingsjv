teku is a calming game based on reaching a score in order to move onto the next level as usual as the levels proceed the difficulty increases adding more rules and more tiles i highly recommend this game install it now

teku is calming until you play it enough

btekub is one of the many urlhttpssteamcommunitycomiddohi64recommended1046030islandersurllikes the common hexbased variety for free this time which is less common place tiles strategically for maximum points until you screw up or run out game over well done try again

b2 game modesb are available in uclassicu theres a limited number of tiles gotta place them all to finish but only a few placement options are offered for each uchallengeu unlocks more tiles as you gain more points and they can be placed anywhere as long as they touch another tile so thats in fact the classic and less challenging gameplay they couldve thought more about the names and shouldve explained modes on level select ibeforei starting one not only through tutorial messages and on the store page

b5 locations with 5 levels eachb only the first location and all its contents are unlocked at the start stars open the rest awarded for reaching a set amount of points in both modes so 2 stars per stage 10 per location bspecial rulesb are applied sometimes like a certain tile or having two separate islands granting more points placing something creating two instances to maintain symmetry and even gravity affecting placed stuff these are neat btiles are randomizedb as one would expect so theres some replayability both for fun and due to rng messing things up

simple but good enough pixel graphics tooltips on mouseover but they can bug out and remain onscreen after a level ends or while playing bonly dragging works cant click to pick up click to placeb not very accessible nor does it work flawlessly which can cause problems in classic mode with limited placement options and big hitboxes its easy to accidentally put something in the wrong place and bno undob makes it even more frustrating but levels dont last long so it just about gets a pass

speaking of accessibility theres ba choice of fonts for better readabilityb and mouse wheel also works on level select so the dev isnt totally oblivious like many others yet theres no back button on some screens just lazily click anywhere to escape bno midlevel savingb would be an immediate dealbreaker but not the most annoying thing in this case still no reason not to save whenever the player wants or has to quit

only a single volume setting but theres no music so its fine multiple profiles so more than one person can compete on the bonline leaderboardsb from one pc there are a couple of languages and toggles for always showing the score on tiles and the grid otherwise its hard to tell where the level ends mouseovering the progress bar or score display does the same would be good to have an onscreen tile score toggle going back to the menu to change it is too tedious

and again on the flipside bthe full screen toggles is buggedb i could only run the game in a window restarting and editing the config file proved to be fruitless as well then after a few levels it suddenly started working when i tried it one more time bdoesnt run on win7 either despite the minimum requirements stated on the store pageb shouldnt be an issue for most but come on

bi liked the various rules mixing things up and found the whole thing a lot more difficult than expectedb took some doing to unlock the 4th level pack and didnt have the patience to keep trying for the last let alone all the stars feels like babsolute perfection is necessary for the star on many levelsb which is a bit much when everything relies on rng so depending on luck and patience it can entertainfrustrate for a while or longer

free is free but its not an automatic pass and while this one could also use more work its okay overall with a tiny bit of postrelease support it couldve been a stronger recommendation

good game gets a bit annoying thou with the amount of rng later on but fun overall

a little too rng to enjoy playing this on steam could pass the time away on my phone though

the usual lets waste your time random spawn puzzle game  so sick of this stuff being spammed seems to show what a lack of decent gaming gets made these days

#####

fantastic little puzzle game caw caw

but once you start having to manage volcanoes and cities at the same time you start to feel a bit retarded caw caw

#####

fun relaxed game 

#####

you should play this

#####

сомнительно ну окей

#####

cool little game that is worth your time to explore especially if you like games like islanders or dorfromantic much simpler version of those too great games but same concept 

the rng can get a little frustrating as sometimes you just dont get the tiles you need to score enough points to earn your star but it unlocks levels far enough out that you dont need to get all the stars to experience each levelzone 

awesome addition to the library and even better that its free 

fyi  this will run on steam deck too if you adjust the capability properties 

thanks for the gem that will travel

i love how calming this game is it is awesome its so good im surprised its free its such a big game with so much content

#####

a fun short game with a nice art style and satisfying sound effects

it reminds me a lot of a similar game called islanders as youre provided with tiles and logically playing similar tiles next to eachother gives you more points its intuitive a big forest wants to go next to a little forest a mountain near a hill the challenges stay fairly consistent and the difficulty progresses with your game knowledge

there is a little rng involved later as hitting some of the more valuable tiles repeatedly makes it much easier to accomplish levels and i wish that there was a way to review your map at the end of a level so you can see which tiles earned you the most points and which didnt have muich effect it would help learn from your mistakes another improvement id love to see is some kind of way to preview the edge of the map so you can plan out your tiles or simply removing the edge

but for a free game it was definitely enjoyable to play for a few hours i managed to get a few good scores and place second of all players and others not so high but it was all accomplishable with a little patience

#####
