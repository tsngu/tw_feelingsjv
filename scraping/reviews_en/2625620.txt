to be fair i like the game but after putting in a few days of grinding making money to finally buy my shop so i can transition to a real business the game froze when i went to sleep one night i lost all my progress for the last couple days no big deal right i shrugged it off took a break came back the next night and did it again and it froze when i went to sleep i verified game files nothing so all my progress gone so no right now i cant recommend this game because its not quite done yet when it is then i will

#####

good game but really needs a reset car button because getting stuck

#####

need support for 3440x1440p cant use my monitor or see the computer screen at market without changing to 1920x1080 on my ultrawide monitor

#####

i have followed this game for a while not long after it was announced on steam i have played for over two hours and so far have like it now there is still work to be done more that can be added but as it just released to day on early access im impressed from the game play so far its a game where you buy storage units and sell whats in the unit but from what the road map shows there more to come to the game give it a try always worth a shot

#####

if its not bolted down i will sell it

#####

as things stand i cant recommend this game  it is very addictive and enjoyable but its very much at time of writing this a game requiring fleshing out it feels  unless it goes on 40 sale

vehicle controls feel like they need a little tweaking  hit boxes of items need complete overhaul found an unfolding four legged camping table  hey why not just put it in the pickup upside down and i can put more items on top  of nevermind it has a solid cube hit box  trying to tuck that bike into the side  nope handlebars stick out at the top so thats a solid rectangle hit box  frustrating

one to keep an eye on for sure

#####

honestly the game is pretty cool its very addicting and an interesting concept now yes i would recommend the game but not in its current state i cant count how many times i lost items trying to move them even get them out of the truck for some reason they just disappear when using the free move or q key i also have a surplus of stuff to sell stuck on the roof of my store they just go flying when you try to put them down lol i also dont understand why they dont have a unstuck button for you or your vehicles yet its an early access game like come on crap happens and you get stuck so put an unstuck button 3 times i had to walk to sell and rebuy my vehicle just to fix the problem i gave up on the game the 4th time i got stuck i would love to play more its just to buggy rn

#####

even in early access i give this game a solid 45 of 5 stars for content and play ability
all ages friendly safe for young children yet fun for adults decent sized map with open world driving and exploration the concept is easy to understand nice detail on vehicles and props the missions and tasks are fun and you will earn skills and  in the game to buy some sweet well deserved rewards realestate vehicles etc i have easily gotten my s worth out of this game already and excitedly anticipate future updates keep up the great work

#####

lots of work to be done but what sets this apart from other games like this is the correct selection of vehicles they actually used american style tractors and trailers and vans that would make sense in the game lots of devs dont know the difference between european trucks  trailers and american and what we usually get is a gross and off putting mix between the two this one gets it all right using all american style and a nice variety too for this type of game also even in this early state what is there works pretty well but this must be updated and added to so the game is worth playing longer overall it has good potential

#####

its very very addictive

#####

more i play it the more i hate it lol 
fix the motors everything about them is just jank 
the shops a waste of time unless you just want the auctions 
controls in general are janky 
game is just grindy and boring after a while 
save your money and buy something else 


#####

let me say this first i like the direction the game is going however there are some improvements that are desperately needed among those are a full size map and better handling of the vehicles those should be fixed first and foremost the next thing is the physics there are some wonky things happening here other things that need to be addressed are the character models they are just plain hideous especially the very angry karens that bull rush your table to buy something i may have nightmares the animations fall in the same category they are stiff and not very natural looking as of the writing of this review this game is jjjjjjanky but its the right kind of jank the vehicle models are pretty great and the scenery is done decently even though a bit cookie cutter and square i have played a few other games of the same genre here on steam and each one does some things right and some things wrong but if one of them ever gets all the right boxes ticked they will be a clear winner bottom line i will not be refunding this and will continue to play as long as updates are continuously rolling in

#####

i can no longer save my game data or access any save data on this game its lame

#####

great game almost feels like storage wars

#####

i like this game i think its fun

#####

good potential i enjoy playing how ever i 8 hour mark game runs smooth there were a couple bugs but all good now addicted

#####

hmmm not sure how i feel about this one i am at the refund now or never stage and i think i have decided to not refund because it didnt cost much and there is a solid game to be had but i cannot recommend this in its current state my issues with this game are most likely attributed to it being in early access very early access with very limited assets that are highly reused you will see the same person walking next to themselves as an example the graphics are mostly trash at this point not sure if that will change but the models are lowres outdated junk afaik i am an ea warrior and love indie simulators and put a lot of hours into them so that is not the issue almost everything i read in negative reviews is true especially about the horrendous driving experience with the exception being that i have not had any game breaking issues or game crashes except i did get my truck stuck on a hill and had to reload a save because there is no other way to get unstuck anyway the bones are there and the game is kind of playable but this is not ready for public consumption imo  it is at a stage more appropriate to a closedalpha ill check back in a few months

#####

the game idea is brilliant but the glitches make the game so unenjoyable at times second time ive spent 7000 on some storage units and loaded the box truck drove to the caravan to sleep and save to wake to find the whole of my box van empty the first time it happen i lost a 7000 dollar rife that i found this time 3x 1000 dollar bicycles and a load of other valuable items

shame but i think the best way ahead is to uninstall the game and wait a few years then these types of bugs might be fixed and the game could be playable again

#####

does it have issues yes but for the price i find the game very playable if youre into simulator games this is one of the better low budget ones out there extremely fun and with room to grow if the developer continues to update this game i can see myself playing this game for hours and hours beyond what i have already put in

cons some features dont work like fueling your vehicle some building assets just dont do anything but exist also the spacing between points of interest can be cumbersome but once you find your routine in the game its not an issue the problem with finding your routine is then you really arent using the rest of the map i wish there was a bit more in the realms of cost of warehouse to items received right now you can just buy the cheapest warehouses to maximize profits

all in all super fun i will continue to play with hopes of updates it exceeds expectations given the price

#####

this is great game and i can not stop playing

#####

wide resolution is broken making the game unplayable and the game devs apparently have no plans on fixing this soon

will be refunded

#####

its a grind but its a fun game it will keep you wanting to keep upgrading the only thing i wish it had was controller support i know its early access but still pick it up if you enjoy simulator games

#####

needs to be more controller friendly cant rotate items in hand only with mouse cant drive with r2 as gas pedal driving is all in left stick terrible design when it comes to button layout on controller using a one way highway system when driving is also terrible have to drive into traffic or drive 40 mins out of your way to turn around in game goals also need to be improved buy a shop vehicles for transport and buy a house why no trailers for the pick up truck or even delivery options for goods that arent worth our time to haul    i would recommend to simulator fans but know its a basic game on early launch hopefully they continue to improve the in game goals as well as friendliness to the players

#####

got this as it looked like a nice little storage wars type game as it is now i cant really recommend this game even as an early access title it feels unpolished and kinda rushed

h3big turn offsh3
no large mapno large map that is easily accessible so the minimap is likely the only help you will get in trying to get anywhere tried to look for the map button and couldnt find one

no key mapping

has a brokenneeds repair system and just doesnt tell you anything about it

icons of different things in the distance dont seem to go away and are also different colours but wont tell you what those colours mean

the map is weird to say the least in that i find myself just going along the wrong side of the road 90 of the time as it feels easier to get to places the map will also just abruptly stop in the form of an invisible wall while the npc cars will continue on down the road  some indication that this will happen would be nice

no female player option  just irks me in games

h3little turn offsh3
some broken english  things like close and not closed the customer wont come because its too late  the use of the word warehouse or garage when they mean storage unit

the vehicle graphics are pretty good and the buildings are fine but the npcs barely look better than something from hl1

fps is fairly inconsistent unless you turn down the graphics which i tend not to do and am fine with in other games

on making a new save it will say that all saved progress will be lost even though it wont be

pausing doesnt pause the game  driving while pausing wont lock the camera until you mouse over the black banner of the pause screen

the cars are done really weirdly i havent played with a game that really shows a cars suspension as well as this and speeding really does feel dangerous until you figure out if you hit a railing at 150 kmh it just brings you to a dead stop or turns you and drifts you backwards like 3 feet and nothing will fly out of the back of your truck flipping your truck will also not throw anything out of your truck

there is a leaning option to make your character lean left or right like in rainbow six siege and such games which feels so out of place it in itself wouldnt be a bad thing but as leaning is y for left and x for right it just feels like they added it to see if they could and then forgot about it as its on completely opposite sides of the keyboard

weekly payments on bank loans are every 12 days i mean if you want to make loans less invasive just lower the amount of money you have to pay back not increase the number of days you have to pay it back in if youre giving it a name which itself is a time limit

lastly the current tutorial is very much tell dont show which feels weird especially as some of the content is missing from what is pretty much just a powerpoint of how to play the game

i think it could be a genuinely enjoyable experience once it can actually effectively tell you where youre going and how to get there

#####

thus far i only have 3 hours in and i can tell you im hooked  it is a very chill relaxing game that offers a lot more fun then people might initially think  ive seen a lot of comparisons to storage wars and while there is a slight storage wars element the primary focus of dealer sim is well making deals with people  

on that same note i was taken off guard by how realistic the potential customers acted for example you can have a 1k priced item and twothree customers will try and buy it for 300 or somewhere in that margin  they wont budge from that price they want it for cheap  then the next customer could come and take it for full price  somehow dealer sim has mastered the art of cheapskate ai and i love it

with this being in ea bugs and issues are to be expected and currently there are a few  the main issue for me is lack of optimization the most fps i get is in the teens and this is on all low settings with the exception of textures texture setting has to be medium for you to properly play this game

another issue is the ai traffic  traffic does not care what so ever that you exist they will happy hit you without so much as slowing down  again im sure this will be improved on over time but i still wanted to mention it

in addition to ai traffic if you get in a crash the ai you collided with despawns  eventually i hope this turns into a reaction where the ai stop wait for you to move and then keep on going the ai despawning instantly is a little offputting

a final gripe which is more on the smallnit pick side the developer made the map in a way where you are severely punished if you take a short cut off road  i experienced this as did a streamer  it would have been nice if the dev hadnt shortcut proofed the map

in all i am very addicted to this game and will waste so much time in it

#####

cant get pass tutorial screen

#####

i liked it until i lost all my progress and now unable to save any game progress  for now dont buy wait until they fix all bugs

#####

this game is great fun i love these types of games bare in mind this game is early access so there are bugs here and there but nothing game breaking i have made a series on youtube you can check out here for gameplay httpsyoutubecomplaylistlistplpihuttbloouhurvap0lg8mtsqbtqdorbsidijumu0tcjhqgm3f

my only real negative is the main road on the map which is a motorway with barrier so spend most my time on the wrong side of the road id prefere see more roundabout junctions on a smaller road i think

#####

i currently have 61 hours on this game after getting it last month i have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game it brings me back to my childhood of watching storage wars with my father and i love the auctions too it has a nice variety of items in the game as well so you are not always going to get the same items in each unit that you buy it is a gamble with the units you may lose money on some but make thousands on others highly recommended 5 stars

#####

i really liked that game this just early access and still look good to me because of team dev id working so hard and new adding for item vehicle ai working delivery buying storage and item reselling graphic look good and i just make a list for feedbacksuggestion and i am sure they will improve this game as soon

#####

its a great game overall

#####

im hooked very good game

#####

i will admit that the game can be fun and addictive however there are a number of reasons that i just cant recommend it in its current state  the biggest challenge is spending so much time trying to purchase the shop to just have all the customers behave the same way coming in and offering next to nothing and refusing to accept a reasonable price  hitboxes need to be reduced some and the physics needs help  nothing like picking up one item and have it fling another halfway to mars

#####

i played for 10 hours and i can say  its not a fun game its a complete mess when purchased gadgets disappear set prices get mixed up and disappear the game itself crashes regularly the first car fits more gadgets than the much more expensive next one van the car slides off the road and gets stuck while driving then you need to restart the game and start the morning clearly  the map and the game world are idiotically spread out and too big for a beta game the suggested prices of goods are not always adequate as a result of which after a long time of suffering and getting nervous to the ceiling the game has to be turned off the game has a lot of additional absurd activities the developer could have invested that time in the main game instead
  this game is a bad and cheap copy of another similar game identical to storage hustle this game only partially lives up to its name i am completely dissatisfied and i think it is a scam at this moment i do not recommend buying it because you will be disappointed well the future will show whether this is not an ordinary fraud in order to make money maybe he will improve it for half a year and then he will forget and leave it incomplete personally i would be ashamed to put such a game on the market and even more so to ask for money for it this initial version should be free but later if the developers make an effort  then they will earn their money i do not recommend deleted

#####

the game lets you go in the main menu but once you try to load the game it crashes i didnt pay 2069 just for the game not to work i tried validating files it did not work i tried uninstalling the game and installing it again and it did not work i did realise though that every time i i try to play it messes up a file just one single file like honestly might just get a refund if i can it has been 10 minutes now that i have been trying to play now please fix this it looks like they dont want me posting this because it has been 7 times now that i press the post review button so im starting to get pissed off please fix this

#####

barely a tutorial in how to play the game after i place items up for sale at the market im been waiting for customers to show yet nothing happens managed to get 2 customers in the space of 8 minutes

#####

the trading mechanic seems passable but the driving is atrocious

if it were something more instance based like some of the other games of this genre on the market this would be alright

as it stands i dont want to drive that damn pickup anywhere

also get that its ea but the game ui doesnt support ultrawide and is also just generally unpolished the map gets cut off unless i set to a 169 resolution which then gets the black bars

#####

its a little janky and needs a lot polish but theres something fun and relaxing about it looking forward to updates and qol fixes 

for the price its worth checking out just keep expectations low for now

#####

rubbish  not fun menu not responsive i requested a refund within 30 min  save your money

#####

this would be a good game for me  but ill wait for more bug fixes 1 ive tried to change the setting too many times never saves it    2 the truck is all over the place its hard to keep it on the road and to stop it spinning outits making me dizzy and the 3rd reason which is why im not happy spent the last hour buying warehouses loaded my truck crashed my truck 3 times finally  got to the market the game crashed so what i did in the last hour never happened so save it save it

#####

play the  15 hours but the save does not save at all

#####

not sure if anyones found a workaround yet but moving shelves after initial placement in your shop should be a thing if its already there i cant figure it out accidentally placed a 3 shelf unit in a walkway and cant revertmove it might need to be addressed if it should be movable or im missing something

#####

i never really write reviews but this game has really annoyed me 

i understand its early access but i dont feel this is even ready for that after less than 20 mins of game play i have found it impossible to actually play these are the reasons
1 the tutorial is a few little boxes of writing before you start playing after this it gives you some kind of tutorial objectives but with absolutely no explanations it was impossible to complete even the second one where as most games explain in a tutorial what to do usually telling you which key to press or where to go etc or why this does neither it is not straight forward at all on what to do meaning its pretty much unplayable in my opinion
2 there is no list of controls at all of guidance on what they are  not even in the options menu to try and get out the car i had to literally sit here and press every key on my keyboard until i found the right one
3 the map is so poorly created and missing simple things like identifying your owned warehouse that its useless

i see it is listed as mostly positive 27 reviews total at time of writing but if you read these most are actually negative and others seem very similar and very unauthentic 

if you look at my profile you will see that i have played many simulatortycoon games many in ea i have played some i didnt think that much of but to date this is the one i am most disappointed in

definitely requesting a refund

#####

this is a really great early access game having a lot of fun playing it give it a try 

#####

this game runs like hot garbage go buy supermarket sim

#####

after playing for 11 hours i would definitely recommend this game always had something to do granted youre doing the same thing repeatedly other than doing cargo missions its fun seeing the different items you might get

the game does have bugs that need fixing and maybe some things added
fixes
search employee has turkish text when the game is in english settings along with placing store items such as the bed tables and shelves 
buying tables and what not for store should be reworded to buy instead of usei bought 6 beds and cant sell them now lol so i got boxes laying around 
pull up map option or remove it since the place locations are constantly up
vehicle torque and handling should be tweaked and maybe a different sound for the cargo trucks
little more information on the tutorial still after 11 hours cant figure out how to junk items and then use them to repair other items i just did the normal repair 

these are just a few things id address first and then maybe get a house since its not in the game yet so im not having to sleep in my bed at my store 

great game so far looking forward to the updates


#####

briliant concept of a game with poor execution  got stuck in my truck common issue and refunded as id have had to completely start over it does not save progress

#####

a lot of things do not work

#####

this game is boarderline unplayable i have the car auction update and now the game wont let me into my shop the doors stay closed weather i select open or closed and it still lets the npcs enter

#####

it would be good if you can sell books and magazines and you can buy the house and your first shop for cheap

as a youtuber this is a great game as well for personal i love this game and so do my viewers do why not check out my youtube channel and subscribe timsgaminglive

#####

the game in its current state is pretty unplayable what i mean is that there is currently an issue where you have to use the computer to price things before you sell them but the resolution on the computer monitor in the game is enlarged so you cant do much with it they said you can reset your own computer resolution and it will fix it in the game but that hasnt worked for myself and many others its kind of an integral piece of the puzzle

the game as low budget as it is has potential but the gameplay basics need to be there for it to be playable otherwise it just sits in my library until someone cares enough about the customersplayers to fix it

rating it a 210 just because of the inability to play it ill update it if and when they fix it

#####

had trouble at the start because the game didnt work on my pc hopefully that will be fixed
but im using a different pc and the game works i have been playing dealer simulator now for a couple of weeks now and i am loving the game all the items there is the way the game has been designed also the devs listen to all the comments also they are all helpful 
great game

#####

bought my first warehouse cannot find out how to change your furniture around after dropping them in place please help

#####

its very addictive for certain people but god damn is it annoying i advise not spending money on this game in its current state things will be catapulted accross the map just picking them up or putting them down entire storage contents will despawn from shop after loading a save cars spin wheels as if you were driving on ice barganing system is very rudamentary storage of inventory in the shop is a nightmare no customer queues mean a tedious selling cycle i did spend money for the game so i made sure to squeeze all the entertainment i could from it but the bugs make me angry far too often it is a good concept but the execution is very poor

#####

needs a lot of work  driving mechanics are getting better there is no saving the progress youve made in the game without doing a series of steps instead of just fixing it  should have waited until update 80 to release very frustrating game at this current stage

#####

this game is so addictingis like a mashup up of storage wars and flea marketswap shop simulator still in early access it definitely has its bugs but the devs are very responsive in their discord

as of today march 22nd it seems the devs are more concerned about adding new content than fixing their game this saddens me because i still love the game but it is so broken that i can no longer enjoy playing it

#####

this game still has potential but im put off by a number of things first of all my gaming laptop doesnt seem to be powerful enough for this elite highgraphics game my screen gets real shaky after about a minute of playing i cannot play for more than 20 minutes for the most part but lets talk about gameplay a bit why do we wake up so late especially starting off at the small markets youd think wed be there by sunrise or shortly afterwards and youd think wed have boxes or containers to put the small items in to take to our vehicle even worse we dont even stack game or movie dvds and have to pick them up onebyone the flashlight is useless it shines on nothing in the back of the truck big items can take an hour to get through doors the controls are awkward but i am thankful i can pick up three items at a time theres no tutorial what does the green number mean wholesale id like to be able to pick a popular item and price is slightly over the retail but nobody buys theres so many things wrong but if i see some progress and fixes made ill edit my review to a better one

#####

the ui in the game makes it unplayable and there is no way to fix it in settings


#####

good game just bugs here and there as expected for a early access

#####

i just got this game and am already really enjoying it i like telling the customers who lowball me to get out of my face can we please get some headlights for the truck though im out here using telephone poles as brakes during the night

edit found the brakes and headlights l for headlights space for brakes would be nice if this information was shown on the screen when driving im like 7 hours in and just figured it out lol

#####

i have hope in the devs good concept good luck improving the game still got issues but i understand its in early access sadly not everyone understands that

#####

i played this game for more than 20 hours and i am a big fan of storage wars so i enjoyed this game a lot you will learn the skills of bargaining and doing business
i also did a live stream on my youtube channel httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvignrdrck1u
the game developer also actively worked on game updates and promptly fixed bugs
i recommend you guys try this game and give your honest feedback on the stream also do check my gameplay on youtube tv_gaming_official

#####

do not waste your money yet

its a great concept but to easy to cheat

auction cheat
jobs cheat
just editing the files cheat

once you realise how easy it is to cheat the fun and enjoyment quickly disappears

not to mention the multitude of bugs items disappearing through the groundwalls and even when walking by recycle bins losing thousands

with each new update a new cheat seems to come to light it kinda took the wind out of my sails with this awesome concept

so hold off buying until these issues are addressed in the future hopefully

this was how much fun i was having until i realised how easy it is to cheat

#####

would be nice if i could even play it says press any key then crash

#####

yes

#####

hi


#####

cant go fullsceen

#####

i bought everything i have 15 million what now  the game is over damn it 

#####

this game is trash when driving you randomly start floating get stuck and theres no button to unstuck a vehicle only way round it load up a previous save and repeat yourself for this bug infested excuse of a game dont even think of wasting money on this trash

#####

so far i am enjoying this game its still in early access so still lots of issues to work out but for the price its a deal i seen early access games for twice the price with just as much work needed from what i see on discord the developer is aware of issues and is fixing them so a bit of patience is recommended as long as the developer keeps updating and fixing issues its worth adding to your game list

#####

good game i like it keep up the good work

#####

its the start of early access for dealer simulator so for what there is in it its pretty good although its a bit of a grind
the driving is fun though just watch yourself when you try to take shortcuts some of them work really nicely but then there are some where i got stuck and had to abandon the delivery there is one car in the game that really moves lightening fast but if youre not really all that much into driving you can place your vehicles at strategic spots around the map so you can teleport there any time it saves me a ton of time that way

#####

great game good graphics great details and challenging highly recommend cant wait for updates my biggest issue is the bugs but so far ive only found 2 which is good for a game this early in development i would also like to ask the developers to add more houses and shop options and maybe make the world larger but i have my hopes that this will be one of the great simulator masterpieces like gas station simulator

#####

game does not load past new game crashes when i press any button have verified files still not fixed

#####

i really like this game but my game keeps bugging out where i cannot buy anything from the auction i have tried to reset the game save several times if this is fixed i will return to the game

#####

i wanted to like this game but after finally buying my first shop and saving money to fill it i bought 2 lockers each had a gun case and gaming stuff along with jewelry i saved after putting it all in my van and saved after filling my shop before getting off for the night i got on the next day and my shop was empty i tried going back to the previous save and my van was empty now i have no stock and all the money i saved up is gone also

#####

really good game

#####

great game so far would like to see more options for furniture be able to put sell points outside maybe have liquidation pallets for purchase

#####

very fun grindy but good i wish auction day was every day theres quite a few bugs but nothing i couldnt handle

#####

pretty fun game

#####

game bugged after newest update cant even price items had other minors bugs but unplayable now until a fix sucks having fun definitely fun for cost of game had several game breaking bugs before leaving this review  but they have been fixed till now support also dont reply so dont even try that

#####

fun game its got bugs but its in alpha so thats normal would like to see some minor change like a loading dock for the big shop so that you dont have to bring everything trought a single door and just dump the truck by the garage door abd some other things

#####

i love the premise of the game i think its brilliant and really something different however this game is unplayable if i save and shut down the game when i reload it my vantruck is unable to move this means to get anything i have in the back to the market i have to unload it  run to the dealership and get another van  reload and then can go off again this is very time consuming very annoying and inconvenient and its made me just unable to enjoy the game ill update this review ifwhen it is fixed disappointing

#####

the game is getting better and has growing pains but that is to be expected  i cant wait to see this game get better

#####

after 102 hours i recommend game game is good but i would like see some thing like auction for storage more stuff for sell maybe good thing is add guy which help with truck unload when you buy a lot storage you need about 1 hour in real life for unload

#####

i would recommand this game very fun and addictive 5 stars

#####

fun casual game to play while listening to music needs a bit of polishing but the devs are very active and bring new content often looking forward to the new content they will being adding in the near future

#####

i really think this game is a gem it is endless fun and the development team seems to always care and continuing to work on improving the game theres always going to be bugs glitches mishaps etc but it is in early access still hopefully theres a lot to come with this game itd be great to see a early supporters dlc or something in the future i do highly recommend this game if you are wanting something different to play 710 in my opinion thus far  will change after few updates i think

#####

game needs more driving development because my truck keeps randomly flipping over and im losing all my stuff when this happens


#####

very good game i do like it a lot definitely interesting there are a few bugs sometimes the vehicles will not go over 20 to 30 mph it happens randomly and at the auction i cannot pick up any of my winnings they get stuck you cannot do anything about it if you do anything they disappear

#####

very good

#####

love it

#####

great game  only have had a few minor issues with it like with the latest update the box truck #2 that i had loaded up sitting at my shop would not move so no other choice but to restart the map but that was fine it gave me a chance to fix some goof ups i had made  it would be awesome that for the storage totes that you can find in the storage unit it would be nice to have the option to keep them to transport the smaller items that we get also a better shelf that could hold onto the games dvds or even the ability to hang the pictures on the walls just an idea

#####

love the game its super fun just very buggy but thats kinda expected with games like this sill in the making id  definitely recommend this game to those who enjoy a open world type simulator theres tons to do n lot of different items to work up including different shops n cars and trucks pulse side jobs for when your running low on money

#####

you can not get past the loading screen on the main menu

#####

love it

#####

love the game

#####

lost a save which i put 14 hours in to why cloud save is not a thing on this gamethe game is janky to say the least and you need spend good while to configure control layout on steam deck to play

#####

i start playing this game dealer simulator  and now i am  addicted to the game  make more money built my business bigger i have 138 h in the game and  lots more coming love this game a big thanks you to the developer of the game

#####

another instance where a jank game has super cleaned up screens but barely functions much less plays correctly it manages to actually look worse than asset flipy simulator games

#####

great game ive been wanting a game like this for ages i love how you start out as a small market stall trader then can progress into more business opportunitys although i wish we could keep the market stall after buying a shop just for when im in the mood to run a market stall

the updates ive seen so far have been great and the dev seems to respond quickly to people the vehicle interiors of the vans could be abit nicer but im sure that could be polished in the future as its not a game breaker

#####

im not sure whats up with all the negative reviews the game is legit fun to play very addicting the assets are very good the game loop isnt too easy but also not to grindy you can actually get lucky or miss out like in real life theyre updating and adding stuff constantly def a rec from me

#####

its a good game

but i have only save problem i can only play to day 10 then save disapears

i will start play this again after they fix it

#####

there is an error with the discord link everytime i go to click it it tells me that it is an invalid invite i really wanna join the server but cant pls try and fix that also my truck is stuck on the selling plot and i cant get it off pls fix this soon

#####

its a great game to play and enjoy and it keeps improving recommenced

#####

great game to pass time if your looking for something thatll drag u in takes some grinding time to get a store unless u pull a loan but it still afun game and i cant wait to see what gets added in next

#####

loving the game if yall could add it to be a multiplayer like 2 player game no more than 2 that would be dope both players have separate banks or even the same bank they could team up and run a store or even run separate stores i dont know the idea is there good job on the game though

#####

yes yes very fun 


#####

great game with awesome potential to all who are here from jeff favignano it is worth it haha
completely worth the price
got storage wars vibes to it oddly addicting

#####

loads up but wen u click new game it goes bck to steam web site

#####

i have started over 3 times now and every time i go back in to play it my saved game is lost so i have to start over this is bullshit fix the fucking game

#####

i like it but it has bugs objects are disappearing and i cant bring the objects to the tables because they disappear i hope these get fixed

#####

good game need some update to add more stuff

#####

i like games like this the fun treasure hunt of whats in the next box so i forgave a lot of issues with this game unrecoverable vehicles trucks suddenly breaking and not going over a top speed of 30 mph and no way to fix it but selling and rebuying a new truck horrible physics where you will lose things to space because you picked up the dvd under the rc car the most cutpaste npcs and things glitching through the world all the time the last straw was loading up a large panel truck with 4 lockers worth of goods and saving the game but when i loaded back in all of it was gone i really wanted to like this game and hope that the developer takes it down to work on it instead of just barely patching it this game is a dumpster fire that needs to be dropped in the ocean not doused with cups of water

#####

started off good making money did the sidejobs saved enough for a store and thats kinda it nothing else do really do not enough new content to keep playing but maybe in the future

#####

this game is nothing special the npcs walk and look strange sometimes when i hit a car my truck gets spun around like a rag doll some items are bugged and you cannot sell them sometimes the items launch into the air and cannot be found

#####

this game has great potential i bought it as an investment because i can see the passion that the developer has and i hope they will continue to improve it it has a long way to go but its already in a fun playable state if you can get around the few quirks that it has 
so if you like this type of games i would recommend buying it before the popularity and price goes up to support the development and save some money

#####

great game 
what i like about the game is that it feel like your playing your own version of storage wars

#####

this is a good game that devs take advice from the people that play it

#####

i love addictive games like this but i cant pay full price then play it with the stress overhanging my head the whole time that my next truckload of product is suddenly going to disappear like it has twice in 8 hours of gameplay


#####

just got the game after 17 min of playing it froze and i forced shut it now i have it on fullscreen but its windowed cant even change the options couse canceling reseting and applying is all x on the controller i cant even see it when i am in the options couse its cut off oh and btw the discord link is invalid

#####

im really enjoying this game it is one of those chill listen to music and grab a beer type game yeah there are a few bugs and if your truck flips over you will have to reload your last save my advice dont drive like an idiot and you should be fine

there are a lot of negative reviews on this game but for the price and the fun that im having i honestly dont care they are annoying but not game breaking

the main thing i wish the dev would implement is a reset on vehicles if they do turn over plenty of games that have that option so im sure he can figure it out

other things that need to be fixed

physics on items and vehicles
items lost in the ground
saves being more reliable sleeping saves seem fine so far

ive just saved enough to buy a shop so if there are bugs with that part of the game then maybe ill come back and update this i do know the dev updates often so im sure fixes are on the way

#####

this game is so addicting easy and fun what makes it even better you have consistent prompts on what to push so its very friendly to those who have a slower processing mind like myself highly recommend i am excited to see where this game goes

#####

excellent loop plays well on deck with a few controller tweaks  by no means a aaa experience but neither is the price highly recommend to people who enjoy games like powerwash sim

#####

 i paid for and downloaded this game yesterday and i was wondering if there was a secret to be able to play it i click new game and it loads and then when  i press any key it goes black and then crashes nothing loads and it closes out and freezes my computer 

i have started it over multiple times restarted my computer multiple times and nothing i even deleted it and reinstalled it 

please let me know what i am doing wrong or who i need to contact about this i would really love to play the game thank you

#####

i will say its a very addictive and satisfying game
almost has a gambler addict kind of feel opening up a storage locker and seeing if you make profit

there are lots of items you can find with all different values and sizes and already enough content to keep you going for some time
that being said its still very incomplete however there is much more the devs can do to flesh the game out many more ways they can add content to allow for a long grind and player retention

its good to see the devs are active in the official discord keeping players informed of new updates which is nice and have my fingers crossed they continue with the project until full release hopefully within a year and not drop it like most indie sim games recently

#####

the game is very fun and addictive but there are quite a number of bugsglitches in the game but it is in early access and i can only hope they fix the problems in the near future

#####

all of my play time for this game is trying to load a new game

#####

is fun

#####

very good game

#####

this game is relaxing and its fun i definitely recommend it

#####

game is fun to play 


#####

yes

#####

update from below original review

game is making updates and getting better i am leaving my original review because most of it is still valid

this game is a blast until you buy the store i do recommend when on sale because it will be great if you are reading this anytime around march 2024 and just started playing do not buy a store you make way more money and is much more fun in the flea market type area it is more fast paced and engaging at the market i bet this game will be great when more developed and more options while owning the store 

ps i wish you could sell your shop and go back to the market 

#####

good

#####

so many bugs i played the game for 32 hours and encountered a bug where my saves didnt actually save if i wasnt over 2 hours i would have refunded this game

#####

overall i recommend the game its a lot of fun addictive  has a huge amount of potential yes there are bugs specifically the yeeting of items halfway across the map  the walkin units have issues but nothing that makes the game unplayable with some fine tuning itll be a great game the developer seems to be actively adding fixes and content if anything keep it on your wishlist and see where it is in a couple months but dont entirely write it off

#####

fun game with potential  shame to see a lot of bad reviews because of old bugs that they fixed

#####

i really enjoy the game and honestly cannot wait to see what more will be added in future the fact its this addictive in early access is always a good sign

#####

it is a good game and idea but its still in early stages and some things are quite frustrating which is stopping me playing more  needs to be more worthwhile owning a shop eg more customers and staff who can sell items for you
havent tried the auctions yet as my saves wouldnt show up even though they were in the game directory so had to start again
i would recommend it but maybe wait for some of the bugs to be fixed

#####

pretty cool game


#####

im hooked 34 hours in game i love it

#####

a fun game do you enjoy a game with a grind well most simulator games have a repetitive grind to them and this one does also but it is a pleasant and enjoyable grind it is therefore a fun game for most people you buy storage lockers sightunseen to get stuff for resale and then you personally sell the stuff at a flea market or a shop this game is not automatic for profits and you can lose money sometimes after awhile you can participate as a buyer at a big and fancy auction if you win an item during the auction you can then sell it at your shop the auction was a recent addition and i was not expecting the auction feature and it was an interesting idea and implementation developer shows good imagination and ability to make a fun game

#####

ui is massive on a ultrawide monitor cant even see what im doing because of it
map doesnt even work properly on the resolution either
needs fixed for 3840 resolutions

#####

after 100 hrs of play there is a lot this game has to offer but that is negated by the fact that i found myself repeating days and losing thousands of money due to the game not saving this issue seamed to arise with the last update  i save the game before starting a new day yet i have no game saves to load i thought i would play this game for a long time but i was wrong i feel that there is no point in continuing playing as ingame progress is not something that can be counted on thank you   after an additional 100 plus hours of play i am changing my review i would and have recommended this game to friends during the last 100 plus hours of play i had to repeat only on day while i still have no games to load the save feature seems to be working the addition of the auction house both art and cars is a terrific addition to this game i look forward to future additions it is not unreasonable for me to expect to play well into the 1000s of hours time frame i am glad i gave this game a second chance hats off to the devs  

#####

i am enjoying playing this game it is fun and addictive and looking forward to more updates there is a great selection of items to sell and i hope there is more to come however because i have to play on the lowest setting driving and picking up items is janky especially when diving because the other cars are wobbling as they drive past other than that i think this game has great potential and i am looking forward to watching its growth

#####

i cant play the game it just crash right after i click new game then load press anykey and crash i have intel i7 2600 16gb ram and geforce 1660 super and settings turn to low still wont play am i doing something wrong

#####

your saved slots are always gone

#####

this is my first review on a game i would like to thank quadfix game for releasing a fun and relaxing game game is really fun its like owning a pawn shop but on its current state it is unplayable all my saved have been deleted even when restarting a new game my save wouldnt show up so i couldnt load any of my saves if they fix the bugs or framerate drops items clipping or character clipping falling from the wrold etc etc this game has pontential auction update just released and i really wanted to play it but i couldnt because i have to start in the very beginning so i couldnt save money to bid i had a lot of fun playing this game its very addicting and relaxing but please fix the bugs specially the save bugs because i load any of my save and have to restart from the beginning making the game unplayable for many hope quadfix games sees this and release a patch or a hotfix thank you

#####

played this game for over 33 hours only to have my truck get stuck off of the road and i am completely unable to move or to reset the truck loved this game and now its completely unplayable this is effed up an option needs to be added for this

#####

this is a fun game to play if you are looking to relax yes there are bugs like a dvd or a game being laid down can toss a big pc or one of the battery cars you can ride in but the game is still in really early access and will hopefully be fixed when its all said and done but besides that the game is amazing

#####

i enjoy it but it needs work very glitchy too hard to put items in vehicles items always disappear sometimes the vehicle wont move at all but minus that stuff its a decent time killing game i just cant recommend it i played for 6 hours finally got going and building up and then my vehicle got stuck after sleeping with items in it and had no way to move and half of the items were gone

#####

this game is pretty awesome if you like the flipping items lifestyle the game has been doing many updates and it seems like they are on the up  up i would recommend and ive been having a blast playing this game

#####

the game remind me of a tv show called storage wars everyone who liked that show should try this out
there are some small bugs here and there because the game is still fresh i dont mind but overall game is pretty enjoyable and relaxing
maybe add some more cars to choose from and maybe car color variant d

#####

i been enjoy the game after 4 hours to be honest  i only have one dis like on the game and that is the icon they are and the way of traffic to be honest i think they should be remove or make it optional to be honest  the icon are okay on the map thats fine  i just dont like them and the way of traffic i hope you guys will undersand what im saying on the icon and im very sorry for my bad type  other then that its a great game to be honest its still needs a lot of bugs fix and performance  i hope they will keep on update the game and also fix the bugs aswell

#####

dealer simulator is a game that lets you experience the thrill of running your own shop you can choose from different types of items to sell you can also hire staff and deal with customers i enjoy playing because it is fun challenging and rewarding it is a game that appeals to anyone who likes simulation games business games or casual games it is a game that i would recommend to anyone who is looking for a game that is entertaining engaging and addictive

#####

although i havent played the game too long it is a fairly good game theres a few bugs that are annoying but arent as common as other games and in general its great my personal favourite part is doing the boot sales im quite sad i have to buy the smallest shop in order to go to the auction and leave my boot sale but all in all its a fun little selling game 1010

#####

love this game  it gets pretty addicting very quickly

#####

this game is a lot of fun for being a early access game it has a good amount of stuff in there game to be fun and the grind is worth it to build up your empire of being a shop dealer there are bugs but if you can get see pass the bugs this is a game worth playing however there is one downside and i hope they fix this bug asap for a lot of folks there is a bug for some that stops some from playing but if your lucky enough to be able to play this game is worth the money and more content will come for this game so devs keep up the hard work and bring more content to your amazing game im loving this when i can play it just to relax and sell some items and make money i have gotten up to the small store after grinding 40 in game days

#####

tldr
a crude warehouse buy and item selling simulator
that has amazing potential but still needs development

good sides
for the pricetag it massively delivers on playing potential if your a fan of this genre that is
the basic grind from a small car to a big truck and from a free market slot to a store is fun
there already is a lot of different items to discover and sell playing around with the items as object in the game setting up some fun shop designs and the general item handling feels great and at the same time can be frustrating when you grab the wring item and 5 others fly towards narnia

bad sides
 once your rich there is no point unless you just enjoy the game and roleplay
 vehicle handling is quite poor slip and slide on the road and dont even bother offroading
 vehicles tend to bug out in different way but there is a easy way of selling and rebuying them for no loss and that fixes any issue
 lacklustre shopsworkers once u get the shop you still need to sell everything yourself the workers do a little to help but you do feel like you should get more for the grind of buying one
 weak skill system where you unlock every skill in the first few hours way before you even get to the shop and end up with 200 extra skill points before you know it
 lacking qol you gota do a lot yourself in grindy ways the best part of the game is opening a storage unit and looking for goodies witch is hard offset by slow customers customers coming with weak offers and generally taking a long time to empty inventory to the point where you just dont feel like taking those 1535 items at all because it will take half a day to sell them where you could sell and go buy another unit hoping for that secret whale
 the new auctions system is visually really nice it brings quite a lot of flareee to the game but also makes it to easy since u can invest 10k to get 30k per night it is just to strong and powers to buy the big truck or big storehome super fast and kills of the fun  of having a goal

still a fun game that i will gladly follow

#####

while the game still has it kinks and bugs it is very promising and the development is at the time of writing very active i like many aspects of the game especially the discovery and sorting at the storage units of course i would like to have the repair and shelf stocking automated but this will take some time to develop no game is perfect but this one is good and i like it

#####

pretty decent so far looking forward to future fixes and updates

#####

highly recommend this game for all savvy sellers its early days on this game but there is loads to sell and it is expanding with more features

#####

the game is every good

#####

its worth the current price of  15 you can get a solid 1015 hours of fun out of the game before needing to take a break solid physics and tons of new items

#####

love this concept
the idea of buying storages en selling them on the market or your own shop is awesome
there are a few bugs and a some updates needed but overal  this game got potentie to be even better with more things to do in the future for sure

#####

saving the game disappears after activating the price show this is a big problem i have replayed the game more than once for long hours and every time the same problem appears i hope to solve the problem as soon as possible

#####

awesome game so fun and addictive i just cant stop playing if they add wheel support and fix the bugs ill score it 1010
for now its a 910

here is my first look video if you want to see my initial thoughts with commentary

httpsyoutubehc6ltywyg8sivz0gceyy8amydxlr

#####

this game is full of glitches 1 being that my vehicles are constantly getting stuck so you have to walk to the dealer i super slow speeds to sell then re buy your car so you can have it usable again also there is no easy ways to get around the map the game is fun as long as you can get used to all the glitching and be ok with loosing progress some time when the game doesnt want to save

#####

loving the game so far looking forward to future updates

#####

only played for under 9 hours so far at time of writing this i enjoy it just wish sometimes more sale spots were available at the starting market and maybe like a warehouse to store goods in before sale so you can sort through what you got a unit for the dvdsgames would be good that could store better than like 1 sale spot per item i find the time passes to quickly as well you open up get a few customers sort out new items then close up it just seems to quick for me but on the whole a decent game glad ive come across it

#####

i honestly thoroughly enjoy this game and i genuinely hope this game is supported for a long time

#####

not working

#####

one of the most addictive games i have played in years yes there are some bugs but all in all its a great game i cant wait to see what the devs have planned next hopefully they add more skills and abilities soon because i filled out my skill tree a while ago and have like 200 points that i cant spent on anything also more vehicle options including trailers would be really cool to see

#####

great game so far couple bugs but to be expected but 1000 recommend

#####

this game is great the driving takes some getting used too and so far there is not an unstuck button but overall i am having a great time playing

#####

good game

#####

i understand in early access and you get what you pay for has lots of potential to be a nice little game 
 issues with driving aspect really hard to control and as soon as you clip the tiny af sidewalk your car goes flying
 items getting lost through the world happened only twice but were little money makers
should have option for longer days
 theres not alot to actually do except for same thing and build up money and move to bigger premises one house to buy or buying bigger cartruck again potential to be more but that is all it is at this stage in a nutshell
 dont upgrade to the little van you cant get in it to get your items at the back of the van
 the roads are cut off everywhere by barriers and takes ages to drive around to anything everything seems so far away
 do not and i repeat do not drive on anything else but the road if you read this and did it you only have yourself to blame and probably have burning internal rage the terrian to cut across will lead to tears
 no story line no goals 
i presume in time with it being in early access it will eventually turn out to be really good graphics are decent enough and runs fine at this stage keeping my eye on the updates for this one

#####

really fun

#####

any chance you can fix the items falling through the floor

#####

i got this game a couple days ago and i go into the menu and press new game and then got to the part where i had to press any key and i have tried anythinge to fix it because it keeps on loging me out i have 43 hours only because i left it on thinking that i needed 2 hours or more to refund the game 


thank you for responding but i need a little directions on how to find the file to delete

#####

real fun very addicting there are a few bugs that are a little frustrating such as some items i pickup just go flying and i can never find them but nothing game breaking that i have experienced cant wait for future updates

#####

while the game itself is somewhat fun there are multiple problems with it and it can be quite repetitive the vehicles if they touch grass loose all control and can get stuck however there is no way to unstuck the vehicle so you better hope to have enough money to buy a new vehicle if you buy a store the old market disappears and the store has no shelves to sell anything so once again if you didnt plan for this you are out of luck overall i would not recommend it in its current state

#####

addictive great game but few bugs to sort out looking forward to the new updates and possible fixes day 7 and still playing

#####

good game but my save keeps dissapearing twice ive had to restart now

#####

even though the game is still very early in making i do enjoy the game quite a bit granted it does have some issues and it does lack a lot of features but what indie game in early access doesnt the base idea of the game is there and you can see what theyre going for in the future the price not bad for gameplay that it currently has the developer is also very active talking about plans and showing sneak peaks within the discord this will be a game ill be keeping my eye on im excited to see how far it goes in the next few months

#####

pretty fun but i have a question can i have two items that are the same on one spot for example i found two camera 1800s can i put them on the same slot and if so do i need to have the price at 850 for each or do i need to have it at 1700

#####

great start with lots of potential can play this game for hours without realizing excited to see where it goes from here

#####

im enjoying playing the game but there are a few things you could do to improve female character fix it so items dont disappear when you save dont know if bug or not but it doesnt always happen and exit to menu pause function

#####

i think the game can become pretty decent as the updates roll out there are a few bugs with it but its so early on that most games are like this i have played 10 hours of it now an still having fun with it as i get better things id like to see a better perk system for sure though

#####

i like it its pretty fun

#####

its good 


#####

i bought the game because it looks fun and i cant even play it and i have the required stuff to run this game and cant even play it on the lowest settings but i hope they fix that so maybe i can actually play the game

#####

so i bought dealer simulator for myself after looking around at early access games to enjoy and i was pleasantly surprised

early access  theres bugs glitches every now and then and some frustrating obstacles ive run into through my time playing but thats the fun of these early access games watching something grow over time to what the developer has in mind is  and always will be  the most satisfying gaming experience 

having to restart or go back to an earlier save because my car got stuck in a way that it couldnt get out is my only big gripe other than no autosave feature through the day while youre playing everything else like not having my hand held and having to figure things out on my own is super refreshing 

also the fact all the dudes in the game look like theyre constantly attempting not to break out into naruto running is a huge plus and i beg of you not to change it 

all in all i think its an amazing game to play if youre experiencing early access games for the first time to really see how updates and processes go with singular developers who knows it could become one of your favorite games 

#####

thank you for the beautiful game you are the best game design studio 2024

#####

after buying this game it wont even play few people have commented the same issue but no reply from developer on how to play the game we have purchased looks like a refund which is disapointing

#####

ok so ive been on this a few hours now and actually i really like it does it have some glitches and bugs  of course it does its early access but its a lot of fun and i hope the dev keeps it going as i can see this being a really enjoyable chilledout game

#####

like the game alot  runs really well please please please make the game a little more friendly for ultrawide monitors

#####

my game keeps crashing when it says press any letter is there a way to fix this

#####

items go flying from the trunk for no reason and the game becomes finding waldo sticky walls no vehicle reset button hella repetitive after an hour

edit just make the items in your trunk static

the most expensive box truck has a bugged floor and items go inside the floor

#####

a great little game if you can ignore the obvious bits this could keep me entertained for hours 
would like to see better roads and driving maybe collision damage and repair so far so good and if the dev keeps updating could be a really good one

#####

not bad game got get use to it

#####

in early access i can recommend this game for its price and hours of fun you will experience

much fun how you can set the layout in your store and with the second store like i have made a general store and the small store i gonna make a electric computer shop or a jewelery  d

lol i dont know why some people speak very negativly about a eary access game with a few bugs or glitches in there common for most games but overal no glitches are game breaking and with some common sense the game is easy to figure out the way the game plays i feel satisfied how it works and i like the design and how the objects or items look the details im very pleased with

the game developers are very active and the game gets frequently updates


btw if i wanne make a blame to the developers its because they made me addicted to this game   


a big recommendation for trader seller shop addicted gamer  a

#####

its a fun game to play for an early acces game its good hope the devs keep adding content to the game
i expact this game will give me enough fun hours now and in the future

#####

great start for early access of course its not perfect there is potential but it feel like a rough draft at some point it will be worth if they keep improving the game at is potential i hope they will actually improve it because if they dont i got scam for that price i enjoyed it but i wont recommend if you want to play for hours for now its still just a test for 35 hours maximum and there is about 20 of it driving and looking dumb packing the truck with some weird hitbox and mechanics im not sure if i will ever play this game again but i hope the devs give me the reason for it

i have to say the save is just broken if you turn or block your car and dont have money to buy a new one this need a fix asap i got lucky by turning it with a mission of transport but this should not be a thing

#####

the game has a cool concept on its hands but it is not ready to be played in its current state instead of a dealer simulator it is a terrible driving simulator the map is too big for you to just be sliding around everywhere on terrible physics they shouldve went with more of a fast travel system as opposed to whatever this is this game as of writing this review is in an alpha state of play and should not be available to purchase i may revisit this in the future if the game gets solid dev support and updates not an early access game for the next 10 years

tldr concept cool gameplay bad

#####

rolled the truck and there is no way of resetting it got a refund maybe in a year it may be better and a way to reset the vehicles

#####

i like it needs time in the oven still 100

#####

the game keep closed when i open it and stuck in loading screen so the game closed what i can do  i was so interest to play 


#####

a very fun game starting literally from scratch d

#####

need to add flip function on vehicles my cars stuck and had to restart game to sort it

#####

the perfect game for boredom a game that will entertain you a lot by kicking cars and bargaining i recommend it if you are looking for a simulation game in this style

#####

great idea needs much more work

#####

not gonna lie game needs a lot of work and polish but has a solid foundation

#####
