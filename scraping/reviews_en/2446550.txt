31424
first hour of launch
only have 3 servers to join massing about 200 people rounded up seriously wtf is this ill update this review if i can actually join a lobby

update was only able to join one heros vs villains match and the heros side was completely broken no one could join the heros team which resulted in no one to fight against i figured this may have been just a bf2 issue so i hopped on over to play bf1 multiplayer theres 0 servers up for bf1 wow 

seriously how hard is it to launch a working functioning game ill continue to update this review as time goes on

31524 update 2 they added a bunch of servers heres the problem actually heres several 
shots that you hit players with wont register at all every player is popping in and out everywhere to the point where you will just die randomly swimming through molasses would be smoother than multiplayer combat matches end in about 2 minutes tops due to the such small amount of tickets required to win whoever made the official servers set that low requirement for some reason 

the quick match button never works to the point where youre forced to manually join servers that always have incorrect player counts servers that say they are full most likely arent and servers that arent most likely are the aforementioned issue with the other team not being able to spawn in is still there meaning matches are permanently broken until the enemy team just takes all the flags forcing a new round to begin theres also pretty noticeable input lag on both controller and mouse and keyboard i tried both

thats all of note from me more bugs discovered than fixed i hope they fix these server issues because good god is it disgustingly bad

the only good thing i can say about this collection is the smooth single player framerate and gameplay ive personally heard of bad experiences happening there such as the aforementioned input lag and the occasional crash though ive had a wonderful experience playing singleplayer no issues that i can personally protest

even with the solid singleplayer experience on my end this game is far from being worth 30

if patches are made and the multiplayer is fixed ill gladly turn this review around ill continue updating this review if any significant changes are made

#####

asides from all the issues mentioned by all the players this repack breaks most mods for pc due to changes in the file system that to me make no sense since the game is as buggy as the previous version or worse how can this have more bugs than the old version its not better and the new functions like splitscreen barely work as a modder who has worked on a big mod project for this game for years i find this release pitiful to say the least and its a shame that we modders were not consulted as they were for the tomb raider remaster which gave great results for that particular release together they made the game better

i never review games btw but im not happy about this at all and neither is the community

my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined

#####

h3you were the chosen one it was said you would destroy the sith not join them bring balance to the force not leave it in darknessh3

#####

released an hour late
10k players at launch
200 player server capacity
20 year old game with larger storage demand than elden ring
horrible hitreg
buggy as can be
zero acknowledgement of any game issues just server issues
35
refunded

they may fix it later on i dont care launching a cornerstone game like this in these conditions is unacceptable

#####

just get the old battlefront 2 on steam and install the battlefront 2 remastered mod from moddb its 20 dollars cheaper and the mod fixes a lot of issues from the pc version of the game not only that but it also has heaps of modded content as well as multiplayer support

the classic edition is some of the laziest crap ive ever seen from a rerelease looks to me all they did was rip the console version of the game and upscaled everything up to 8k using ai without touching up any of the visual artifacts created from the upscaling nor did they compress any of the textures which likely explains the massive game size a lot of sounds are either missing incorrectly pitched or completely wrong they promised crossplay which is a complete lie rebinding my controls was super bugged especially in multiplayer and i found a handful of graphical bugs and gameplay issues just from the 43 minutes i had with this game alone even if they ironed out most of these issues which i highly doubt they will i still cant get over how lazily this game pushed out and i feel like a complete tool for joining the hype train on this one

#####

so let me get this straight you launched this game with only 3 servers on pc knowing full well people only bought it for that sole reason peak comedy gold easy refund what a dissapointment

update after 2 hours they finally launched the servers and they are terrible horrible ping stuttering and by tomorrow cheaters will be rampant

#####

playing this version of the game is like cheating on your wife except instead of a hot mistress its just jabba the hutt pegging you

#####

refunded dont let them get away with a filthy cashgrab

#####

this is like the equivalent of finding your kid 20 years later and you see them hooked up on fent while gooning in their basement

#####

concerning trend lately in the industry of smaller teams being bought by larger parents contracted and licensed projects like this and completely missing the ball

licensed a pc windows port to a subsidiary that specializes in mac and linux ports proof is in the pudding



no servers















youre repurchasing what may as well amount to an aiupscale of battlefront 1 and 2 with no additions if not alterations made for the worse

its the little things that break that experience for me the objective complete sound from the original seems to be missing the victory and defeat sounds are oddlyslowed or pitchshifted its really odd it almost makes you wonder if it could have just been a mod created by the community at this rate

i can accept dysfunctional multiplayer as a givengamble with games these days but three servers for pc seems too much like a pantsonhead assbackwards kind of decision that was made without any forethought to have actually been a purposeful decision im not too mad about that im assuming this will be solved quickly

#####

look how they massacred my boy is all to be said here

#####

scam


#####

absolutely amazing with no problems would recommend steam really did a great job with their customer service and refund process being so painless

the game is however complete turbo junk dont touch it with a 10 ft pole

#####

trust the reviews were in a time period of developershareholder greed fight back with your wallet

#####

so
the developers nowadays dont have the capacity enough to even rerelease ps2 games

#####

bought the game specifically so i could see for myself how truly awful it is and so i could leave a review and inform people
dont buy this its not just the netcode that is broken but various aspects of the original games are also missing broken or corrupt missing sound effects misaligned or missing textures entire cutscenes being ommitted from the campaign mode its bad enough you cant play multiplayer without seeing all the enemies floating around and phasing through your shots but even the campaign is just a worse way to experience the games 
do yourself a favour and go buy the original games theyre still on steam cheaper take up less space and you can install mods to make them even more fun

update
we now have confirmation that aspyr stole modded files for use on kit fisto and asajj
httpstwittercomiamashayminstatus1769062737236123838

so not only is the game lazily slapped together with mcdonalds wifi netcode ai upscaled textures and not a single new feature added but the minor things that were added in the two heroes were outright stolen from the hard labour of modders who actually care about the game theyre in the legal right to do so but morally bankrupt for claiming they didnt do it at all

ive since played the original with the remaster mod and i highly encourage the rest of you to do that instead its so much better

#####

aspyr killed the game on launch stole from modders without giving credit and somehow made two 20 year old games take up 70 gb this remaster is a complete mess and should have been given to a competent team

#####

how is it possible that this game takes more space than elden ring

#####

hehehell nawl

#####

as of now the game is dead on arrival multiplayer completely broken might as well play the original

#####

its honestly impressive that you can turn 10gbs of games from 2004 and 2005 into 60gbs

#####

do not play this game if you intend to play with friends from another country this game is region locked

#####

terrible launch developer should be ashamed how do you screw up a classic collection your work is already done for most of it get it together refunded

#####

biggest bag fumble of 2024

#####

buy the 2005 editions and save yourself hdd space and money

#####

do not buy unless servers are fixed 
currently game is totally unplayable even if you manage to get into a server players cannot spawn not sure if its a cheaterdenial thing bugged gameplay or both

if you bought dont waste your 2 hour refund window till confirmation of fix

314 updated review
servers are workingish there are undeniable latency issues in both bf1 and 2 no patches so far since launch

#####

unfortunately even if they fix it i think the player base wont come back so this might be doa

#####

this is not where the fun begins

#####

gotta love that if you host an online match you are stuck at 30 frames a second because asspyr didnt think of tick rates the host is sacrificing themselves like jesus up on the cross for the rest of the lobbies sins

#####

go buy helldivers 2 instead of giving these shitters your money

#####

i didnt know it was possible to unfinish already finished games but here we are

#####

the force is weak with this one

#####

as of right now the multiplayer otherwise known as the only reason to buy this product if you already own the original games is entirely unplayable making this game a waste of money until that issue is fixed disappointing

#####

1010 would refund again

#####

at the moment this is a severe downgrade from the original versions of the game
a small list of the issues that i can remember
h1multiplayerh1
 every multiplayer host and client has to go through a middleman which significantly increases latency causing rubberbanding all over the place on a server that is in the same room as me i get 70 ping
 every multiplayer host has to synchronously wait for the middleman to respond causing significant framerate drops down to less than the tick rate in frames per second
 the tickrate is immutable even though it is internally mutable
 nowhere does the game describe which ports to forward for the dedicated server making this knowledge esoteric and requiring the user to reverse engineer or use external tools to discover the answer is 5055 and 5056
 there is no way to run the dedicated server without locking up your steam account making it impossible to play on your own dedi without two steam accounts which own the game as described before hosting the server in nondedicated mode may tank your framerate
 filling the name of a dedicated server creates a strange bug in which you cannot launch the game and the selected maps get deleted
 naboo is a banned work
 the sort by options on the server browser are nonfunctional
 searching by name on the server browser allows you to input less text than the length of a server name can be
h1gameplayh1
 you are unable to uninvert the flight controls
 the game still uses archaic input libraries making mouselook feel latent and terrible
 mods for the original games are only partially supported though this seems to be by accident meaning that many mods are unplayable which unfortunately limits the selection of content the game offers significantly
 the graphical upgrade is less than that of mods for the original for 40 more gb than its worth not that i care about the size of the game but some might
 the updated consolederived uis are insanely buggy i would much prefer the original pc uis since they were highly functional in comparison
 rhen var crashes the game in bf1

besides all of this its just the xbox version of battlefront with some pc features turned on at its core if you enjoy battlefront you will at the very least enjoy single playerinstant action

i would love to see the following additional features in updates
 multiplayer galactic conquest coop or competitive yes i want to spend 3 hours ruling the galaxy with my bros
 the original pc ui it wasnt buggy and was much more functional

#####

this is not the game you are looking for

#####

what a load of bantha poodoo 

#####

this is my first time writing a review for a game i spent a big chunk of my preteens playing the originals and i have lots of fond memories this release is the worst gaming experience of my entire life i am disappointed beyond words i tried playing this mess and was in denial for a few hours running high purely on nostalgia however i quickly sobered up to how bad this is how can you mess up a 20 year old game how lazy and incompetent is the team behind this especially for this price tag this is shameless robbery i feel like my childhood has been ripped apart instead of fond memories now i only have disdain when i think of this series i cannot believe the corporate greed and laziness do people not have pride in their work anymore i hope everyone gets their money back do not purchase

#####

yes i recommend refunding this game

#####

great they fixed some issuesso what the launch of this game is just straight up disgraceful and played upon peoples nostalgia and nothing more its so incredibly disappointing battlefront 2 especially was genuinely one of the best games of my childhood i played the hell out of it on the psp and have many fond memories of the old star wars games on that system i bought this almost immediately just hoping for some form of up to date version of previously beloved games and instead i and many other people get a huge slap in the face with many issues that shouldve never been prevalent in this collection at this point i dont even care if multiplayer is better its just not worth supporting such shitty business practices from a mediocre at best company dont buy this collection ever unless its massively on sale even then just reconsider booting up your old copies of these games and youll get genuinely not much different of an experience i so badly wish these classic games were treated with more respect than this but ive lost hope in the gaming industry this is but one of many reasons 
have a good day to whoever reads im sorry for what theyve done lets enjoy other great games or the ogs of these instead  

#####

im so sorry i tried i tried so hard to wait for this game to be good to look past its flaws and enjoy the nostalgia but i cant do it anymore dont buy this game im freakin heartbroken

#####

if you want a genuine fun experience refund this game and buy the original titles then go to moddb and remaster it yourself trust me itll save you a lot of time and money

and like i saw on another review this was the biggest bag fumble of 2024

#####

ive been playing swbf2 since 2005 and developing and shipping mods for it since 2010 i cannot faithfully recommend this collection at this time play time says 02 hours but i was watching footage all day yesterday as well a lot of this is notes gathered by the modding community that i agree with

 vertex colors seem to have been completely removed from all of the environment art which completely removes all the baked lighting from the interior maps and the end result looks terrible
 the console version of the instant action screen is and has always been terrible adding missions is slow and cumbersome and a massive pain i get why they did it for controller users but it really sucks for kbm same with the spawn screen for kbm as iconic as it may have been for the console versions i understand now why pandemic used a different spawn screen for pc
 frame rate is capped to 30fps in multiplayer matches
 starfighter controls appear to be inverted for some reason by default not sure if this is still relevant
 water across the board looks worse it seems theyve removed the specular layer from it but im not sure
 almost all the environment art has a weird strong specular shine to it and in most cases it looks really bad doesnt help that its shaded pervertex instead of perpixel
 font is ugly af what on earth
 loadscreens look terrible including the atrocious tooltip box ui texture which is blown way up for some reason plus the black bars have been removed from the top and bottom which makes the other text really hard to read in some cases
 all the maps are just brighter overall with unexplained blooming surfaces
 weird debug cubes at the bottom of every doorway
 weapon scope textures are cut off on the left and right side of the screen which looks horrible i dont even know how that one went unnoticed
 medals dont show in the endgame screen
 loads of random overlapping text in various uls across the game

theres many more issues but its honestly too much to list if all you care about is better multiplayer and splitscreen then go for it i guess otherwise stick to the original releases of this game

once again it appears that the modding community will have to clean up after yet another butchering of these games its really unfortunate hopefully at least some of this will be addressed in a future patch or two but i wouldnt count on it

#####

holy crap manthis is prob the worst cash grab ive ever played even the flying in the space maps is broken my ship would randomly glitch out and stop flying leaving me stuck i have the original disks for my xbox still and tbh the originals look better on the series x in 4k than this pile of hot garbage aspyr should be ashamed of themselves

#####

fastest refund this side of the mississippi

#####

star wars battlefront classic collection was the most disappointing thing since my son i mean how much more could you possibly screw up port of a 20 year old game

#####

absolute hot garbage got a refund

#####

i purchased this game with the sole intent of leaving a bad review before uninstalling and completing my refund speedrun 

charging 35 for this battlefront collection is as asinine as it is greedy considering that its not a remaster there are no updated graphics and it does not include any additional content while the originals from 2004 and 2005 are still available for a combined total of 20 999 each this trickles into another issue file size its absolutely baffling to me how this requires 6070gb of storage when its a lazy copypaste rerelease of two games that have a combined size of 7gb this is what happens when you hire people based on their political opinions over their technical qualifications an increasing issue in the gaming industry its not the consumers responsibility to offset the payroll deficits you cant justify and refuse to rectify  

the entire point of this release was the resurrection of online multiplayer upon release there are only 3 servers available each with a player cap of 64 meaning there can only be a maximum of 192 players at any given time there are third party programs that allow you to run multiplayer servers albeit without matchmaking for the classic 2004 and 2005 releases of battlefront this effectively negates any reason to purchase this collection since all aspyr did was charge a 35 premium for a 20 experience most of us have already paid for

modders and memers have kept the star wars battlefront community alive and relevant for two decades now had there been a modicum of effort on aspyr medias part they could have tapped into that limitless potential instead they grifted us with this lazily contrived nostalgia cash grab resulting in a missed opportunity to bring these beloved classics back to the forefront not only for star wars fans but for gamers as a whole worse yet its been confirmed aspyr utilized mod community content in their final commercial product and didnt even have the due diligence to use the most recent version link to the original modders steam forum post httpssteamcommunitycomapp2446550discussions04347732779392154378 what work did aspyr even contribute to this collection outside of bumming an outdated mod for their copypaste rerelease of a pandemic studios game from two decades ago 

this level of corporate greed and incompetence is something id expect from an electronic arts release again both original battlefront releases from 2004 and 2005 cost a combined total of 20 are we actually being charged a 15 premium for the effort that went into lazily googling and installing an outdated version of a free mod into a copypaste rerelease of two games aspyr had no part in developing its absolutely disgusting to see how comfortable aspyr is charging 35 for this collection when its nothing more than a testament to borrowed content with a premium price tag even with functional multiplayer this game should have never exceeded a retail price of 30 

its no wonder aspyr media is no longer the lead developer on the knights of the old republic remake they shouldnt be involved in any project development larger than a mobile game 
the star wars battlefront classic collection is a massive waste of time and money and should be removed from the steam store the gaming industry will never change until we lead with our wallets do not ever buy this product under any circumstances

not sure why it isnt saying so at the top but this product was successfully refunded the day i posted this review

#####

good it is not refunded you should be

#####

do not buy this

#####

obvious cash grab

only 3 online servers with 64 player cap per server
30 fps lock in online for bf2
controller feels unplayable random acceleration and x and y axis is wildly unsynced
i know it wasnt in the original game but how did you not add galactic conquest online coop

#####

game is functionally broken and content has been removed from the original games get a refund and buy the original games themselves for cheaper

#####

h1better buy the original editionsh1
dont spoil your impression of such a wonderful game this edition is no different from the original except for more glitches and bugs aspyr did not even improve the quality of the videos shown before missions

#####

h1 if it only took four days to fix most of the huge issues why didnt they just delay it h1

they fixed servers not appearing fixed texture issues seemingly removeddisabled the modded content fixed the cut scenes etc 

all of this backlash could have easily been avoided if they had just released four days later
however this didnt fix everything of course 

issues that remain include random spikes of loud audio some intermittent disconnects wrong font for hud elements in both games and probably some other things i failed to mention

b only recommending based on the patch if you can get the game cheaper than the asking price or after the next patch b


#####

i hope aspyr goes out of business

#####

probably one of the worst launches of all time none of us can get in a game and there are only 3 servers lol

but im looking forward to changing this to a positive

#####

what a scam just buy and play the original bf2

#####

reading these reviews is more fun than trying to play this game online

#####

please just trust everyone elses reviews and do not buy this nostalgia baiting cash grab piece of crap the multiplayer the only reason many of us even considered buying this is absolutely broken maybe this will eventually be worth your time and money but currently they couldnt pay me to play this shame on you aspyr

#####

was gifted this and still refunded it because i dont want to support it ai upscaling all the textures and ripping content from modders with no credit im wondering if yall actually did any work or if you just paid a 15 year old on fiverr to do it all

the modders content was included after explicitlly stating it would be removed by release 

glad steam allowed the gifter to refund

#####

i gave into nostalgia and wanting to relive some past memories with a populated mp again its a miracle aspyr even were allowed to do this after all the garbage ports theyve done for other games in the franchise like kotor ii on switch lo and behold they have yet again proven why they are the lowest denominator studio when it comes to this shit

b all b of the end of mission cutscenes for battlefront 2s campaign are missing the audio for victory and defeat motifs are slowed and stretched to the point of sounding warped objective taken and lost sound effects are bugged and so are the iconic loading screen beepsboops from battlefront 1 there are no invert y axis controls for either game making flying during space missions near unbearable personally the multiplayer matches have had their player counts doubled from 32 to 64 players for some reason only to have a 100 tickets for each team making them stupidly short like 5 fucking minutes lol instead of the fun tug of war your should get in a conquest match

modern lucasfilm seem to be content in continuing the trend of whoring out the ip to garbage studios like aspyr and even worse publishers like ea and ubisoft none of the issues above will ever be fixed dont get your hopes up and think a patch will come to rectify it in a few weeks merely look at their track record republic commando is still broken on switch kotor ii never got any of its promised uncut mod additions they apparently after a month still havent even fixed modern controls in their tomb raider remasters go and buy the original 2 titles when they go on sale for a fraction of the price during may the 4th

#####

you were the chosen one

#####

regrettably this is not a game but rather a glimpse into the future landscape of gaming this release stands as such a profound insult to consumers and the gaming industry alike i would not be shocked if its impact may well be remembered as the defined start of a serious decline in gaming

#####

its a shame i have to thumb this game down battlefront and battlefront 2 the original 04 and 05 releases were the first shooter games i ever played on my ps2 growing up some of my earliest gaming memories come from these games so you can bet i was excited to play this  those games are absolutely fantastic and are a better buy at 10 each than this 35 pile of sht 

there is hardly anything new added to the game only the textures have been upscaled which means even the hud elements are the exact same and look terrible on modern display resolutions its such a simple and small thing to have to recreate but we couldnt even get high res hud elements seriously guys  a single modder could have done better work with rtx remix than this development team 

the multiplayer is the only selling point over the originals but it barely works the multiplayer for bf2 is currently not functional every time i try i get into a hero match and i am unable to spawn in the multiplayer for bf1 is playable but not much better aspyr increased the player count for servers from the original 32 to 64 and did not think how this might impact gameplay so they changed nothing about the spawns the spawn rate or the score limit and did not care to implement an auto balance feature the result are matches that are horribly unbalanced that last 34 minutes 

please avoid this game at all costs and if you want to experience the single player content of these games just buy the originals together they are 20 but if i recall correctly there is a bundle you can get both for 15 that is a much better buy considering the multiplayer for the old games is currently more functional than the new version and the upscaled textures basically do nothing for the visuals  dont give this lazy dev team money for half assed work you deserve better as a consumer

#####

many people criticize this release because of issues with the multiplayer let me offer my criticism as someone who focuses on single player 
1 the iconic loading screen sound in bf1 has been replaced with a new dull one maybe this is a bug the objective complete r2d2 sound in bf2 is replaced with a more dull one too and the victory screen music is off 
2 for some reason theyve removed the original swbf2 crosshair settings the setting called reticule transparency i always liked disabling most of the crosshair and leaving just the small white dot also i cant stand the yellow heat meter on the crosshair i want to disable it 
3 starfigher control in space battles is a bit off even with turn assist turned off and more mouse sensitivity it still feels weird slow and clunky compared to the original a huge disappointment for me 
4 the main menu from the console version for bf2 is cool but the user interface during battles for spawn and class selection is counter intuitive for pc and id much prefer the option to bring back the old pc ui  
5 serious sound bugs  mute blaster shots and very annoying noise in ship hangars during space battles also the overal sound in bf2 is too low even on max settings 
6 galactic conquest bonus icons are the old very lowres ones and look off especially the garrison bonus 
7 the huge over 60gb size is not justified for this release they simply havent compressed the audio 
i hope these issues get fixed but for now im refunding

#####

i tried to play bf2 mp but it was quite difficult to enjoy it due to bugs after finishing a match if you press done too quickly it will fail to connect to next match and kick you to the lobby also idk why but matches are so short im talking about like 2 minutes which is ridiculous 
i was expecting a bit of modernization of the menus and maybe new settings etc but nope its all same as the original versions
i only played single player of bf1 and it was okay cant say anything about mp
overall im disappointed and issued a refund if they actually put some effort later on i definitely would love to play until then ill be playing the originals

#####

im honestly embarrassed that i have this in my library i unfortunately played too long to get this refunded which ill own up to but the more that comes out about this release the more my buyers remorse kicks in and any hopes of this becoming good is crushed literally all other star wars battlefront games have more people playing online than this that released 3 days ago a strong buying point they advertised and ive spent more on this than any of those lesson learned i will now remember this moment and avoid all titles aspyr is involved with 

do not buy this as i have learn from my mistake

#####

60 gigabytes btw

#####

the netcode lets me live out my fantasy of being a stormtrooper i cant hit anything guys

#####

the bf1 loading noise is wrong and thats all i should have to tell you about the quality control here

#####

httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvvaivlmhozw

#####

h1 you were the chosen one h1

h1 it was said that you would destroy the sith not join them h1

h1 bring balance to the force not leave it in darkness h1

#####

you cant even watch those wrist rockets

on a more serious note do unotu  and i repeat  do unotu purchase this under ianyi circumstance

there is literally zero reason to play this since you can just grab the original for like 5 and mod that instead
there is no reason to even pirate this

all they managed to do here was break two complete  yes two already ifinishedi games somehow break them to the point they seem unfinished increase their size by an unreasonable amount and sell them to you for more

if anyone deserved order 66 then its aspyr

#####

you had one job

#####

had a preconceived idea that this would be an update to the originals with fixed netcode without many changes if any at all

 65gb taken on disc drive
 inverted vehicle controls which cant be changed in the settings
 battlefront 1 ui slapped onto battlefront 2 with terrible execution
 hosting a game with friends caps you at 30fps
 tested felucia  removed fog and could see through terrain and textures
 played asajj ventress and her model was broken her lefthand lightsaber came out of her right armpit
 launching the game edits my mouse dpi but the resolution stays the same why does it change

im sure there are plenty more issues but with my small test ive had enough and plan to refund  complete cash grab and severely overpriced

#####

no servers















#####

this is just a shameless soulless cash grab worse graphics than 2005 lag 3 servers 

another slap in the face to a fan base that stays loyal despite getting screwed over by disney ea kathleen kennedy etc that loyalty though is tired of being tested and is being destroyed


#####

this is truly a historic moment in video game history never have i seen such incompetence laziness and greed when it comes to a remastered video game seriously how do you release two nearly 20 yearold video games in such a state every aspect of the classic collection is inferior to the original battlefront releases even the graphics are inferior to the existing graphical enhancement mods for the original battlefront releases i wont be surprised if a classaction law suit is the result of this monstrosity

#####

store pagedeveloperaspyroptions gear iconignore this creator
recommend only for controller and split screen support

#####

no multiplayer galactic conquest is the dumbest call ever thats why i bought it again and i cant even play with my friends do not buy

#####

wow probably the laziest excuse of a rerelease ive ever seen just go buy the original swbf2 on steam for 10

#####

horrible and inferior ports and a lazy cash grab by aspyr so far i do not recommend for the reasons below

1 i do not know why they need 60 gigs for what they delivered 

so far there are missing  or worse sounds some textures are worse

2 the keyboard and mouse controls suck and the menus in general suck to navigate 

3 no crossplayregion locked as well oh and at the moment hosts get locked to 30fps when playing online it seems there are very few dedicated servers too

please save your hard earned 30 dollars save 10 more and go buy helldivers 2 instead

the original ports on pc work much better at the moment


do not buy this please these companies need to learn

#####

someone deserves to go to jail for this abomination 

refunded

#####

easiest refund of my life

sold 10k preorders
released with 4 now 3 game servers only one of which is conquest
no anticheat of any kind

i know aspyr was known for being some of the laziest devs but this is some next level shit

#####

my god this needs work 

first of all why the holy hell is my mouse dpi seemingly being changed by the game if the resolution is the same as my desktop resolution there should be no change whatsoever 

second why the holy hell do the two games have completely different settings menus 1 is mostly fine but 2 is god awful not to mention the fact that theres essentially no modern visual settings i mean fxaa is the best aa you can offer and good luck figuring out what the settings will actually do because the game doesnt tell you anything about them

speaking of settings good luck playing on kbm with the defaults in 1 i could swear that the inputs i was making were being actively disobeyed by the game for no good reason and in 2 im pretty sure depending on the mode you are in either left shift or double tapping w is the sprint button because why not

this game needs major qol improvements more than i can possibly express with words i guess as a remaster it barely passes but absolutely no way in hell could this ever qualify as a remake 

if you were expecting to jump into this and have a nice smooth time with some classic games from your childhood keep waiting 

i left out a lot of complaints here because i am absolutely baffled it was released in this state and it only took about 30 minutes of gameplay to come to that conclusion and i think writing this review took longer than that due to my befuddlement

edit apparently the servers are also garbage but i didnt even get as far as to try the multiplayer because i was already so disappointed with the rest that should probably tell you everything you need to know while deciding to spend 30

i have fond memories of playing galactic conquest the mode to play for hours upon hours in my ps2 days in glorious 4player splitscreen with family and friends now that my kids are old enough i was looking forward to playing star wars battlefront classic collection with them controllers were at the ready and my pc hooked up to the tv as usual

the first letdown was seeing that the game does not support more than 2 controllers who could have thought it a good idea to remove 4player splitscreen the best aspect of these oldies as i recovered from the initial shock i thought okay we might still play it in online mode using four of our pcs but then the next surprise galactic conquest is not supported online given the low level of challenge posed by the ai in these games the only reasonable way to play galactic conquest is 1v1 which completely misses the point of a largescale cooperative war

unfortunately with the developers having crippled it like that i can only recommend this version to fans of 1v1 or possibly to those who dont mind playing standalone battles only and missing out on galactic conquest for the rest of us theres no way around dusting off our old consoles if we want to experience these games in the way they were meant to be played refund requested

ps how do you bulk up two singlecd games to a 60 gb monster and for what reason prestige

#####

look at how they massacred my boy

god awful servers zero fixes of ageold problems and the control mapping is flat out broken trying to reassign a mouse button well hey heres the gamepad layout

what an absolute shambles the download file size alone was enough to give me doubt and i was right

cash grabbing zero care given port you can quite literally just play the old version still on steam and have a better time

#####

what we have here is a cash grab not worth it buy the originals their servers are still up

#####

after spending the day playing this things are getting better to the point where i can recommend the game now single player experience is great and creating a server for just my friends and i worked wonderfully as well in both battlefront 1 and 2 i will say there are still plenty of bugs to be worked out on the 64 player online games i played multiple of them and they were fun while playing but unfortunately it seemed to kick you out after each match causing you to have to rejoin but when i played at night with my friend in random lobbies we were not kicked out so that issue may have been fixed if you are buying this game for just online 64 player matches with randoms you should wait a week at least to see if that continues to improve but if you just want to play with friends and have all single player content like me you should get the game

#####

let the past die kill it if you have to

patch 1 edit

patch 1 dropped at the time of writing and ive played more of the collection since day 1 so ill update the review

this collection is still a hard pass despite the update its a huge step in the right direction dont get me wrong but theres still a lot of fundamental flaws that exist within the collection

the specularity is just dreadful and is applied to too many objects that realistically shouldnt shine like the snow platforms of mygeeto
the normals look and probably are autogenerated and almost all of them look ghastly a real attempt needs to be made on these as theyre disgusting to look at especially the rebel transport
lighting is still a huge pain for this collection too with the loss of vertex colouring and that so many overhangs and dark areas are almost fully lit
many other issues that are more easily fixed remains like rhen var and bespin using bf1 textures over the bf2 ones and various models from bf1 being used over bf2s in the dlc maps particularly additionally the medals are completely screwed and makes getting them easier but less consistent

last thing i want to bring up they still have yet to acknowledge shaymin or the usage of their mod and frustratingly are likely not going to and will instead opt to slowly and silently patch their mod out of the collection

im impressed with everything this patch updated thus far and is full of great fixes for people who are diehard for this collection i am glad that theyre doing something about it but too many issues prevent me from changing my reviews rating though patch 2 might depending on what happens between now and then and what gets updated




original review

we as star wars fans shouldve learned better after their kotor rerelease fiasco at least during that aspyr knew when to quit

heres everything wrong will be updated as i my friends and people on gametoast grognard modders who aspyr shouldve let help but viciously ghosted including shaymin who they borrowed their mod for playtesting in early beta and then refused to communicate with the entirety of that drama instead of just dispelling it outright find more

layered on top of the major issues being reported elsewhere like missing campaign cutscenes or the invariable amounts of server issues

ai upscale artifacting everywhere
abuse of specularity maps to make everything shiny for no damn reason everything has this ugly freshly cleaned gloss even shithole planets like mygeeto that are supposed to be caked in snow
uninspired achievements get the medals 4 times over for the bulk of the achievements awesome really stressing those brains there
major regressions in the ui at least for pc clunky menus to add maps and spawning is a miniature war with muscle memory
also ui overlapping in the gc menu and from the killfeed
odd pitch issues with victory music and bf1s loading screen beeps why do this 
awful font it looks like the most obese font they could nab for free why was the console font not suitable or even just the old pc one
no starfighter control inversion a lot of people agree this makes space unplayable epic 
no ai heroes from console they took the ui of console did the bare minimum to make it work for pc players and then didnt incorporate fun elements of consoles like the improved kashyyyk water or the ai heroes
unnecessary changes to dlc heroes asajjs starblades dont bounce because of all the op things in this game that required tuning that was the most important thing trust me
audio cuts out in hero assault maps did anyone even fucking playtest this how are there like 15 qa testers listed in the credits when the game launches like this
h d r  e v e r y w h e r e pc already had lighting issues where everything looked kinda washed out and overly bright this is so much worse all the moody areas are now fully bright and its hideous
jangos pistol audio doesnt play on any new hero assault map re did anyone playtest this
first person in the sbd reveals rather interestingly the second hand but why is it there why did they not remove it did anyone even notice this
when crouching and moving directionally on pc this activates a roll just like console why did they not make this behaviour platform dependent unbind your dedicated roll button it doesnt matter anymore
hero assault ai in general is a tragedy on the death star the ai either mindlessly suicides into the death barriers or gets stuck in the firing control room i know alternative gamemode ai sucks but this is another level
for hero assault hero damage values are usually buffed kit fisto and asajj ventresss are not why not
got a war hero medal before endurance somehow but only just then received the achievement for getting my first endurance medal then i finally proc endurance and get the veteran endurance achievement huh
rhen var citadel isnt the dlc version its the bf1 version the textures and lighting and map props arent like how they are in the dlc

there are so many more issues with this release than documented here this release is a travesty and aspyr will likely dump this games support after a week i wont be surprised if only a 16th of the games issues get fixed before aspyr realises this is a lost cause and were left with a 30 turd in our libraries

waited 3 weeks to have this crap on my computer 1010 will play anyway due to sunk cost fallacy

#####

this game makes me want to slit my wrist rockets

#####

yap refund and back to helldivers 2






















#####

dont buy this people who like it are living for the nostalgia to each their own
 settings are flat and there arent enough
 inverted y axis but not x when piloting things cant be changed
 cant join friends in multiplayer so youre just trying to find the same lobby
 multiplayer doesnt have a search
 no improvements on the original game you cant galactic conquest with friends
 ships in hoth using default setting on a controller cant take down the atats because you cant turn sharp enough had to crank sensitivity
ai doesnt always use vehicles for some reason
forces 15 sec cooldown on respawns which is horrible being yoda isnt worth 30 seconds of doing nothing
lobbies regularly crash after rounds
rounds are insanely short online so it makes waits way worse
the stans who wont see fault in the game are annoying as fuck

refunding this theres too much wrong for me to be ok with the cost go buy the og game because single player and the settings are already better there

#####

never left a review before but this is possibly the worst thing i have ever played 

#####

lets get the good and bad out of the way the good single player is still completely playable as it was intended back in the 2005 release but that then leads to the bad

you can literally buy and play the 2005 release you could play the classic xbox release you could play the ps2 release all of these original games have the same content gameplay wise but not graphic wise now loading in youll find some very strange stretching on the fonts a minor gripe the markers for the weapon reloads arent where theyre supposed to be graphically another minor gripe but you know whats inexcusable

you load into an aspyr dedicated server in multiplayer and when the games countdown timer to spawn you in elapses you dont spawn so you try to pick a new spawn point a new class you try to respawn anything to get you on the field of battle nothing works

you load into an aspyr dedicated server in multiplayer and your base ping is 100ms in 2024 not only that but youre getting constant connection interruptions thats inexcusable

2 strikes down here comes number 3 you load into a p2p connection via quick play and your base ping in 200ms and the connection interruptions are worse because your quickplay is either not optimized by region or the netcode was poorly written

either way three strikes and youre out im sorry aspyr if disney put you up to this if they had you crunch to release this within a certain time frame but if this had proper development time theres no excuse for the excessive amount of issues and this could have been qa tested long before release

you didnt watch out for those wrist rockets and they blew a huge hole in you man

#####

this is just sad shame on aspyr you managed to fuck up the easiest release ever dont buy this they dont deserve your money this release hurts

#####

they took the porting a little too literally and ported the dead official servers too 

but for real its somehow impressive how bad this is

#####

just did the 15gb patch bf1 loading sounds work servers seem better and more stable on both games bf2 servers seem better and the hit detection is better a good amount of the bugs were fixed i like the graphics hopefully aspyr keeps the updates coming

i wasnt impressed at launch but i am happy the developer is still making updates despite the terrible reviews and refunds yeah its not perfect but it does have working star wars battlefront online

#####

for once i can proudly say that i last longer in bed than a 64v64 conquest




fix this

#####

i mean its simple for me

aspyr broke part of this game that kept it alive for so many years mods

every custom map in bf1 will not load because the developers decided that they would rather just make everything lua 5 like swbf2 and completely break compatibility

combine that with the absolutely horrid server situation and the other bugs like random crashes dont buy this

#####

i would rather smash my balls with bricks than play this crap again

#####

how tf you gonna charge us 31 bucks and then have broken servers day of launch fix this asap so i can cure my depression already

only three dedicated servers two being hero assault aspyr genuinely wtf did you all even put effort here or did you just rip mod packs and call it a day jfc what a buzzkill

update day two after launch and all we got was a we hear you statement on networking only not the many visual and qol bugs introduced with this new port refund request in i urge everyone to do the same as the original ports hit a new record of 1k players in a long while last highest record recently was 900 of last year if i read right fuck aspyr

additional update refund accepted and bought actual functioning titles for a fraction of the price on the spring sale playercount is down to 700800 while battlefront 2 2005 sits at 480 even in early morning bf 2004 sitting at an additional 80100 safe to say if you still are trying to rationalize this pos bloatware it is dead in the water get your damn refunds

#####

game not good i depressed someone bring me joy please

#####

i got this for multiplayer and it constantly stutters controls are clunky and no inverted controls for starfighters 

wait for fixes

#####

a bigger issue than the servers right now is the lack of adequate lives in every match when you have 64 players and only 100 lives for each team the matches end in about 2 minutes flat not worth playing until they up this by at least 10x

#####

i waited all my teenage years all my adult years for this

i have watched all my friends get their childhood games remastered ported hell even just re released and it has been brilliant great decent and some not even bad

remember when people was complaining about the red dead redemption port well seems like aspyr is giving rockstar a run for their money on who can be the scummiest game dev

no effort whatsover the originals are literally less janky than this so if you buying this for the singleplayer just buy the originals they are on steam

not to mention the bait they did on the steam marketplace to make people actually think they upgraded the system they actually managed to degrade a 19 year old game that is so bad and nearly impossible thing to do that it is almost impressive

hell aspyr arnt even good at getting a money grab as most people realise how bad of a release this is within the bloody tutorial so they cant even do that right 20 minutes in and half the people that bought this game have refunded it lmao steam gives 2 hours for a refund and dw you wont even get close to the 2 hour mark before realising it deserves to be refunded im not refunding it on that delusion that aspyr actually care enough to fix all the problems which i know wont happen

and you release a game with 0 dedicated servers for battlefront 1 i got this to play my favourite battlefront 2 but still shocking and then you only give battlefront 2 3 dedicated servers what an absolute joke

me and so many people waited all our lives for this particular remake and thought it would never have happened and now that its here  we realise it took too long it missed the era of game developers actually caring about releasing full finished games it missed the era of game devs caring about re releasing old titles as finished and playable games because it actually meant something to the game devs it has unfortunately been made so late that it got made in the era of scumbag game devs doing anything for a quick cent and putting no effort into anything imagine being so lucky that you can literally make atleast 500k  on a game that got released 19 years ago and you just spit in everyones faces

i was first happy that ea had nothing to do with it but now seeing how aspyr does by themselves congrats aspyr you just named yourself as a top 6 worst game dev of all time

im not even ever going to update this review if you fix all the problems i want people to know the type of game developers you are even if you fix this trash worst release ever

#####

i only am recommending this game because i bought it for galactic conquest and solo gameplay i would not recommend for people wanting to play online multiplayer

#####

this is not the game youre looking for

#####

this is sadly a terrible effort at bringing back the classic battlefront games the multiplayer portion is barely playable thanks to some truly horrific connection issues you cant uninvert flying controls and for some reason the whole thing takes 60gb drive space when the originals take 15 ad have better quality cutscenes
just a really poor job and with aspyrs track record the chances of them improving things enough are fairly small

#####

quick cash grab from aspyr nothing more

#####

given the current state of the game it really isnt any fun lots of crashes multiplayer is not really working audio and visual glitches even the single player mode is ruined by bots that dont work properly
unfortunately youll have more fun highlighting and moving your desktop icons around


#####

single player experience is fine

#####

there are a total of 0 servers for bf1 and 2 whole dedicated servers for bf2

#####

20 year old game still broken on launch

#####

there is next to no difference for the single player experience in terms of visual clarity the only significant changes is text clarity in menus and light blur in some instances very odd that it takes up 62gb storage for nothing new added

comparing the originals side by side to this release is a joke this is merely a console port for both games to pc as defined by the ui in 2 there is mild sharpness applied in quality it was known that the only intention was to use ai upscaling for textures but holy shit did it fall shorter than i thought

keeping this in mind it is clear the main selling point for anyones interest in purchasing this clear cash grab was for revamp in the multiplayer servers which was an abhorrent disappointment region locked server host capped to 30fps
3 dedicated servers for au in bf1 wtf

crazy if you want to play an instant action privately with your friends the host is locked to 30 fps may as well pull out the old analog tv and rca av connections as you will have a more fluid experience playing the original game on original hardware then whatever the fuck i experienced in my 30mins online absolute janky snapping screen mess
the amount of bugs introduced in this port is atrocious

if actual care was given to make a remaster instead of a recycle the company to do that successfully would have such a huge backing of support it would be nuts but we got this garbage 20 years and no one has yet been able to replicate the enjoyment from the originals even when using them as the direct source if there is no statement by aspyr within the day and resolution attempt within the week i see no interest in waiting for change and will refund indefinitely as the game does not uphold to what was advertised in the slightest

day 2 edit
server region lock really shows itself for au 40ms server ping ethernet nbn fttp 240mbps in sydney
bf1 has 1 server with 0 players in server list
bf2 has only 14 players in a space battle all other servers dead
single player bugs abundant and new bugs exist that were not in the originals so cant even play single player without issue 
there is no reason for au players to own this game and aspyr statement release for acknowledging the failures of release only addressed server instability and their intention to increase network infrastructure for such a huge error and petty small statement that doesnt answer the plethora of queries or clarify the region lock and error of single player experience why should i ever own this game when its only reason for purchase doesnt function and if it ever does get resolved will be too late for any hype of experience

this release brought attention to me about the prior star wars rereleases by aspyr and there is no reason to trust any future recycled garbage produced by aspyr

#####

ive played bf1 religiously for 20 years and what theyve done is something not even god can forgive

also nobody will read this so  suck a hot fart out of my tight ass aspyr

#####

a really really disappointing port and awful multiplayer release aspyr has given me zero hope for the kotor remakeremaster

#####

all you had to do was sell me the same game with minimal upscaling and working servers pathetic

#####

i dont need to contribute to the waves of specific complaints and bugs needless to say the game is in a horrible condition at the moment and with uncredited work being used and the developers lying about it i couldnt in good conscience support this release buggybad launches happen but the lack of communication and outright lies pushed me over the edge to my first ever refund on steam

they just released an update today as of writing 31924 which seems to address alot of the issues and that is promising but i am going to keep my money for now update 2 is supposedly in the works and depending on how that turns out i may change my review and buy the game again

if they fix this disaster of a game if they credit the people whose work they legally i understand that they technically are allowed to use modified code but with permission immorally used and they commit to the game and own up to their mess i will gladly repurchase and play the game i want this to be good it has so much potential but as it stands this is unacceptable

#####

would rather buy winrar

#####

please dont waste money on this absolutely botched job lacking basic control adjustments that were in the original galactic conquest mode is legitimately unplayable navigation issues that soft lock runs for myself and my friends and servers that are honestly just terrible go buy the original much cheaper and a better product

#####

a trained ape could write better netcode if any was written at all and not just kept from the original port how many terrible star wars battlefront releases must we suffer before someone competent gets the ip

please quit making games close your studio and get a job as a plumber because youre top at peddling shit

#####

ruined the loading screen zoom sound for battlefront 1
010

#####

just buy the classic versions and install graphics mods it will look and run much better without taking up 60gb of space multiplayer only reason i got this version is unplayable what a shame

#####

bf2 has no multiplayer on release bf1 multiplayer has no servers available under 150 ping the mouse input feels like ass and it looks like they just ported the game over with no intentions of upgrading or smoothing any of the bumps out 

this is a cash grab dont buy and if you did refund game devs need to put out actual products

#####

the 501st legion disapproves

#####

i feel lied to  there was no effort put into this whatsoever  my group was counting down the last hour before the game allowed us to install it  and then we couldnt play  and then when we did get to play there were so many technical issues that the game wasnt enjoyable  what in the hell did we do to deserve this

#####

if you pay an extra 5 and 8 gigabytes of storage you could play helldivers 2 instead

#####

i can forgive all of the sins this game has made all of them if they didnt take out the fucking  501st journal missions outros like why the hell would you do that the 501st journal is one of the best parts about this game and they just cut the outros out in favor of cutscenes from the movie

#####

h1this game requires more space than battlefront 2015 with all dlc installedh1

it actually feels embarrassing to have assumed the devs would do a decent job at porting 2 games that were already available on pc but even crazier they managed to make it 63 goddamn gigabytes genuinely how is that even possible

urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmgyar2ssbkabattlefront 2015 5227 gburl  urlhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmlfdcofulqybattlefront classic collection 6287url
go ahead please humor me with which game visually you think should be bigger in file size

#####

grade a nostalgia bait

#####

i cant believed they botched it this bad cant battlefront fans catch a break

#####

paying customers are not allowed to have a good currentdecade multiplayer star wars game even if they fix this absolute travesty if they ever do people will leave or have already left because its recycled content anyway the level of incompetence demonstrated so far is astonishing aspyr has no one to blame but themselves

i am willing to revisit this if the insane lag connection issues postgame lag and hanging sound issues buggy menus missing optionscontrols that were already in the game are addressed

#####

this game is bantha poodoo play the originals instead

#####

unplayable worse servers than the original which had to be salvaged from a service that doesnt exist anymore completely unacceptable state this release in needed another 5 months

#####

i never got a chance to experience battlefront 2 online back in 2005
and i thought this would be the perfect time to experience it with 64 players
boy was i wrong 

fuck you aspyr
dont buy this bullshit

#####

shame there are mods that do way more and do it better for free
there is some cool stuff but for this price kind of a joke

i hope this gets more love and fixes so i can consider buying it again in the future

#####

i went over the time in single player having some of the memories flood back from when the game actually was complete now i cannot get a refund even though this was clearly a scummy scam cash grab i am the idiot for not stopping after 2 hours will continue to ask for refunds this game is ass dont purchase let my stupidity turn you away from making a bad decision

#####

oh boy where to even start why was this even released when both of the old games are on steam and theres barely any difference between the two
not to mention this collection is 62 gb to install for some insane reason while 1 and 2 of the original are 3 gb and 9 gb by themselves and i cant see any graphics or texture upgrades at all

game is not worth it at this point too many server issues and the game feels lame maybe if the developer says anything by tomorrow ill reconsider refunding this as of right now i am ready to request a refund tomorrow

#####

region locked servers literally cant play with my friends

#####

do not buy this game  this collection could have been amazing  i like everyone else here probably imagined playing some awesome multiplayer on our steam decks with updated graphics  
1  forget updated graphics for some reason the game takes up a ton of hard drive space yet the graphics are xbox like when i say xbox i mean the first xbox not xbox one the first xbox 

2 ok so the publishers dont care about the community and didnt spend any time upgrading the graphics but the multiplayer will make up for it right   wrong  you cant even get into a multiplayer game  i think part 1 only has 3 servers for over 10000 players  good luck trying to get in a game  i just put in for a refund i bought the game yeesterday and have 14minutes of total gameplay because it kept crashing 

hopefully steam gives me a refund

#####

imagine taking a beloved classic and turning it into ai slop garbage while making absolutely zero improvements but multiple downgrades

networking is shit and barely works
30 fps cap in multiplayer
bloated file size because of ai upscaling memes
garbage console ui
no crossplay
broken audio
missing cutscenes

this is disrespectful of pandemic studios legacy feels like spitting on their grave
thank you aspyr

just buy the originals and mod them

#####

we aint making it out of tatooine with this one

#####

this was not like the simulations

#####

dont

#####

there are a lot of bugs and issues sprinting feels weird throwing a grenade locks you out of your weapon for way too long losing your ship in galactic conquest doesnt let you spawn a new one some of the uiux stuff in game is gc menus is strange and intuitive 

i rather just play the og bfii game

#####

not cross platformripso i cant play with xbox or playstation billiesbecause

#####

seems they also opted for the 2005 server experience to preserve the accuracy of the port

#####

update changes are being implemented incrementally more to follow

pros
models have improved texture resolution
frame rate isnt worse than the 2005 version

cons
movement is mixed in responsiveness 
slopes excessively reduce movement speed when sprinting 
crouching requires animation completion prior to toggling again 
cannot break out of crouch with sprint
remapping controls can remove their responsiveness so neither of the swapped buttons work
game audio lags significantly from action or cuts entire portions
flight control tied to mouse movement rather than screen position meaning you need to repeatedly drag across your mouse pad just to turn
60 required gigabytes of space the originals were 2 and 9 gigs tops

somehow they did an objectively worse port than the 2005 versions like how how do you screw this up aspyr this should have been a layup and you botched spectacularly

#####

i felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror i fear something terrible has happened the battlefront classic collection has been released

#####

ez refund

#####

youll laugh youll cry youll kiss 3501 goodbye
unless you steam refund 

also why the penny

#####

lazy cash grab aspyr is accused of stealing mods from the old game and using them without credit

#####

httpsyoutubena180_rkab4

 menu is pulled from the console versions which is vastly less responsive for pc good luck making a instant action playlist
 no expanded options such as audio configuration bloom and inverting flight axis
 mouse controls feel floaty and the hero 3rd person camera feels nauseating probably emulating analogic input with mouse
 63gb for a collection of 12gb games likely used ai upscaling for textures  some nice material effects
 unplayable multiplayer from unavailable servers to rubberbanding to colossal lag

this is a hard sell if it was a free mod for 35 then

just dont bother this is a scam of criminal proportions and aspyr most definitely wont ever fix this mess to acceptable levels

just like the simulations after a jawa chopped up the main servers for sale

#####

what an l of a launch my hopes and dreams were just crushed

#####

60gb there is absolutely no reason why this should be 60gb youre essentially getting an hd texture pack better lighting higher draw distance and native gamepad support thats it as others have said the multiplayer is also broken just dont bother stick with the original versions

#####

horrible how do you fuck something up this badly the developers should be ashamed

#####

this is mainly gonna be me focusing on bf2 all i can say is for now it isnt worth your time or money especially when the ogs are still around and far far far cheaper and modifiable there are glitches in this that arent in the original like how the pilots dont repair the fighter for like a few seconds then get a insta repaired and get deafened by a loud noise the tie bombers bombs dont appear sometimes the audio peaks sometimes for no reason i know this is like the definitive versions becuase of hero assault being on all the maps and xbox dlc now being brought over but those can be done by modding the og in case if anyone is wondering about graphical options there isnt much only resolution change options you have are windowed or full screen thats it idk about the online multiplayer and tbh i dont much care get the original games they are moddable smaller in file size and wont hurt your ears from glitchy audio

also if you want to build another fleet in galactic conquest good luck i deselected the fleet and clicked on another system i conqured and it just reslected the fleet already built

#####

laggy servers weird aiming broken audio missing cutscenes janky galactic conquest menus no inverted flight control etc

a shame as this collection has integrated controller support and splitscreen unlike the original steam version

save your money and dont buy this collection until aspyr fixes their mess

#####

cashgrab 70gig install requirement for games that released on the ps2 mods are broken multiplayer broken no workshop support no field of view settings ui font typography doesnt match the originals bf1 loading screen sound isnt right no video settings in bf1 despite them being present in the original release no multiplayer crossplay no 4 player splitscreen like the og xbox version if this were a from the ground up remaster they could charge this price but not in it current state

#####

how did they drop the ball this hard 
all they had to do was have decent multiplayer functionality and have online galactic conquest
how do they not have online galactic conquest are you kidding me 
i know it wasnt in the main game but its honestly a no brainer easy refund wtf aspyre

#####

oh hell naw

#####

i wouldnt care about the technical issues if this didnt take up as much space as a current year game

#####

still not as bad as rise of skywalker

#####

womp womp

#####

as someone who played a lot of battlefront 2 on ps2 im disappointed that bf2 in the classic collection looks like a 11 port of the ps2 version with all the limitations from the console while we have the old classic version on steam for 13 the price which is much better suited to the actual pc this pains me because i spent countless hours playing on console loving every minute of the game in short if i want to play a collection of classics ill fire up an aged ps2 and have a better performing game than here

#####

this is where the fun begins
wait no it doesnt

#####

i felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced i fear something terrible has happened

#####

do not buy this game twenty years to remake or port the game to newgen and they release an actual mess for this price

#####

i was worried about the state of this game from some of the preview videos i saw and the opening batch of reviews and you should seriously heed them before buying this with functional releases of these 20 year old games available for far cheaper i wouldnt even bother with these until aspyr can address serious issues pertaining to server stability ptp connections ai problems and the fact old splitscreen modes cannot be played online for whatever reason this is a massive disappointment to put it lightly

#####

paid 25 for a ps2 game that is worse than the ps2 game 
server issues
100 tickets per match
controller support is nonexistent 
buggy menus 

horrendous 

save your money

#####

multiplayer is a mess rn but i prefer to play solo anyways i love these games

#####

scam the launch of this game was so buggy and illprepared that the original 2005 battlefront 2 is more active than this was hoping the 30 would at least net me a more active multiplayer but rip singleplayer isnt better than the originals in any noticeable regards and anything that is improved can be done with mods without the extreme price tag and 70 gb bloatlord that is ai upscaled textures

dont even bother for achievements because the marshal commander achievement for getting all the other ones is bugged so you cant get it and 100 the game

#####

we got into a game very quickly so thats not an issue

what is an issue is the lack of justification not for the price point but for its existence
aside from consolidating a handful of mods into the game and upscaling the pixelated graphics so that theyre less pixelated theres nothing going on that saves the game from being so basic

but the worst part is the upscaling the reason this is 80gb is because theyve lazily gone and upscaled the resolution of all the textures which sounds cool but it only means that you can zoom up the image without it becoming more pixelated basically itll just look the same on your new monitor as the original did on an older monitor which you know thats fine but its lazy because ai upscaling game textures doesnt automatically mean that the game will work with it and there are plenty of bugs that show that the developers did not try to fix the problems they created by doing this

theres no heart or love from the devs to try and bring this to a modern audience theyre just trying to make an old game look passable on a modern screen

#####

broken dead game very much a disappointing scam

#####

people were in for a rude awakening with just how bad this games netcode and server stability is 

its worse than ever dont get me wrong but it was always bad and nobody shouldve expected it to be any different in terms of multiplayer this game has never played well in mp horrible tick rate netcode stability host issues god awful balance etc etc etc

the thing i cannot fathom is how the singleplayer content is worse the kbm controls are worse than the original pc games forced mouse acceleration its definitely emulating a controller on pc sound will randomly cut out or change volume they didnt fix the one line of code preventing ki adi mundi from having voice lines that modder fixed over a decade ago and somehow the ai feels worse than before which i didnt think was possible 

beyond multiplayer which i knew would be genuinely unplayable because this game has always had unplayably bad multiplayer this is just a flat worse version than the originals yeah its visually cleaner but mods can make it better than this with the ogs 

be happy they didnt delist the originals this collection aint it

#####

to say i am sad and angry with this game is a serious understatementyou had one jobjust make it more accessible on modern hardware with live servers that we could all have fun in i can never find more than 2 servers with people in them and its always under 10 even if all the issues are fixed it will never recover from this abysmal launch

maybe one day we will get an excellent battlefront againeveryone go play the modern battlefront 2 its still fun and i havent  had issues finding games the last few weeksat least keeping that alive will give us the battlefront kick we needfor now

#####

this was suppose to be a easy homerun since the og games

instead 
the filesize is huge for no reason 60gb
the servers are shitting themself 
there are less option control than the original
audiologs are broken
the price is 35 eur

#####

these games were already on steam
the only point of this version was multiplayer support
the multiplayer does not work

#####

tldr there was zero effort put into this collection and even if it was bug free i dont believe it would be worth the asking price

let me give you some context these two games are my favorite games of all time i remember crying after playing battlefront 2 for the first time because i didnt have a console that could run it at home a year later i received a copy and a ps2 and swear i played them for the next 48 hours without stopping since then i have picked up almost every version of this game pc ps2 and xbox so i know them pretty well

playing the game on my steamdeck the day after launch i must admit i was able to find a game somewhat easily and that i didnt encounter nearly as many bugs as most people had however i did encounter plenty of issues first thing i noticed there were no official servers with aim assist so if i wanted to play multiplayer with full lobbies on my steamdeck i would struggle the alternative was to play on non official servers however these are not nearly as active next i attempted on playing the new bf2 maps brought over from the xbox dlc and i noticed that the ai wouldnt really do all that much they just kind of stood around i then attempted playing on the base maps and the ai appeared to behave normally then i had an issue playing instant action where it would not let me select a team lastly i attempted to play bf1 it would crash everytime i tried to launch a game multiplayer or single player i attempted this three times before giving up i did manage to hear the broken loading sound noise why change that all of these issues i encountered in 25 minutes of playtime

this collection just feels rushed and i dont understand why it was only just announced a few weeks ago what was the hurry why not take extra time to actually finish it if they had waited until may 4th star wars day to release it that would have given them plenty of time to address the issues it had in the state it is now it feels like no one had even tested it when this game launched last night there were apparently only three 64 player servers live for the nearly 10000 players who logged on why did we forget what day we were launching

and let me abruptly switch to my main point even if this games launch went flawlessly and there were no bugs or multiplayer issues i cant say that it would be a better value than buying the two original games at least on pc the quality of life improvements they made were extremely minimal the best change they made was replacing the bf2 pc menu with the console version which is nice and it was nice to add the dlc maps and characters and bring heroes and villians to all maps ignoring that the ai is broken on maps like the death star  but i feel like these three things are no brainers the ai textures really arent worth the space they take up the ui font has changed to something ugly and generic looking and they removed control options the original games are 10 each you can buy them both for 20 and have a less buggy and more authentic experience why does this cost more

#####

how do you mess this up easiest slam dunk ever and they botched it

#####

for 35 magic beans you know damn well i was going to get my moneys worth out of this garbage dont even think about buying this just go grab the original and save yourself 30 beans and 50gb of hard drive space

#####

i got like 38 fps i dont like it

#####

server quantity fixed needs ping improvements now just needs to have ticket count raised in mp matches then its pretty good inverted axis can be fixed so can swbf2 peertopeer host fps issue 90 of mods work with one or two tweaks to the files if any

edit fixed most mp lag ticket count and axis fixed hit detection still iffy but no more severe rubberbanding or disconnects og swbf2 mp is 100x more laggier ironically and only a couple decently populated onessame as swbfc

#####

they somehow unfinished a finished game impressive

#####

refunded the game after it released in a broken state without inverted view controls

now that theyve fixed that and numerous other issues i could conceivably buy it again but the discount from owning the original games is used up and gone for me

so basically now ill just wait around until the game goes on deep discount and maybe think about getting it again and who knows if there will be any multiplayer player base at all by then

all of this could have been avoided if they spent 2 more months on the game before shoving it out the door

#####

what a disgrace to the legacy of these legendary games

#####

whopping grand total of 3 servers in battlefront 2

battlefront 1 has no servers

#####

if this hit detection is canon to star wars i understand why stormtroopers cant hit anything

#####

womp womp

#####

how do you fumble a rerelease of a 20 year old game so hard

 uncompressed aiupscaled textures
 0 improvements and changes to base games
 no crossplay

#####

surely it wont be so hard to release some updated versions of ps2 games to modern platforms i say having learned nothing from the metal gear master collection

surely

i dont know how they managed to do it but its so bad you can barely rebind keys

#####

why would you ruin the iconic loading sound from battlefront 1 just disgraceful

edit latest update fixed the issue above and many others

#####

in summary this remake feels like nothing more than a moneygrab if youre seeking a modern star wars battlefront experience either mod the original games or opt for the ea version the price theyre asking for this remake is unjustifiable considering its lackluster quality

to save you time i recommend purchasing the superior 2005 version available on steam

comparatively the changes made here are minimal unlike the substantial changes seen in aspyrs kotor 2 tsl patch which was offered for free

having spent more time ingame here are my candid observations

 the remake exhibits numerous texture flaws throughout the environment notably visible around command posts on geonosis
 maps featuring vehicles suffer from poor vehicle mobility getting stuck on terrain is a frequent frustration on felucia mygeeto geonosis and utapau a problem absent in the original game
 some mods seem to have been directly ported into the game evident from bugs like ventress lightsabers and vaders glitched running animation
 this version is plagued with more bugs than the originals ranging from sound issues to gameplay glitches like having 2 of the same bonus item both getting consumption in conquest mode when used once and the inability to disable inverted movement
 the lack of online servers at launch coupled with the absence of crossplay though this was already announced is a significant letdown modded servers for the original battlefront 2 offer better stability and performance
 disappointingly the textures in this remake are inferior to mods available for the original games considering the size of the game file its disappointing that the modded version of battlefront 2 offers a vastly superior experience with only half the file size

#####

ive never been so disappointed and disrespected

#####

one of the biggests fumbles in gaming history this was free money

#####

tldr avoid this game and just buy the 2004 and 2005 pc versions that still up on steam for 10 each and youll not only save money but have a better time

to preface this review i preordered this game to get the loyalty discount so my cost of this sad excuse of a port was 28 even so this game is worth more like 5 in its current state aspyr is continuing to show they are not capable of handling the simple process of porting a 20 year year old game to modern day pc i dont know if its lack of funding care staffing etc but this game is worse than when i played it all those years ago this really has me worried about the kotor remaster they are working on

i wanted to play online but there are unlike the posts from aspyr there dont seem to be a massive influx of players who cant play like hell divers 2 was experiencing a few weeks ago this game is more of a ghsot town as of this posting there were only 5 servers for battlefront 2 and only 3 of them had players and even then the player counts were 

2  64  bespin platforms
2  64  bespin platforms
4  64  tatooine mos eisley

there were also 2 completely empty servers for battlefront 1 it was slightly better in that there actually seemed to be a server with people playing 

2  64  rhen var harbor
5  64  mos eisley
17  64  mustafar
1  64  kamino

there were about 6 or 7 more servers that were empty 

soak that in this review is on a sunday afternoon march 17 of launch weekend and the game is a ghost town but according to steam dbsteam charts there are 1952 players playing right now wellwhere are they maybe they are trying to get their 1 hour and 59 minutes of single player time in before refunding the game cause i gave it about 30 minutes and now im applying for a refund 

the battlefront and pc gaming community deserves than this sad pile of bantha poo doo

#####

dogsht

#####

the good
runs natively on linux i run arch as a daily driver but im sure it would work on the steam deck too
2 games 1 seamless launcher
higher refresh rates
fov slider

the bad
windowed does not work
no inverted
only 3 servers at launch

the ugly
loading sound is borked
only inverted in starfighters
game starts in full screen then attempts to change when you select a profile
can only bind mouse button 4 wont detect mb 5 

this is only 1015 min of playing  dont buy this nostalgia bait just yet wait till it gets fixed for save you hard earned money for a good game

#####

just buy the old one

#####

no modern game devs know how to game design all they know is raceswap character models bloat file size undersupport multiplayer servers and lie


jokes aside the games are fun but not for anything added in the update theyre fun because pandemic made good games almost 20 years ago

#####

this is a borderline scam im hopeful that they fix it because i wanted it for the steam deck but this is an atrocious launch

#####

this isnt where the fun begins

#####

this was not like the simulations

#####

literally worse in every single way than the 2005 version especially the ui how did you fail to improve the menus in a 2024 rerelease of a game from 2005 that still works on modern systems with a bit of elbow grease i wont lie

#####

how the fuck is there no option to invert the y axis thats basic shit i cant even play now

#####

if you have a 3440x1440 monitor the hud will be broken and stretched alot of sounds are broken menu is clunky obviously meant for consoles not for pc

#####

so disappointed with the quality of collection its honestly unacceptable to launch something in this state i had to look up a launch command that locks my framerate to 120 while hosting otherwise you get constant stuttering there are so many issue with this release its so disappointing was looking forward to this and maybe if they fix it i will buy it again but at this point we need to send a message that this whole launch now fix later mindset is not okay

late is just for a little while suck is forever

#####

why is there no option for invert can we get an update

#####

grenade simulator 2024 i am the best sniper on the world i was rank 1 on original star wars battlefront sniper leaderboards for 17 years and i cant hit a shot on game cuz bad net codes and rubber band i would be destroying all u kids if it wasnt for bad game lel p needless to say ill see you noobs on og battlefront 2 watch out for me xd

#####

dont falsely advertise multiplayer

#####

an irony how a 20 year old game is still not finished
anyway i got my refund hopefully theyll fix the game in the future

#####

somehow made a 20 year old game worse

#####

quotebiyou never get a second chance to make a first impressionibquote

i have played the original titles on playstation 2 since they released in 2004  2005 i personally feel that this collection doesnt offer any compelling reasons to play over the originals

the rushed launch of this title is disappointing because it annihilated the multiplayer count having a thriving community helps to overlook the many issues that the game has but now that is gone and it will be tough to convince anyone to come back

in multiplayer i was experiencing a glitch on every death where the camera would go haywire qa testing is usually done to find weird edge cases and unexpected behaviors if a glitchbug has a 100 hit rate it really shows how much care and detail went into this release

#####

a big cash grab i hope these mfs burn in hell for this

#####

im not sure how you manage to release a game that was finished 20 years ago in an unfinished state

#####

execute order 66 on these braindead nostalgic gamers  emperor asspyr palpatine


and btw it is still miles better than rise of skywalker

#####

60 gigs for a game that in no way has been remastered and no servers

#####

tldr developer needs to aspyr to do better 

disappointing and lazy launch i was hoping to replace the xbox emulator of the same games but the splitscreen is only for 2 players not 4 as seen in the original games servers support is lacking as well in the multiplayer i also dont understand why the game is so large in size with no clear graphical update 

it is helpful that they added controller support but it doesnt justify the price premium over the pc nor emulated versions i hope they update the game and provide better support now that it is released

#####

star wars battlefront 2 is one of my favourite games ever but this rerelease is nothing but garbage the only thing it offers at this moment in time is full controller support  better hd looking graphics the singleplayer and galactic conquest work just fine but those alone arent enough for the 30 price point

so far the main complaints  

constant crashes
60gb install size
invisible walls mainly battlefront 1
ai 
the multiplayer 

the multiplayer was the main selling point for this rerelease 64 player battles with dedicated servers 
its a desync mess with hit boxes that barely exist battlefront 2 matches last just under 5 minutes long up the ticket count after each game you will most likely be kicked out due to losing connection to the host
good luck trying to host a private game for you and your buddies as it caps your game at an eyesore 30fps
edit theres a fix to host the game at 120fps right click the game properties and in launch options paste tps 120

theres no doubt updates will come along to fix these issues but relaunching a game thats nearly 20 years old in this state is disrespectful aspyr stop handling star wars ips

#####

another 2024 bangerwe need another video game crash

#####

i can only recommend this game if you are only interested in the single player experience and reliving some classic battlefront nostalgia without worrying about compatibility and mods then this game is for you it just works but right now you are paying a premium for that this was a blast to play on the steam deck compared to last playing a battlefront game on the psp back in the day

most reviews have issues with the price and how online and multiplayer was handled and these are fair points the game also requiring 70gb to play is pretty absurd online seems dead from comments but while initially that sounded fun and was hyped for it building up to the games release single player modes were all i was interested in

if you have an issue with the price the game will inevitably be on sale in the future so wait until then as the original games have been out near 20 years already and are much cheaper

#####

dookie

#####

66 gigs for barely improved textures wide screen and controller support

matches end so quickly that ive spent more time watching loading screens than playing the default settings on the dedicated servers are not where they should be

rather than make one complete package this is just the two games split by a launcher with no crossplay that fractures the player base significantly

first person weapon views havent been updated for the new resolutions leaving big holes in them with certain weapons

hit registration is all over the place

battlefront 1 has no team balancing in place and you cant see how many people are on either team before picking

this is the bare minimum of a review much like this is the bare minimum of a rerelease

#####

i dont normally do this but this sucks i was hyped for this game on release i stayed up and went out of my day expecting a rocky start i simply cannot connect to bf2 server and there is no bf1 servers at all no biggie ill play skirmish the controls and settings are garbage sensitivity no matter what i tried feels off random acceleration on mouse and keyboard its not good guys refunded i would repurchase the game if it got better it offenders nothing more if not less then the bf2 title that was already released

#####

multiplayer is essentially down so i decided to play single player galactic conquest is bugged and broken on not only the tactical side but also the ai on elite cant figure out where command posts are at times cant skip turns skip on using bonuses or create a ship if one is destroyed or if you want an extra one tried changing controls and you can change them in the menu but the controls then become inoperable after the changes were saved bf1 has no issues with this bc there are no ships biggest scam this month they knew they were going to get money from people who wanted to relive their childhood memories and put minimal effort into it couldnt even recreate the og sounds in the menus also the ui is obnoxiously small for the fact that you have so much space on the screen but decide to put all of the selections at the bottom mushed up together if you still have the 2005 edition on steam the multiplayer at least works there so dont buy and even if they do eventually fix these issues they just scammed everyone here no reason to buy or repurchase this joke

#####

cash grab literally just mod the originals its free plus they somehow managed to release an unfinished game thats been finished for 20 years

#####









       quality of the game





#####

the creation of the star wars battlefront classic collection is nothing more than a shameless cash grab by aspyr even if the game launched with complete success and no issues it inst worth more than 20 maximum also to the 1 of people who bought the game and are enjoying the story mode saying the game is worth getting because of that half of the cut scenes are missing between battles literally half of the narrative is missing for no reason this game also has a huge problem if you use an ultra wide screen you are forced to play in the largest screen size your monitor uses you cant change the screen size to 169 in settings so a lot of the ui on screen you cant ever click on because your stuck in ultra wide forever

#####

money grab unfortunately dont buy it

#####

having played the originals and even ran competitive ladders for them i was super hyped for this game the multiplayer is just terrible hit reg is massively broken and most shots dont even register matches end after about 5mins and then the server kicks you at the end of each round

hopefully they fix the issues but i would recommend people to save their money and wait to see if aspyr fixes them before buying it

have already put in a request to refund it

#####

honestly just buy the original games 17 overall for them cheaper and better without the bugs this remaster is not worth close to the price you have to pay for them as its an absolute cluster and is just here to run off with your money sound bugs that nearly made me deaf matches ending within 4 minutes useless ai that doesnt have a clue what its doing how the hell do you even mess that up when the original was fine and just a straight mess with network issues and more once more dont buy this mess buy the original games separate for cheaper

#####

the singleplayer works kinda good and the ui actually scales properly unlike the old versions  but the multiplayer is actually probably one of the most broken releases in a while weirdly enough the game works better on my switch than my fairly powerful pc

#####

tragic launch just play the originals dont waste your time with this repackaged game for 30 and 60gb

#####

this port is so bad 

its already bad enough the file size for the collection is 60 gigs because of the uncompressed ai upscaled textures but the multiplayer barely works at all 

instantly theres already audio bugs with bf2 being much quieter than 1 even at max volume settings  as well as the loading screen sound from bf1 when loading into a map being incorrect which is a sin

first few experiences of me playing this game started with me in bf1 doing quick join and joining a server requiring a password next match directly after that has me join a match and the game instantly crashes 

then i try bf2 quick match and end up on a match in utapau on conquest the hit reg is terrible despite having my ping only being around 40 on the server and there was a glitch that me and several other people in the server experienced where when we on a respawn timer it would just be stuck at 1 and never would go down 

the new textures and graphical changes dont look very bad and i like the upscaled hud and everything but the background cut scenes on battlefront 2s menu that are upscaled look so horrible 

im so disappointing because i love these two games but im gonna have to refund it because this is ridiculous for a 30 dollar collection that really doesnt have anything better than the original games on pc ill probably only pick it up again on discount if the biggest issues are fixed

#####

originals are better do not purchase this game

#####

forewarning at the time of this review i have returned the game 

this game is a huge drop for aspyr no inversion controls at all with features missing from the original battlefronts the latency and rubber banding in any game is horrible 

do not get it for almost half the price you can go get both originals and with a little modding play on fan servers that have far better features and connections

#####

how do you not map the keys to keyboard for galactic conquest specifically the mode is completely unplayable because you cant build more fleets unless your playing with a controller madness

#####

pure cash grab

#####

stay away from this game until the servers are fixed but if youre here for singleplayer then go ahead im seriously disappointed i guess ill never learn my lesson from preordering games lmao

#####

rereleased the same 20 year old games for 35 changed nothing 3 pc servers with 30 fps multiplayer zero reason to buy this over the 510 og versions disgraceful man

#####

three servers on launch what were you thinking i mean really and only one is conquest how low effort can you get totally unacceptable

#####

bad and ugly console ui hud is buggy on ultrawide resolution2560x1080 only a few other resolutions are available in graphics settingsno standard 1920x1080 for me
upgraded games take much more disk space than original ones for nothing some shaders and lightings on maps are broken

#####

the fk man how did you fk this up how

#####

a disappointing collection

1we have console ui and that makes selecting classes much slower compared to original pc versionchanging options is also harder

2multiplayer doesnt work correctly

3there are bugssound issues some cutscenes are misssing game likes to crash some say you cant create a new fleet in glactic conquest

4no way to reverse updown for flight controlsa feature that original pc versions had

aspyr messed up force unleashed 12 pc portsswitch port of kotor 2 and now this new collection dont hire aspyr for another remaster 

edit and the game might crash in any modean issue that was in original versions which i hoped they fix in this
i will refund since aspyr doesnt have a good postlaunch support

#####

bugs stutters and crashes galore how can a 20 year old game play this badly the servers are clunky with shocking ping shots and saber hits do not register accurately at all and the servers feel empty at times this feels like we were lied to

#####

game made me want to take my anger out on some younglings

#####

ai up scaled everything absolute slop with no effort whatsoever to remaster anything

#####

the hit detection really makes you feel like a stormtrooper

#####

right click on battlefront collection on steam and type tps 120 it will change the servers tick ratefps to whatever you put in i hated on the game earlier cause when i hosted lan it locked the fps at 30 but now i can change it super easy console players are most likely stuck at 30fps when hosting though

update they have released a patch that has fixed a lot of the issues in just a few days and announced a 2nd patch will release soon fixing even more issues this game might actually be really good guys when it is fixed i implore players to give it another go it is after all the best star wars game ever in my opinion i wish the game hadnt released in such a messy state but with a little tlc it can become better than the originals unless mod support is completely broken which i heard it might bestill its definitely more stable for self hosted servers and lan than the original

#####

just like the simulations

if the simulation was smashing your c with a hammer

#####

worst atrocity since order 66

#####

awful controller support

#####

why is this game like this hitting preorder records and tada this sht

#####

disappointing hope they fix the issues

#####

if you refund this game you can purchase every battlefront game and still have money left over

#####

dont buy right now for sure buy the originals its cheaper anyway

#####

the only reason to buy this over the originals is for a functioning multiplayer and they couldnt even do that right

#####

only played for singleplayer and its eons better than the original release on steam controls are less clunky and game definitely runs better

baffling how this couldve been a home run if the devs just took one second to critically assess their port and fix any issues with servers before release

#####

how is it worse than the same game that was released almost 20 years ago

terrible desync players and tanks teleport around
for 10 aud you can get both the classic games off g2a and have the samebetter experience

pathetic cash grab and i hope these people never attempt a battlefront 3 because they will destroy that dream

 refunding game is not worth the price will wait until its on sale

#####

what the hell is this i expected it to be a bit more than a title screen that led you to one of the two games

the game is 60gb when bf1 is 3gb and bf2 is 4gb
i am disconnected from server after every match the servers in general are super laggy
games spazzes out after dying in general just a ton of bugs
setting keyboard controls is awful and the default controls are so bad youre going to have to reset them
2 player split screen coop the original had 4
ui is clunky and not made for keyboard and mouse
there is no windowed mode

please fix this game dont let it die like this

#####

how the hell do you manage to make a 20 year old game run and play worse when you updated the engine and even messed up the ui with comic sans level fonts and missing cutscenes and horrible online performance for most players i was one the lucky few to have a playable experience i will be refunding most likely soon

#####

so bad refunded just play 2005 instead

#####

these are not the games youre looking for

#####

this is a disappointing effort for a 30 remaster i tested the game out for about a halfhour between private servers and some of aspyrs dedicated servers i was unable to load into the next match after a match was completed i had to exit the server and reconnect to spawn the respawn menu will visually glitch out like the screen is spinning around quickly battlefront 2 has terrible netcode i was seeing players rubberbanding all over the screen and my shots would not connect with enemies the audio randomly cuts out and does not fix itself until the game is restarted do not buy this until aspyr brings this game to a playable state

#####

ill rebuy for 10 on sale for the achievements

they did not put a single ounce of work into this game to fix any of the original games issues some of those issues have been made worst by their lack of care

#####

changed sensitivity and the whole game crashed

#####

some executive really saw this and went yeah 35 seems about right

#####

they broke a game that was already perfect how

edit 4424 cant even find a match now

#####

listen im not one to hop on a hate bandwagon i really wanted to enjoy this rerelease and i was so excited for it since i practically grew up playing this game on ps2 i woke up today to news that it was plagued with issues but i ignored these reports until i could get my hands on it myself when i finally got home from my classes i fire up the game and attempt to play bf2 online and what a dumpster fire that experience was 

my experience with this games online went like this i view the server list and choose the server with the lowest ping 130 and take a deep breath hoping to god that its not as bad as people say it is i load in choose my class and spawn in about one minute of the laggiest and jankiest online play ive ever experienced goes by and the game ends i queue into the next game expecting it to last longer since i joined the last game kinda late that game lasts 2 minutes 

i then switch over to bf1 to see if that one is any better but it proved to be much worse minimum of 200 ping for the official servers unplayable lagfest and to top it off my game crashed while loading into the next match 

for context i am a 25 year old star wars manbaby you could practically jingle lightsabershaped keys in my face and i would be having the time of my life i had minimal hopes for this collection literally all i cared about was playing my favorite games from my childhood online and yet they still let me the drooling star wars manbaby down what a lazy attempt at cashing in on peoples nostalgia

please avoid this collection completely if not at least until they fix the server issues and that various other issues and bugs that render the game unplayable

#####

this is a lazy attempt at a cash grab from the poorly implemented ai unscaling to the barely functioning multiplayer dont waste your money on this every match i join has every player on one team which results in a maybe five minute match you either steamroll or get destroyed games will show 5064 then will say that the game is full they launched with only three servers and all of them are janky they couldnt even get the audio right for the loading screen on the first game better of just turning my original xbox and getting a better experience that way its sad when you screw up a game thats been out for decades now i hope that this ruins aspyr or at least no one lets them put their hand on another game

#####

3440x1440 does run but models are still buggy af
servers are laggy 140 ping unplayable
refunded not worth 35

#####

my dog could have made it better

#####

multiplayer no work

#####

the lack of common sense when it comes to developing and maintaining star wars games seems like theyre intentionally trying to ruin the franchise

#####

refund

roger roger

how tf do you ruin a 20 year old game im so tired of everything being a disappointment literally everything music people society government movies and games i miss when games were completed on a disc and you put it in the console and play right away without 50gb installs and dlc i have zero anticipation for upcoming games now and i used to mark down days on a calendar as a kid for game releases like halo 3 what a shame that everything has to be depressing nowadays

 note  everyone should purchase the original swb1 and swbf2 on steam and play the many servers on there the og games run great on steam and still fun to play even online pvp please go play the original classics

#####

how do you drop the ball on a game that was already completed 20 years ago

#####

not only a terrible and nonfunctional remastering effort but they stole content from modders and added it in without crediting them or acknowledging them and then lied about it reprehensible dishonest trash

#####

httpsstoresteampoweredcomapp6060star_wars_battlefront_ii_classic_2005 just get this and get a mod to make it better looking

#####

this is a surprising one to say the least here we have what is more or less a remaster of 18 and 19 year old games with seemingly less stable netcode more bugs and an uncanny tendency to freeze and crash crazier still is that this game is significantly larger than the originals sitting at 628 gb unpacked while looking barely different from the og versions

it does not take long to see new bugs such as the camera going haywire upon death you will struggle connecting to even the most basic of community servers compatibility issues aside just get the original version for now if youre planning to relive the nostalgia if you absolutely must get this version for whatever reason wait for a significant sale or the game to be fixed

this is a combined rerelease of star wars battlefront 1 and 2 i played swbf2 for just short of two hours because im undecided yet if i intend to keep the game or try to refund it

its not all bad thanks to my massive nostalgia for the original swbf2 i did actually manage to have some fun playing this it has better controller support than the original even if there is a mod to add controller support to the original swbf2 the ui has plenty of issues including crashes in menus but it does at least scale to modern resolutions better than the original even if there is a mod to change ui scaling in the original swbf2 the thing that this release does most right though is that there are actually some other people playing it it was really something to experience actually populated swbf2 servers again even if the disaster of a launch and small number of official servers means the total number of active online players across all servers at least in my region and on a friday evening the day after release still never seemed to exceed about 150

a lot of it really is bad theres the crashes if you even look wrong at the menus theres the incomprehensibly large install size theres the weirdly low maximum controller sensitivity as of writing there seems to have been no dedicated server software release making it impractical to host community servers the most unforgivable problem to me is the lag spikes and very poor hit detection in online play the original had its share of jank but the rereleases issues are far beyond that you can line up a shotgun blast right into someones face and its like a coin flip whether you actually do any damage or not

id really like to see this cleaned up and made more playable but screwing the release this badly means that even if it is this rerelease will surely never see the same level of online activity as the originals enjoyed in their heyday it makes me deeply sad that there was seemingly a chance of experiencing that lively community again at least for a little while but it was ruined by the confounding decision to release this in such a broken and unfinished state
