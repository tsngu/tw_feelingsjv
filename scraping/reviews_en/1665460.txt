b10 reviewb
whilst efootball updated after such a long time the game is far from being in a fully stable place
allthough that is the case the fantasy team gamemode has started in its most very basic fashion and all the controls and mechanics have been improved to now all be playable

h1 good things h1
 improved all the basic elements and they work now its a real 01 version early access beta not a 10 tbh lol 
 freedom of the stunning modifier making you able to do wind up shotspasses on your own terms
 manual player selection option menu from ball or from player
 big serotonine shot during the dreamteam animation when packing a player looks well designed
 graphics up close face styles improved and are the only times stuff looks nextgen
 little details like legends having their year on the type ofcourse for more content exploration or exploitation  
 nice new league licenes like the jleague and north america or fake leagues with real life players

h2 bad things h2
 still unoptimised
 colour coded menu is still blinding
 ui in general is so simple it only seems like the technical side of it works
 crazy amount of ice skating on the players to make the animations work and link up to the ball
 feels extremely on rails because of the point above not in terms of controller to ingame actions freedom but in terms of game offering freedom
 even though its on rails player awareness can decline greatly it feels very predetermined when a player knows where the ball is
 more to the arcade side personal preference it does not simulate the depths of football in terms of ball physics foot planting momentum or power everything is simpler
 can do everything in stunning variant which is good and bad looking at realism only finesse shots cant be
done in stunning style because that becomes a canceled shot lol
 breaks all type of logic and momentum and physics override for more video gamey player freedom
 abysmally basic dream team menus
 dream team ultra basic seems like they just want to start up the coin buying machine
 freedom of choosing what to train on your dream team players it can be a good thing but at the moment i feel like
it undermines the hunt for amazing players and inviduality 
 no 3d grass during freekicks
 net physics feel like they perform at a way lower fps they are also not detailed
 scoring goals feel very lifeless to me because of this point above but also because theres just no weight to it no excellent ball physics
 lack of obviously a lot of modes still not even the basic ones are in there coop or offline play and all that

h3  pc only bad things  h3
 controller pickup extremely weird doesnt pick up my dualshock 4 in settingsexe anymore steam override works but has some added
delay
 60fps cap
 making it also have no vsync solutions
 no fullscreen resolution selection either

h4 still not sure about  h4
 the proficiency or player skill training styles choice you have to make forever on a certain player
 durability of this multi year dream team fantasy game mode


boriginal reviewb
____________________________________________________________
i cant recommend it at this state 
pes turns into efootball and joins the style of a live service game where updates can happen more frequently over seasons  years

a quick pros and con list after 4 hours of play

b pros b
 the idea of the new dribbling
 the concept of the new defending mechanics
 instant play from ball boys without cutting away
 some quality of life changes like condition arrow stat updates shown in game plan
 some immersive clean extra pre match cutscenes
 manual shielding

b negatives b
 menus and ui  colours
 manual shielding its a con and a pro because its implemented wonky once again
 graphics  lightning 3d grass crowd detail everything fucked
 animations  sliding of animations
 removal of a mega chunk of player id all players walk the same and shoot the same except on fks  pens
 removal of player momentum simulations
 removal of foot planting on animations
 players forgetting where the ball is or running in a bended way around the ball
 responsiveness of controls at times where the player has the ball 1mm infront of him but just takes a lot of time to respond or it just glides off and away
 the physicality being the most glitchy thing on the new l2 physical bodying move
 dumbed down tactics extremely basic options
 r1 to fake an action like a shot hold r1 for finesse but shoot  r1 after is faking it so you cant time when to transition into a finesse anymore which gives a lot less options shooting wise
 ball physics shooting trajectories feel dull extremely low wow feel when scoring ball physics also feel extremely dumbed down
 there is a weird balance between the x pass power and triangle pass power where the triangle passes power is so high power that you actually almost always overhit it unless certain angles 
 face emotions are different then pes2021 but not necesarilly better
 lots of random glitches occur at this moment in time
 doesnt feel premium in any way feels very cheap and mobile
 sound effects in menus sound as if theyre from the early 2000s searching for a game sounds like a nuke incoming  constantly and finding a match sounds like your dinner is ready
the l2 physical defending is also way too overpowered you can physically overpower quite a lot of folks even when they shield the ball because said physics go wonky


 pc only 60fps cap is vile 30fps replay cap viler especially as this seems to be an easy to run game 144hz squad where you at
 pc only no vsync options  fullscreenresolution picker

might improve over the weeksmonthsyears even as they can keep tweaking this but at this point in time and probably a long while its a not recommended for me


#####

at least the uninstall button works

#####

put pes 2013 back on steam and make it free

#####

end of an era huh ive been with pes since we got the original for christmas on ps2 ive been with pes no matter the licenses and wonky player names ive been through the decline and the new coming ive seen ea lose its ambition while pes still tried to make the game better and i genuinely thought that we surpassed ea already until

during all these years i mainly played master league ive patiently waited konami to deliver to fix the annoying things in the game the ai animations repetition etc pes 2018 has been tasting just a little old and i was looking forward to upgrading until

in the end pes was different than fifa and thats why we chose it over licenses arcade flash and addiction fifas novelties were street football and similar half finished arcade articles in pes we could usually wait a better game than before pes had history until

until until this this straight up downgrade clunky ugly unimpressive an insult konami gave ea the title for free and launched a cheap ftp title to flirt with the player base that wants to play a football game but not necessarily pay for it and it shows games not polished is a lie its not finished is stretching it middle of a wilderness road in pitch black darkness there youll find efootball 2022 youve all seen the pictures no words no excuses the gameplay the most important part feels heavy and tired some of the new controls are pointless some just straight up quality of life downgrades goals feel hollow 2 difficulties available no game modes game play feels worse than in an decade theres no soul i guess they thought that wed stick along silent and loyal

and until this review has become more a rant than anything i guess this is my goodbye letter theres no more football games for me maybe someday but i dont believe it or hope for it no longer is this how you become an adult



ps fifa never say never but itll be a cold day in hell

#####

pes 2013  efootball 2022

#####

words cant describe how great this game is but numbers can 110

#####

2 years people waited for two full years under the promise that this game was going to be groundbreaking
the only logical and possible explanation for how bad this game is is that konami wants to declare bunkruptcy or something
its equally laughable and sad
they launched a full game that lacks content left and right they even dumbed down the game plan settings
terrible just terrible
konami just enjoys shooting themselves in the foot

#####

damn efootball and eafc24 really go all the way down to the garbage i miss the old pes and fifa

#####

i want to refund my electricity

#####

played the game for 15 minutes and it made me want to commit numerous war crimes

#####

i likee the improved gameplay but there is nothing to do with the gameplay if you dont want to play online this game really needs master league and became a legend modes back until then i cant recommend a game where there is nothing to do except online modes

#####

this is a joke
the worst football game i ever played
it simply is a mobile game
the ball weighs 100kg the contacts between players are chaotic nothing feels right
its a shame

#####

as a pes critics defender throughout the years there are simply no words that can describe my disappointment 
sure they did have some unsuccessful titles and the majority of football games fans switched to fifafut but even still i did not give up on this game it was my childhood for christ sake my loyal dog who the hell would abandon his dog 
and seeing what this game become now im truly ashamed 

now that that the emotional part is out the way ill give you a bigger picture on what this game really is  
its nothing like the old pes 
you open the game first thing that pops up are all these ads new online headache crap all these random events like these top eleven style games you download to your mobile and believe me there are tons of them in efootball 
and for the offline modes forget it theyre gone for good rip i dont even know if patches are a thing anymore 

the gameplay  visuals are pretty decent the physics textures whatever not as good as they were on pes 21 but i cant deny they did a good job on the game engine sure it has potential so much could have been done to make efootball pes rise to its past glory  street football enhanced master league with press conferences shouts to players on the pitch relationships on the personal level with the team better be a legend with similar improvements but no they had to fuck it all up
the game somewhat feels like a cheap knockoff of fifa when will you understand konami morons that the online aspect of the game was never part of the success 

of course the review will probably be buried with all the dignity pes once had but its probably safe to say for pes  fifa fans that the era of good football games is over damn i need to get off the pc already

#####

i dont care that this game is free i still feel ripped off i demand a full refund

#####

no single player mode
no carreer
no nothing
not me im still out 
this game is as bad as konami is

#####

fck efootball fck konami congratulations you guys are perfect example how money and pathetic people can destroy awesome game pes was my childhood and the best football game ever and you killed it year after year is just worse i hope konami will bankrupt and nobody will rage in this game ever again like i do fck you

#####

the kind of game you get for free and still want a refund

#####

we need master league backk

#####

this game is a competition to see who has the most mental deficiencies the players clearly have some type of serious motor dysfunction maybe some sort of intelligence deficiency as well each different player has a different mental disorder or motor issue and the referee probably has paranoia or anxiety because he calls a foul for every slight physical contact between two opposing players the ball seems to be made of steel and most players seems to have ptsd related to it because they avoid it and seemingly have a panic attack whenever the ball gets close to them the commentators seem to be completely unaware that theres a football match going on and the crowd seems to be in a constant state of delirium given that theyll cheer at random times for seemingly no reason at all

this game runs awful plays awful and crashes whenever it feels like crashing it is hard to make a game thats worse than catching a std but here you have it this is just a simulation of football if it was played by people with parkinsons disease and its not funny its depressing the existence of this game is one of the most tragic events of this century

#####

dear konami
you have great name i respect and enjoyed for long in gaming
i have played your soccer game for decades on many platforms
since the title was winning eleven then you changed it to pes and now this efootball
i have been loyal and defended your title until today
do you realize that your game programmers and lead designers for this game has been cheating you
they have been eating huge salary without actually working for you making good coding
they only copy paste old program code and change the game skin
the game control still terrible even after multiple recent updates
sure i played very well and often won the game too and tried all functionalities auto or manual
but enough is enough after 248 hours playing thanks to you now i feel i have been wasting my time being loyal to this crappy and sorrow game
you should not be allowed to release a game like this
you take away genuine fun playing soccer game like winning eleven you originally launched
it would take years for you to get redeemed of all badkarma and curses by many disappointed players 
i will be uninstalling and never install this again until you bring back all the fun playing
good luck to other players i suggest you uninstall as well and enjoy your time with other quality games

#####

all i want is master league

#####

my grandma could do better
shes dead

#####

rubbish they destroyed pes all my childhood i played pes not fifa and i played every version since pes 3 to pes 21
it is like a demo game no master league no clubs we waited for 2 years for this tragedy i reccomend fifa it is not perfect but is still better than this s hit i am very dissapointed i expected more now i know why it is free because no one with a brain would buy it

#####

this is so bad that even free is too expensive

#####

the best ad for fifa 
it is a mobile game upscaled for pcconsoles but at least the uninstall button works
rest in peace

#####

wheres the fcking career mode  plis i need it konami

#####

people say that this game is buggy but the unistall button works just fine

ps id rather buy winrar

#####

this is probably the only game my wife manages to beat me to game sucks i hate it but my wifes smile and joy when she scores a goal beats all the cons this game has

#####

you promise me heaven then put me through hell

 its free

 konami destroyed everything good from previous game
after waiting for 2 years
1 gameplay feels so slow stupid ai and very poor control if you press run youll hardly control the player
2 very bad ui with blue and yellow colors and that pink background for club badge doesnt look good
3 buggy 
4 low fps during cut scene and replay
5 very simple tactic and also you cant choose formation the only thing you can do to change formation is dragging player position
6 lack of content at current state no master league no myclub no become a legend
7 look at that crowd bad graphic and atmosphere

#####

i am going to give a in depth review and my opinion of this game 

positives

1 great gameplay more realistic aproach than fifa i am fifa player my self and i can admit it 

2 i think this game despite the reviews has a huge potential only if they listen to the community and deliver what we all want and need in order to make this game actually have content which this game hugely lacks 
 thats about it to be fair i can only mostly praise the gameplay 

negatives there will be a lot

1 0 content 
2 no career mode which makes 0 sense while the game has barely anything to do besides playing dream team konami wtf
3 edit file is a must since there is not a lot of licenses
4 they seemed to focus on making this game mobile game which is what nobody wants
5 needs more regular updates
6 konami listen to your community and add master league and edit mode as soon as possible dont make people wait years for this or everyone is gonna quit and play fifa 23 

il conclude the review by negative still so konami actually listens and does what we all want them to do 


#####

efootball sucksreturn master leagueeeeeeee

#####

how to ruin your franchise 101

#####

this game is not worth the money and its free that should say it all

#####

bring back pes efootball is trash

#####

i prefer to play fifa 22 come on konami dont let me play fifa anymore  

#####

the v10 gameplay is good minor bugs here and there but no big deal 

but as a offline player there is nothing much for me to do i enjoy the gameplay for sure but lack of content is the biggest issue for me im still waiting for the master league and edit mode konami i dont mind to pay for ml and edit mode just please make them well thanks

this v10 update definitely has potential but because of there is not much content for offline player like me i couldnt recommend this game to the others


#####

bring back and improve the single playerfocused gameplay master league bal thats actually what we need

#####

is this the new game mechanics that you cant overdo it with it can work even better on mobile devices your new graphics engine freezes unnecessarily which is a shame if ea had taken over the company sat down and thought about how we could make this game the worst in 2022 they couldnt have done worse than that

#####

this game has become more of a cause of frustration day by day scripting all around and you feel it more with each update examples
 1st minutes after kick off or after a goal will almost certainly end up with a goal i score and concede too this way no need to do sth special just pass the ball and shoot
 last minutes of first and 2nd half will almost certainly end up with a goal again sometimes i score and sometimes i concede generally losing side will score disgusting to feel that you scored thx to game assist more disgusting if you concede
 if you are playing possession game and are able to hold the possession more than 65 percent and if you already scored a goal or two towards the end of the first half or after the minute 67 or so you will start realizing your players start acting stupidly they cannot hold ball cannot give or receive simple passes passes turn to be very slow powerless and inaccurate your players start turning right or left a lot slower than they did before even if they have the best condition rating what happens at this point is that your players start playing as if they all have bad condition condition arrow pointing down even if they have the opposite this is such obvious that you start to clearly feel that your players are no longer responsive and that you will concede a goal if you bear without conceding a goal one of your players will cause a penalty for the slightest of keypresses to steal the ball which would normally just steal the ball besides the word responsiveness of players and added input lag i can describe this as controller starting to feel heavy
 another point is about the league you keep winning until reaching 2nd division and suddenly something starts to happen and you can no longer win matches and all those above start happening more and more

there are a lot more to say and a lot more examples to give scripting is just a killer you do not play this game the game dynamically changes the side during a match which imo effects the result by 4050 percent 

as a person who has only played pes we or efootball football games since 2006 and who have also played efootball 2023 alone for 280 hours i would not give a negative rating but nope today is the day i do not take this torture anymore it just got worse and worse year by year day by day a hungry company being disgusting for the sake of making more money by  controlling the game you are supposed to be at full control of

#####

put pes 202120192018 for free with new players update maybe we can forgive you konami 

#####

at least the uninstall button works

#####

i will come back when they add master league so probably never

#####

this is the best horror game

#####

bring back pes

#####

this game is full of scripts that are meticulously designed to make sure that you lose certain games i dont know when it usually triggers but whenever it triggers the following things happen

1 when the game wants you to lose the game the defenders turn into sluggish brainless players that are harder to turn than turning a cargo truck 
2 the attackers intentionally place themselves behind opposition defenders in such a way that no pass can be made towards them it is bound to be intercepted by your opponent players 
3 the game also very subtly slows down your players in a game it wants you to lose so that you can never keep up with the opposition attacker
4 when the game doesnt want you to win a ball or catch up with a player it will deliberately make your take an unnecessary wider turn so that it takes just long enough that you cant reach the ball before the opponent 
5 attacking ai also becomes stupid high rated players like messi or mbappe cant receive a simple pass and just completely overlook the ball that just went past them and was meant towards them 
6 the keepers strategically place themselves in such a way that as long as a good enough shot comes towards their direction they will not be able to save it no matter what 

all of it feels terrible and out of control if you have played this game long enough it will become quite evident when the script is in your favor and when it isnt in your favor i know when my opponent is in the receiving end of the bad script my players zoom past them and make incredible passes that they cant stop but it doesnt feel rewarding because deep down i know that the game is handicapping my opponent so that i can win 

the game has incredible potential to be one of the best football games ever they have also refined the mechanics when the game feels fun but my gripe is that it feels unjustified when the game holds you back intentionally to make sure that you lose the game you end up playing against 2 entities your opponent and the game itself 

i wish someone would sue this game and end this trend of using scripts in a video game for player retention it is destructive selfish and malicious to say the least boycott this game and raise voice against big corporations that exploit players for their own benefit

#####

wtf lol after reading the reviews i thought i should try and its as bad as people make it out to be

their defenders jog faster than usain bolt my players play like they have cerebal palsy

#####

worst football game ever konami go home you are drunk

#####

i hate you konami and i hope this is your last football game you ever made

i played pes since pes 5 and it was beautiful football simulator all the time i spent 10000 hours in your games and were laughing to causal fifa guys how they are playing stupid arcade and not real football

but this game this is absolute garbage and trash 

stupid ai idiotic scripts wannabe realistic simulator controls which are failing all the time and overall fecking grinding piece of shiet i am too mad to pinpoint everything but lack of community and only few thousands of active players are speaking for me

i am going back to older game with 2022 mods funny isnt it modders can actually do much better work in their free time than you especially with gameplay  shame on you all

at least you changed name of this crap and you dont embarrass my lovely pes anymore

#####

this game is so bad i started enjoying valorant

#####

when i launched the game a mobile ad came up and i couldnt just close it but then my friend let me know that it was the actual game so i closed the game

#####

where the fuck do i even start with this shit

i have been playing pes for over a decade and would consider myself the core demographic i have forgone licenses marketing and basic features as i have always believed konami make the best playing football game 

saw that v 20 was being released today and as the cinch is officially licensed thought id give it a wee try my team  hibs  are in the game i can choose them as my dream team yet i cant play  even an offline  a game with the real players i cant even play an offline game as 2 real scottish teams even though they are officially licensed

what the actual fuck konami no1 in the community wanted this shit we just wanted a normal pes we would been happy with your fucking 2001 menus and horrendous commentary yet you give us this insane attempt at a cash grab where we cant even play as our fav teams 

take a long hard fuck to yourself and just patch this abysmal project and just make a regular edition of fucking pes 

0 outa 10

#####

doesnt matter if the game is free i still demand a refund

#####

i download the game just to say







#####

only good thing about this game is that it doesnt have pes in its title so we can probably overlook it tarnishing the seriess legacy

#####

i dont know why they bothered to hype up and even skip on pes2021 for this so called new engine game feels like the same old sluggish nonsense it felt before in other words there are no worthwhile football games worthwhile anymore

also who chose the ridiculous eyesore background colour and design some people need to be fired

steam should update its policy so that we can refund free to play games

#####

played v10 much improved over previous build a lot more stable and improved graphics such as the crowd and character model no problem running at 60fps at 1080p w gtx 1660ti mobile

on the pitch the animation and ball physics are pretty smooth 

however this is still no next generation game we were promised there is no wow factor

hate  the yellow blue color scheme makes it feel cheap

#####

just bring back the old pes concept

#####

i have been a huge pro evolution soccer fan since pes 5 i stayed faithful during all these years where konami was struggling with the license and was thrilled to play pes 2020 the game was not perfect but really going in the right direction
i was kinda happy when konami announced they needed more time to dev pes 2022 i thought they were really going to step up and release something interesting
omg was i wrong  efootball is a digrace in all the aspects of a video game i really tried to enjoy it but theres nothing to enjoy
i hate that i have to play fifa now but they left me no choice
rest in peace pes you will always be a wonderful memory 

#####

i am a passionate football player and love football aplayed well over 300h i am desperate for a great simulation which konami provided year after year since efootball it is not anymore you feel it used to be a pcconsole game but they are constantly simplify and degenerate gameplay in favor of mobile ported game

1 gameplay is what i call systemic and therefore exploitable go with neymar in the box by entering it in 45degree towards the goal and aim for the second post
2 when playing on superstar or legend ai is not actually playing better football it is a simple increase of goalscoringefficiency and a dumbing down of own player responsivenes
3 the fact that players with manual gamplay settings play vs fully assistedits a joke
4 players stop for milisec randomly while chasing the ballso aiplayers are faster
5 players are not aware of surroundings sprinting out of bounds to chase the ball
6 players move on predetermined rails no chance to change directionrelated to point 5
7 well timed short distance lop passes are impossible
8 graphics are a shame 
9 obvious momentum in gameplay in favor of the trailing team
10 menu and ui is horrible the score is blocking view on the field when action is on the top corner

it is obvious that they dont put effort in developing gameplay for a football gamesimulation they focus on how to get money from teenagers with footballer cards which are in fact worthless for 365 days no long term statistics it just doesnt matter which player or card you have and after that they dissapear
so much more  to complain about


#####

this is the worst game i have ever played it feels like a student project

#####

my friend who i play cs 2 with said if i post a review on efootball 2024 and it gets 75 likes and 30 awards that he will buy me a rtx 3060 and 1 kilo of lemon  so im just gonna leave this here help a brotha

#####

please remove this game from steam

#####

ive only one question 
why
why did you decide to throw in the toilet years and years of hard and good work and to publish this ugly clone of a mobile game

ive managed to resist for only one match after that luckily short experience ive had to visit my psychologist for a therapy session its absolutely depressing and devastating seeing the same franchise that made my childhood football games making this garbage pile
character models are straight from the sims 3 animations seem to be taken from baldis basic players literally walking through other players while theyre celebrating
this game was first released in 2021 so i expected at least some polishing or some new content instead of only being able to play online matches which was a feature that already existed at the release so in the end nothing really changed
if you want to play with your favourite team you have to play with your dream team or you are obliged to play with the immense variety of teams which includes around 25 teams its so pathetic
i swear to god after not playing pes for like 3 years i could still remember that the voicelines from the commentators were exactly the same
why does a long time fan of the franchise have to play the game that one despised called fifa
if ea sports decided to release a game where you play football with a squared ball where you win if you concede more goals than your opponent they would still get a hit ton of money because there arent really any other options

i could go on for hours and i played this game barely for 20 minutes its more embarassing than loud farting in a church

h1tty turkish pro soccer online  eh1tball 1984

#####

they took all the negative gameplay elements of fifa the scripting of the most recent pes games and released an online mobile game with zero content compared to older games congratulations on killing the pes series

#####

the poster is messi but there is no messi

#####

konami broke their amazing franchise with 2022 version it is no longer the football game i looked forward to play every year it is mere shadow of its former self they got rid off all the game mode options and expecting us to play online only unacceptable  the king is dead and fifa is the new game for all the offline players it pains me to say since i used to  hate fifa but thank god for fifa thank to fifa we still have a decent football game for single players shame on you konami

#####

horrifyingly bad in its current state 

pros 
 its not fifa
 when the game works properly attacking can be a pleasure

cons
 everything is scripted you win or lose before the game even starts especially in online this deserves its own segment so here goes

if youre destined to win then your players perform as they should do they intercept balls close down opponents quickly respond to your commands are able to perform onetouch passes and generally move as you will them you can also get away with practically any shove or soft foul when destiny is on your side its a joy much like vs the ai 

however if youre supposed to lose it is sheer hell on earth your players now walk as if theyre wading through treacle a slight move in any direction will have them wandering off the pitch to catch the nearest bus the ball never heard of it mate if anything they actively avoid it the slightest touch on an opposition player will cause a foul even if you didnt use the strong challenge option whatsoever yes normal tackles are now penalized because fuck you your players turning circle is now that of a broken down tractor or harry maguire on a good day 

thats just the defending onetouch football literally impossible your players will take an extra touch which you will inevitably get tackled from even if you pressed the pass button several weeks in advance runs in behind lmao no ill literally run out of passing range behind an opposition defender so you cant normally pass to me but i wont continue my run so you can through ball that would be like i dunno reality actually its better if every single player positions himself just behind every opposition player so that you have no option but to long ball oh wait you long balled it lmao psyche your 195cm striker just lost his 15th header in a row to a 170cm roberto carlos git gud 

every corner is an impossibility and every strategy utterly redundant every free kick which are normally quite easy when youre supposed to win will now magically go wide or into the stratosphere every penalty cunted into the far reaches of space or handled by an obnoxious keeper as for team tactics again absolutely pointless if youre supposed to lose theyll be marvellous when youre supposed to win youre playing mourinho for the counter or klopp for the press perfect when the coin lands heads insane utterly infuriating and completely irrelevant when its tails you might as well be playing with big dave from your sunday league as manager or any manchester united coach of the past decade 

oh and one last thing on attacking if somehow you do manage to find yourself in a goalscoring situation then lol nope the opposition keeper will literally give you an onfield circumcision as you control the ball on your chest he also gains the pace of adama traore with a rocket strapped to his anus for no apparent reason throughout the whole game and will anticipate through balls from alternate dimensions using the eye of agamotto 

 no edit mode the biggest draw of most pes games
 no master league or really any other mode but online 
 but no real online content to speak of thats right you have no option but no option you can buy extra objectives which you can fulfil by doing the exact same content but now youre paying extra to do the same thing for little more reward 

ive played pes over fifa for years and years i still maintain that when youre allowed to play pes or efootball is a better game and yes it still is but the thing is this game doesnt want you to be able to play it wants you to pay it dangles the carrot of decent gameplay mechanics a smoother more natural system and a more organic system of recruitment then snatches them away the moment you dont cough up your jizya tax 

fuck this game and fuck fifa too neither company gives the slightest fuck about its playerbase incidentally one of the biggest in the world unless youre a retarded whale willing to fork out 100s in order to purchase your very own doublesided coin then ignore this shocking coinflip of a game until they fix it im an avid fan of this series and i cannot in good conscience recommend it at the moment 

even free it costs too much mostly of your sanity

#####

i want to die

#####

if this game would be published on a mobile platform it would be ranked below dream league soccer still

#####

my wife left me

#####

its terrible even for a free game

i cant explain what happened with pes
it seems konami lost source code and project files from every pro evolution soccer game theyve developed for 20 years so their management hired some cheap outsource mobile developer to create from scratch a new generation crossplatform football game and they failed it can be the only reason why this game is so bad in everything
it still has interesting physics great set of faces for players which i prefer over fifa nice pr materials with messi neymar bruno fernandes alexanderarnold but so sad to see that visuals animations and football mechanics degraded
this game looks and feels like a mobile football game and at the same time it needs 4 gbs of gpu vram nonsense

upd with update 20 devs finally added ability to play with friends and world cup 2022 event 
game already had saudi arabia players but in the event sa as many other asian national teams has fake players squad not real ones
inexplicable sloppiness in everything

please bring back pes

#####

honestly just overall disappointed been a fan of pes for well over a decade now and this game has been a let down where is the offline portion of the game am i missing something there are some of us who dont want to spend real money and verse online players i just want to play the game offline i understand this game is free but id happily pay for the rest of it like the pes weve all known to love that all being said the game looks and plays great just wish i could play master league

#####

its good for a free to play game but its actually a trap when the game wants you to lose it will it will either slow down your player switching dribbling shooting or make your passes go to the opponents i suggest play it only up to the point you reach div 1 only because the more you play in div 1 the worst it gets div 1 has a lot of p2w god teams if you dont spend a lot of money these teams normally have big advantages in every situations its boring and predictable the low spenders or f2p players are just being fed to them by the system it makes the p2w players feel good since they spend a lot of money for their teams just dont fall into the trap play the game until div 1 and then play event games only unless you want to spend a lot of money on players to gain an upper hand that way you will have more fun i will still recommend this game since its free but you have to play this game smartly or else end up spending a lot of money for some cards spending a little like 30 is okay since we support the developer but not to the point which will cost us over hundreds per year for this game

#####

if they ported pes 6 onto unreal id pay to play

edit 992022
wanted to try the new 2023 updatestill cant change my resolution to anything other then 1600x900 or 720p its 2022 im perplexed can someone make a new footy game plz lol

#####

add ronaldo and messi kiss scene

#####

this game is a joke and its not a funny joke

#####

i want my money back even though i got it for free

#####

literal garbage

they had the chance to utterly destroy fifa by creating a free to play game for football and yet they ruined it

#####

theres a game on my bug

#####

i heard all the bad reviews but decided to give it a try it is worse than i imagined
update it is better now but there is lots of room for improvement id recommend it because i dont like the competitor title and this one does the job and it is free need better game modes especially for single players

#####

this game will seem fine in the begining but the more you play you end up only getting stressed and frustrated  here is why taking about the new 10 version 
first there are many cheathers that abuse this bad game and make your game disconnect if they lose  so they never lose points there is a video about this on youtube it was never fixed look for efootball 22 no loss glitch these cheaters also make the game lag and other sort of things like that
continue on
messed up refs that give penalty kicks out of no where red cards and fauls that never happened actaully nothing happen on the pitch  at least nothing the camera can catch and you get a booking also refs never have any sens in their half timeend game whistle they just do it in some sort of really bad code  but never in the moment it make sens as in real football  passing sometimes will just go any where but the direction of the input  and it doesnt matter which one of the different pass setting you are using dumb ai movement and behavior such as players making bad runs or no runs at all gk is dumb as a shoe  you will go near him with a striker and he will not make any move forward not even charge or anything freezing like a lifeless dummy defenders just letting balls pass in front of their face and dont react in any way or players getting hit by the ball and wouldnt react like they were just a sack of potatos with no life in them

and to finish this review  the game is also hard pay2win if you are not going to spend money expect to be in disadvantage 99 of the time cus you will face top tier players while as f2p player you can never get even if you grind 247 to get one of the big superstars will take you month if not months of grinding

fml i just wanted to play a good football game thanks for reading my rantreview i stand behind anything i said here  you might not notice this your first game but sooner than later you will 

#####

konami wtf are you doing ffs  you ruined the game with version 11  i dont play this shit
i cant intercept easiest balls  manual goal keeping not working  cant dribble in close range  we want pes 2021 back

#####

i never seen something so crippled

#####

i have no idea what i just played but i managed to clap irfo96 40

#####

marrying my cousin was a better idea than playing this game

#####

one word horrible it is a mobile game upscaled for pcconsoles

#####

only play this game if you cant afford fifa or dont want to give ea any more of your money  the only good thing about this game is that its freetoplay

if you want your eyeballs to be fried by god awful graphics  animations and then put to sleep by bland onetouch pass gameplay with ai taken straight out of the year 2010 whilst beating on whales with your dogger btech team then this is the game for you

#####

just bruh





 btw

#####

my father smoked his whole life i was about 10 years old when my mother said to him if you ever want to see your children graduate you have to stop immediately tears welled up in his eyes when he realised exactly what was at stake he gave it up immediately three years later he died of lung cancer it was really sad and destroyed me my mother said to me dont ever smoke please dont put your family through what your father put us through i agreed at 28 i have never touched a cigarette i must say i feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it because your game gave me cancer anyway

#####

it need a career mode


#####

years later and the improvements are 
 daily game that is actually a penalty one penalty kick what why

 master league imitation thats just the domestic league no buying players you get points that you can loan like 5 random players with

this game is managed so horribly it makes ea look good

#####

better play pes 2021

#####

efootball 2023 is an absolute travesty of a game that falls far short of the standards set by its predecessors from the abysmal animations to the unbalanced gameplay this socalled upgrade is nothing more than a glorified mobile game masquerading as a pc title its a true disgrace that konami has unleashed this steaming pile of garbage upon unsuspecting gamers

lets start with the animations or should i say lack thereof efootball 2023 seems to have gone back in time offering the player a collection of stiff robotic movements reminiscent of the early days of gaming players run like mindless automatons performing the same robotic motions over and over again its an insult to anyone who appreciates fluid and realistic gameplay

speaking of gameplay its painfully evident that efootball 2023 is heavily scripted every match feels like a predetermined series of events leaving players with a sense of helplessness and frustration gone are the days of strategic decisionmaking and improvisation on the field instead youll find yourself following a rigid path dictated by the games invisible hand

the lack of balance in efootball 2023 is staggering its as if konami threw any semblance of fair competition out the window certain teams and players are ridiculously overpowered while others are rendered utterly useless its a slap in the face to those who have spent countless hours mastering the intricacies of the sport only to be undermined by arbitrary and unfair mechanics once an attacker gets the ball the defenders normal speed increases and its very noticeable 

and lets not forget the fact that efootball 2023 feels more like a cheap cash grab designed for mobile platforms rather than a fullyfledged pc game the graphics are underwhelming the controls are clunky and the overall experience is lackluster konami should be ashamed of themselves for treating their loyal fanbase with such disdain

so yeah dont download even if its free

#####

its a mobile game

#####

i downloaded 40 gig to then find out this game uses denuvo anticheat  no thank you    i know about denuvo anticheat from other games and how hard it is to get off your system after 
why is there no mention of this on the store page   at least mention it uses this notoriousseriously google it anticheat malware before the download starts ffs

#####

reality is often disappointing

#####

please give master league again

#####

bring back offline mode soon and it will be the best football game ever made by far gameplay  graphics are great

#####

hitty servers 
hitty packs 
hitty gameplay 


what a waste of time 
i miss the old version of pes 

#####

why

#####

i will leave my honest and humble opinion as one of the true fans of pes 

i have been playing pes and iss pro football games for years  
fanatically following it  participating in tournaments and leagues  back when they were local arranged by internet cafes and videoclubs  

even though sometimes konami did us wrong  releasing a bad game  not having licences we were there  
buying the game  modding it  making it playable all around the world  

but this this is something that leaves an empty space in football games  fifa or fc or however the f#ck its called now  doesnt even touch the feeling  

this abortion that you dare to call efootball  take it  put a nice wrap on it  and shove it up your japanese asses  

fuck you 

#####

its better to play pes 2012 with 2022 patch

#####

i feel i have done something wrong and god punishes me every time i play a match

#####

if i had a gun with two bullets and i was in a room with flatout 3 nba2k18 and efootball 2022 i would shoot efootball 2022 twice

#####

uninstalled after 2 games they mustve felt that pes mobile is a success so they created a pc consoles version game is no longer fluid ai is slow in reacting character models have what seems to be dynamic movement making them unrealistic the slow and consistent character models from old games is what kept the gameplay fluid and better than fifa this gameplay is in the middle of both games pes ball physics and fifa player character models which is atrocious you cannot mix the two because they have completely different styles 2 years waiting for a game with no myclub no ml or bal and on top of that graphics in 2021 look worse than pes 13 and 17 i dont know how this was released

#####

game difficulty levels are atrocius

at midlevel your players have possession all the time 4 people make runs on the line in the attack so youve got plenty of options for a pass and every single player is the best tackler in the world actions are near instant
easily score 5 goals even though i havent played any football game in over 15 years

you go up a couple notches in difficulty near to the top and suddenly the physics are different and your players are complete idiots they cant pass or shoot unless you press it 3 seconds before the ball arrives at your feet any other button then a simple x will give the ball away the opposition players are omnipresent always pressing intercepting 50 of your passes easily dispossessing you with a tackle every time you get the ball on your feet and while you had 4 people making runs on the line at an easier setting now youve got no one so youre just looking for your idiot players to get to some space so you can pass

but they dont so you lose possession again

there has to be a way to make the higher difficulties more challenging without completely altering how player physics work and completely dumbing down the players

the way it is right now is just too damn frustrating

ps also and this is neither here nor there but how do they have nearly the exact same player animations from 2006 how is it still so clunky

#####

at least the uninstall button works

#####

i still play pes 2021  and uninstall efootball 2023 worst game ever

#####


















#####

pes2022 is a psychological horror game produced by konami studios it carefully blurs the line between gaming and politics with concerns it was created to demoralise the west
if you love those moments where you have your head in your hands and you consider breaking the keyboard or throwing the controller out the window youll love this 

watch as the game algorithm makes minor calculations and unpredictability based on concepts like team spirit and form

watch in vain as 4 men stand around watching a ball because the computer has decided they are not due to receive it

battle against the referees who will allow your forwards to be dragged back knocked over and brought down while clear on goal but will book your players for a millimetre of gentle connection with the opposition while winning the ball

#####

fifa mobile is way better than this

#####

absolute disgrace 2 years of development yet it cant even come close to their own previous releases from 10 years ago  wtf konami such a pity

#####

i will leave this cat here friends who pass by can pet it and give it a thumbs up

#####

this is not the worst pes ever this is the worst football game ever

#####

defending does not exist

having read a lot of negative reviews i really wanted to experience this open minded however immediately it is clear that the reviews do not lie

#####

simply uninstall this and go back and play pes 2021 with a 2023 option file it is much better than fifa and its a joy to play instead of this crappy creation its one year of waiting and waiting and updates and and and  what is the result its simply a disaster konami devsbring our good old pes back

edit #1
update 22 starting to show some promise i think developers are trying to reach level of pes 2021 gameplay but also take it a step further still not so good but a few steps in the right direction

#####

i love the rpg aspect of this game
every pass feels like a dice roll

#####

ok i will leave a honest review on this first of all sorry for my bad english is not my primary leangue this game is worst then i originaly thoutgh first of all you will notice an extreme lag secound of all i have not found many elementary settings like changing the control combo presets they said that this is with a new engine and from the ground up it is litaraly worse then pes 2017 and fifa mhm lets say 2005 this is not the ultimate efootball experience by far now i want you to know that this is a day one review so a lot can change but the simple fact that u have 20 fps is absurd it is very blury and pixelated probabaly wont buy any dlc or career mode for this is litaraly unacceptable konami shoud sell they liciences and go make a flash game please just dont expect much from this if they dont fix the absolut lag and bad looking graphics i mean dude the pitch looks like its litaraly drawn on paint on windows 98 if they dont fix this game witch is pathetic pes is oficialy dead 
oh and the premium player pack is 40 euros you better keep your money this is just a total fail
oh 
update did i mention that during cut scenes u have 10 fps max 

#####

efootball makes professional football player looks so stupid and idiot by its gameplay
almost 2 years and still not any better than pes 2014
f off

#####

good for broke people like me who cant afford fifa 

#####

just bruh

#####

by far the worse pes ive ever played
is that a real pc version its seems like a mobile game emulated
the ball weight is probably 50kg
players movements are slower than before
the menu collors are just awful
dynamic camera is messed up
dribbling is still not as effective as it should be players should be able to execute commands fast not with a delay or inputlag

a short time ago pes was known for having amazing graphics and players models and now konami messed it all up the game looks awful in almost every aspect
was that really a game that took 2 years of development it seems like a beta or alpha version

at least people didnt had to pay for thisthing 
at least you tryed to improve the dribbling and defense system but stil has a long way to go pal

avoid this game until they fix it if that ever happen 
buy fifa instead








#####

my gambling addict friend said if i post a review and it gets 250 likes and 100 awards that he will buy me a case of beer some vodka and 1 kg of lemon so im just gonna leave this here

#####

this is actually the worst sports game i think i have ever played in my entire life the amount of control you have over your players is minuscule let me provide an example when press a button to pass my player will pass however i do not know when he will pass i do not know who he will pass to and i do not know at which speed he will pass that ball there is absolutely no reason that any player in this game should consistently miss the net from only 1015 feet out but they miss all the damn time fouls are inconsistent mechanics are deceptively awful and there is no reason to play this game when you can go to the local park and watch some mindless children kick the ball around because it is the same level of play as i am getting from mbappe and messi

#####

pes 2021  eputbol 2023 100

#####

the art of how to destroy a game

#####

never complaining about fifa again

#####

congrats to konami for killing the one good footie franchise this game is so bad way to fast unresponsive controls even if you play fuma i guess that this game is ok if you like energy drinks and button bashing games and dont give a fck what you are playing it is more then 2 years in developement a still as bad as 2 years ago turn back on the servers for pes 2021 konami

#####

they ruined this franchise efootball pes 2021 was so much better then this

#####

everytime konami do an update the game will be worst and worst and worsthow an earth a defender with speed lower than 70 can match with forward with speed and acceleration above 90 stupid konami

#####

teribble where is master league

#####

efootball is the worst football game ever im a pes veteran playing since iss deluxe 1997 winning eleven and pes konami just destroyed a good game pes 2021 and release this mobile crap ported to pcconsoles called efootball  this game is sluggish there is command delay with poor graphics and the worst gameplay ever its a downgrade

#####

there is nothing to do in this game without the master league

#####

pes 21 better than efootball

#####

congrats konamiyou have successfully killed off the pes series

efootball 2024 is a garbage game that fails to capture the realism  and charm that the pes series is known for  when konami announced that they would begin working on a new enginefans were filled with optimismhowever 4 years in they found out very quickly that pes and everything that fans loved about it is dead fan favorite modes like master league and bal are nowhere to be seen  

 like fifa and ea konami also decided that making money is far more important than making good games that is the only logical explanation because peseven without licenses was always a better game than anything ea ever put out

 instead of capitalizing on what made the series great they decided to be like the competition and  theyre absolutely failing at it   efootball 2024 is everything that  futbol fans hate about fifa but worsethey lack presentation and licenses to pull it off so not only will this not impress new playersbut theyre losing their core base as well

the game is simply not fun to play pes 2021 seasons was by far a better game than this and those idiots took it off steam to push this garbage its free to payyeah you read that right  free to pay garbage

player physics  trash

ball physics trash

presentation  trash

defending  trash

attacking  trash

licenses  never been their strongest point but they used to get a pass because it had redeeming qualities such as the    gameplay  bal ml and co op and plus the fans took care of that with mods and option files anyways trash

ui  againthey were never good at itbut somehow it got worse they also bombard you messages when you open the game  trash

fun factor  its not fun to play you score and it feels so unsatisfying you get the urge to quit the game on start up i dont think ive had a game do that to me in a long while  trash

its not change that killed pesit was konami and their greed

looks like were already forced to play fifa or quit soccer games at all
i feel sad for every second i spent downloading and trying the game

#####

unrealistic engine goodbye pes

#####

game is meh look at this instead











posted 14 august

#####

bought fifa after playing this for 23 minutes

#####

i played this on release on xbox and bought master league and other offline modes even the game was pure dog shit but i did it to support the series that i love but it got cancelled by the devs you just destroyed the name of pes with this stupid unnecessary changes its just sad how this masterpiece series became a total shit

#####

good gameplay bad microtransactions this is efootball 2024 for you who want master league become a legend and many more go away there wont be something like that ever again this game is free and didnt have a bunch of license its just konami being konami but hey the game is actually good if you didnt go for microtransactions epic player and had skill to play the game

gameplay
defending the forwards are not op at all if i must say they are easily to break if youre smart enough to play your defender by not double pressing if you love to doublepress with the defenders your game could end on a loss you need to defend your zone by defending your zone and the movement of your opponents you could easily get interception of misspass or easily take the ball away from opponent feet when they try to receive 1st touch

possesion i cant say much im a possesion based person so i would easily shortpass to every player that is close sometimes i would go for cross if certain player is free

attacking this is the worst part sometimes i hate it too everything is balance and balance is everything if your player trying to receive the pass while theres opponent behind them you could possibly lose the ball like 70 of time you gotta bodyfeint the opponent to get past or any skillfull things i never done that tho its a bit confusing for casual player like me

graphic
the graphics is good its not overrealistic but its fine theres no graphic error on my playtime so its good

online
the matchmaking is all fine too fast matchmaking and its balance for me i had no problem with the server

microtransactions
its bad really bad its hard to get that ecoin the gold one for f2p well thats what you get if you dont want to spend your money on the gacha

mode
it doesnt have much mode its free after all so no complain

enjoyment 810 casual player 610 competitive player
if youre casual player theres nothing to complain you didnt spend your money or spent a little play for like 1 or 2 hour a day maybe 5 hour a week
if youre a competitive player you will get bored easily for the lack of content and bad microtransactions about the gameplay i dont have much to say for the competitive player they could have their own opinion

overall 710
pretty solid game for fun sitback and relax and it could be challenging if you meet an opponent that on par with you

#####

the cluster of a release window aside the game has actually improved dramatically since then which isnt saying much compared to previous pes titles the gameplay is just a bit dull honestly feels boring to play and wholly unsatisfying the game massively favours defenders in that they can suddenly have a burst of speed and catch up to the attacking player every single time it doesnt matter how much space your attacker is in how far ahead of the defender they are their acceleration or speed stats none of that matters the defender will catch up close you down and win the ball back its a joke 

this is only further compounded by the through balls and passing in general being absolute dog  99 out of 100 through balls played through when your attacking player is making a dangerous run and is in plenty of space to receive the ball instead of carving open the defence and putting you through 1 on 1 to goal the pass just goes absolutely nowhere itll either be massively over hit and go out of play massively under hit and pathetically travel 2mph and turn over possession or the invincible defenders will just intercept or tackle your player as soon as they receive the ball they either need to nerf defenders slightly or buff through balls slightly it feels ridiculously unbalanced atm changing pass assist to level 3 helps but its still shockingly bad 

18 months after release still no master league or 2v2 coop pathetic 

ive recently started playing sp football life 2023 based on pes21 gameplay and it has opened my eyes to just how bad efootball truly is its night and day its fun and exciting and rewarding to play the exact opposite to this im done i quit i can no longer play if only to get away from the cancerous eyesore of a monstrosity they call a user interface how far konami have fallen with this series is quite remorseful i cant foresee them ever really turning it around and witnessing an unlikely redemption arc its dead rip

its free to play and you can easily build a good team fairly quickly without spending any money please please dont buy any gold coins or hand over any money konami doesnt deserve any reward for this awful game

#####

no pros no cons just 2 words  absolute garbage
as a 15 year pes fan and player it seems like its done for me

#####

please add sex

#####

game against bot are scripted like hell there is no way you going to enjoy the game the ball will just fall into the ais leg easily if they want to score definitely they can score no matter how strong your team is useless script

#####

better than antifootball fifa

#####

been playing konami football games since winning eleven 4 the only thing i have to say is thanks for taking out pes or we name out of this thing you call a game at least you didnt ruined that but hey maybe youll catch up some of the guys who thinks fifa price is too high guess im not playing football games this year
update april 22nd 2022 when you thought it couldnt be worse and end up surprised

#####

the worst pes ever bad menu bad new controller config bad game plan i hate you who make this idea

#####

its incredible how they degraded

#####

konami killed the pes franchise and replaced it with this heap of trash the gameplay is butchered to a point that a 10 year old version of the game pes feels much better than whatever the hell this is the online component is literally filled to the brim with cheaters the game itself is kinda pay to win having a team full of epics and legends makes a big difference so overall i wouldnt recommend it if you respect your time and want to play a soccer and sports game go play the old pes franchise

#####

a tremendous piece of sh1t pay to win they killed sports games with their horrible macropayments and no matter how much time you spend to improve and train your players always the golden premium card 90 legendary player will make the difference

#####

glorified mobile game aka the main objective is making money with minimal effort

#####

i cant afford fifa

#####

big improvements since launch finally seems to be a decent alternative to fifa like older pes games easier to build a good team than in fifa still missing master league but hopefully that will come soon

#####

fubol fubol mesi mesi


#####

if your bored you want to play fifa but you cant afford it play efootball


#####

if they worked on the game more i can see it being a good game

#####

horror absolute horror

this is a classic case of developers breaking whats working and putting in more crap that doesnt work
i do not know what game i will buy next i surely know what i wont buy this nightmare of a game

advice
1 do not bother to install this even for free
2 if unfortunately you did uninstall asap
3 nightmare ends

this game is not worth a minute even with it being free enuff said

now wheres my refund for 15mins of wasted time

#####

when playing online matches my team plays like brain deadsome times when i kick the ball forward the ball goes backward or leftright after the last big update the player who gets the ball or if the ball slips out the player will be standing at that position like he is in a shock

#####



#####

totally dissappointedstill playing pes 2021


#####

very good game if you cant afford fifa

#####

im not one to write negative reviews generally i usually try to focus on the positive aspects of every game which might be many or not really although rule of thumb every game does at least one thing right efootball 2022 is by all means a step backwards i do understand that an engine switch is usually a big challenge and more often than not the first iteration is a disaster pro evolution soccer 2014 was an example of that awful impossible to enjoy but it matured greatly over time and became my football franchise of choice is history repeating itself

with the advent of the new generation one of many from the everevolving game and hardware development scene the old and faithful fox engine wasnt good enough and had to be replaced by something much newer and apparently visually pleasing epics unreal engine it is completely possible to achieve great things with it but whatever konami came up with isnt anywhere near greatness if anything the final outcome is what you would expect from a mobile game of sorts clunky gameplay mechanics ai with short bursts of brilliance and long moments of complete vegetativeness awful user interface and user experience a tragedy from every angle

pes 2021 was almost there it was not specifically great and got outsold by fifa but with a couple gb of mods and patience it could deliver an acceptable experience efootball on the other hand brought the franchise back to the nightmarefueling late 2013 coincidently also a transitory period from console generations once again another gamble and yet another defeat

some of the problems need to be immediately addressed if they really want to stay relevant for starters the performance is awful my rtx 2070 struggles to keep up with high settings in full hd framerate is all over the place during cutscenes and the vsync is wonky locked at 30 fps during replays yet unlocked during the entrance scene all in all a very inconsistent experience the gameplay itself needs a lot of work too its awful and nothing like how it used to be it feels like an entirely new game and its not a good thing because its even more distant from what one would expect of something that tries to emulate real world football

maybe thats why they made it free to play its not something you would want to pay for 

ill be updating the review when it gets patched from now its a big no either buy fifa or stick with pes 2021

#####

made me destroy my pc screen
edit im not lying by the way

#####

the game is very good but i just want back the master league game mode and also become a legend

#####

this game genuinely gave me depression for the 30 minutes i played it

#####

very bad game it is better to play pes 2021 with mods rather than this one

#####

i played a few hours and it isnt that bad as people makes it out to be though this does feel like a halffinished product or a demo if u can call it i hope konami patches this game up and fixes it it isnt all that bad but the controls feel odd at times but the server quality seems better but why the f would you launch a game at max resolutions of 720p and 900p respectively the pitch looks so crap

#####

still a long waaaaay to go but the new 10 version is definitely a step forward in the right direction

#####

i usually do not write review but this game is just beyond bad

#####

what a shame instead of taking the opportunity of creating a better simulation game with a new engine they wasted two years creating a free to play disaster this is a broken unfinished mess of a game

#####

if youre on pc be prepared to cry

#####

all we need is a match lobby and the ability to play with friends for a football game however this developer is too busy at making flashy legendary player cards and selling coins to noobs instead of making actual improvement for the game after their socalled huge v10 update you would have a huge selections of 7 teams to play in offline mode

#####

i played it in release and its soo much better now its still missing team manage and so but overall for free its gerat reccomend you try it


#####

best horror game to play on halloween

happy halloween to everyone reading this btw

#####

they are wearing ankle weights for sure 

#####

i played the winning eleven  pes  series since 1998 this one is mos disappointing one

#####

you know fifa is not such a bad game after all

#####

what kind of garbage is this
how am i suppose to play offline with my friends if the team was only argentina vs barcelona
lolololol
how can konami keep up with this
310

#####

this is my honest review of the game

this is a demo disguised as a full game
it doesnt have any modes
the only thing you can play is a stupid online event or a 5 minute exhibition game
the new mechanics are wonky and feel stiff if you full sprint your player becomes uncontrollable the passes are slow and inaccurate defense feels terrible if a defender hits lb on you it transforms you into a ragdoll

if they unlock everything maybe it will playable for now just skip
for how terrible this release was they should release ml and bal for free

#####

my pp got smaller

#####

some things can be lost forever

efootball is a reminder than no matter how much of a constant we think things are people the places where we grew up everything can change in a flash

in this case its just a game i have lost just a game or is it 25 years of memories of friends i played it with of the pure joy and release it gave from everyday life of my wasted uni years

if you look at items available for this game it will tell you all you need to know a sea of gold coins poker chips the house is hoping to gobble up forget the game lets focus on transactions and profit  suit man a everyone else in the industry is why dont we suit man b yes good idea suit man a lets ditch all our former integrity and cash grab instead this generation of kids cant tell the difference anyway they dont know how great our games are  the subtlety and nuance we thought we still had with pes 2021  they just want endless packs to open  thats the future

the premise of this game is complete and utter acceptance of failure to make a proper football game that is fun and instead a descent into the seedy world of pachinko mobile lucky 7 sleaze the game is a wafty caramelslow piece of crud for mobile with no depth or personality  it offloads a steaming pile of brown on the series legacy and sounds a death knell for the world that once was

ps fifa is the same thing just a hell of a lot better 



#####

disaster unplayble

#####

this must be some kind of a joke id like to see the konami exec who saw it and said its fine lets go out with it its a downgrade from last years edition in pretty much every aspect its free to play but even free is too expensive here it feels like an early alpha preview not a finished product get your act together konami

#####

even free is still terible

#####

stop looking for positive reviews there is no reason for you to download

#####

edit comeback again give it a try and surprisingly its getting better the game content still lacks but gameplay getting solid each update
decent online campaign cheaters are less compared to before still lack contents but even tough the process is slow but the direction is correct solid gameplay and fun tactical games
ive played this game online for more than 1000 hours on multiple account

#####

im in top 10 players in this game

still i cant give it a positive review  it has no content that make you want to play more

untill this game has more content and better server i will change the review

#####

this will be the worst football game ever until konami does a worse one

#####

i will leave the cat here so that everybody who passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards

too scripted

#####

one of the worst games of football ever replays every 5 seconds make me sick cant even handle too many of those its like seeing ads every 5 seconds and im pretty confident ive used the skip button the most the opposing team is programmed to get a goal right after you get one like all the players intentionally slow down like wtf player switching is horrible controls are almost nonexistent players dont really stick to positions leaving large gaps everytime and the worst part i dont think ea is any better 2024 as a whole is horrible for football games

#####

this game exists

flatout 3 finally a worthy opponent our battle will be legendary

#####

this game is a gold bar in an ocean of shit the gameplay is theoretically typical konami and if you like pes you would like efootball
but this gameplay is drowned in an ocean of problems
add to that the disastrous servers and the hackers in the pc edition where you are winning and then suddenly the game is broken even though you were winning you lose and your opponent wins
the game is currently not at all enjoyable online on the pc and makes you nervous instead of happy
offline isnt a master league yet and the offline events are just stupid
crossplay is not available which means that a pc player can never play against playstation or xbox friends
i regret the money i spent on this game

#####

it is very clear that the main purpose of this game is to be a multiplayer football experience like fifa where youre given control of your own dream team at first glance it seems like a great idea for those who dont wish to waste money on garbage like fifa 23 but that said efootball is pathetic

the gameplay isnt the issue yes it feels slow and is a massive step down from pes 2021 but still this game is all right to play the problem is the multiplayer matchmaking is an absolute joke in the league there are 10 divisions the closer you are to division 1 the better you probably are as a player but at some point it becomes impossible to get promoted to the next division because 9 times out of 10 you will get matched up with a player from division 4 3 2 etc regardless of whether youre in division 7 8 or even 9 

the skill gap is huge and it becomes virtually impossible to win with each new game you hope that the matchmaking will give you someone in your own division to play against so that you can enjoy the game but this never happens you will always get put in a match with a division 4 sweat who not only is a better player but chances are has a much better team games against these players are miserable and half the time youd be happy to draw against them 

trying to run through with your 82 rated cf theyre defender will be faster trying to stop their cf from running past your line their cf will be too fast to catch

this game seemed overhated at first but after 9 hours it is clear that this game is a waste of space

#####

good game if you want to have mental breakdown 


#####

if there is no master league than there is no need to play this game

escripting 2023


#####

fifa is better and i was a pes fan

#####

scripted piece of shit if the opponent has to win then he will win your players like in space jam suddenly lose skills and you cant do anything about it the worst is the opponent ai crappy players suddenly play and move better than the stars why because the ai is supposed to win the match avoid this shit there is no point in wasting your nerves on this thing

#####

forget about all the missing features the game itself is just bad there is little to no skill involved to play top teams just pass the ball constantly and shoot at your goal players in defense with lower rating respond insanely slow to loose balls or wayward passes giving away extra oppertunities i was quite excited by the focus on gameplay first features later but the gameplay is just bad at this point find another way to create a skill gap between players than making one react fast and the other slow

#####

best game ever i play it with my friends all day longthe guy who is pointing me with a gun told me to mention the thing about my friends

#####

its getting more and more pay2win with the booster shit but it is still the only proper football game on the market with realistic player and ball physics not to mention that you can still achieve a lot with free players and konami is still generous for giving us lots of nominating contract players and weekly highlighted players i would suggest you take it easy and try to just enjoy the pure football fifa or ea fc has lots more content and license but it is not football anymore

#####

this game is full of cheaters lag awful retarded menus and the developers do nothing about it konami is deaf to the community and the gameplay is made out of stress and frustration we have paid money for the pes series year after year in spite of all the negative comments out of loyalty and hope and all we have received is this nerve destroying rigged simulacrum of a game shame on you konami invest in servers and think about the armies of supporters you have dissapointed ihope you all sleep well and peaceful

#####

this game is suprisingly shocking to the core of my bone and my body i press run and he run but cant stop
i try to shoot and pass and he didbut not good and body balance for every player is not fair how can my face is pull by a centre back with strength of a gorilla and down with a pain but no foul and i dont know you say goodbye please let me you didnt goforever my love
seriously why i cant enjoy the gamei dont why but the feel is not rightyes is true i tell you now you tell mewhats wrong with this world i dont but i smile in front of my family

#####

this is a mobile game i dont know why is it in steam in the first place

#####

at least now the game is called football not soccer



and that pretty much sums it up about the positives

#####

got a cat here friends passing by can touch her and click like to pet her once award for good luck take my points for infinite pets

#####

a crap game pes was what we wanted this game was based on master league without this mod its a cheap copy of a mobile game

#####

trash game


#####

a disabled fifa

#####

no


#####

garbage

#####

the halloween horror of pes 

#####

konami please go back to pes versions because this version of efootball was ridiculous

#####

one of the worst pes games ever right after pes 2019
bad ai bad gameplay mechanics no coop very confusing menu a lot of loadings and waiting time it feels like an amateur indie game pes 2020 and 2021 were the best

#####

resolution is just horrible i dont know why but 4k looks just as jaggy as 1080p i think the game only renders in 1080p or lower no matter what resolution you put on your monitor i tried fullscreen and windowed fullscreen all jaggy

i know its free but at least make a free game that we can play whats the point of making a free game that we cant play

#####

the pes veteran here that is playing since 2002

first and foremost do not let this many bad reviews fool you with recent updates game is starting to look decent and is providing satisfying football simulation experience in my opinion

note that it will probably be even more playable when full release is out there give it a try but do not give up after one or two match my hint to you is to have some patience learn new mechanics especially on defense and have fun

still i cant stand scripting and it kills all of the fun for me so negative review

#####

a huge step down from the last games in the series and no attempt to focus on game play and building on the new engine even after all the initial negative feedback they continue to go with the same game plan of barely change the game play and keep the same graphics but add cards upon cards with barely any reason other than addiction to gambling to use them because there are not enough game modes to use

konami should be ashamed of themselves to shun 25 years of loyal fans to be a free to play no effort required card game dont buy any coins on this game because thats what funds this mindset in development

#####

scripted game
bad servers
cheat and hack

#####

the entire premise of this game is bad 

why not at least make a decent singleplayer with ability to play cup matches or league matches with no restrictions on players
also some key players in some national teams are missing 

i dont know if that is an image rights issue or whatever but at least you could have given us option to play some singleplayer league or cup matches with adjustable difficulty

#####

better than paying 70

#####

this is an honor that efootball 2022 became the worst game in the history of steam
this makes it worthy of a positive review

#####

its decent the game looks like its for the people with low budget like me if you cant afford fifa and that stuff this is best for free that you can get the stadium ambience looks really good but for real they need to add more celebrations and next gen animations the pes used to be same good as fifa back in time but now its really far from fifa and yea if you want something to play i prefer efootball2023 i have not tested fifa 23 because i have no money for it but i am open if anyone can its not needed but i appreaciate 

but please konami please add more clubs to trial match and add uefa partnership and nike and adidas partnership and that stuff why yall lost that

thanks for reading this review

#####

while i was not impressed at all when the game launched i decided to change my review to positive as efootball improved significantly over the past 2 years a solid game of football regardless of its technical debt and bad design decisions matchmaking quality is the main issue right now

#####

pay to win

#####

insult to konami

still garbage

#####

this game is so bad dont play it ive played pes my entire life but this has nothing to do with pes deleting this game i cant do this anymore

#####

this is a very bad game
these are my impressions as a div1 player with about 100h on record
im a p2w rat not proud of it there is no other way with this game if you want legends rn
these are my thoughts on v11we will see how s2 is so here we go

pros its not fifa
constheyre trying to copy fifa but not the good parts
         f2p is a lie f2p players can only use standard players
         as a f2p it takes a loooong time to build a standard team to compete with p2w
         lack of game modes
         lack of revards
         the few game modes offer lackluster rewards
         players are retarded defenders get nutmegged atackers ignore balls keepers are
         referees are retarded red cards and pens everywhere
         hackers
         konami is run by idiots almost 1 month without content between season1 and 2 with that time gone from players contracts which is kind off a problem for people that bought players with their wallet
after 200h the game is still shit content is still lacking f2p can obtain special cards here and there they introduced new and better versions of cards that were bought with money prior to v20they just shit on the morrons that put money in the game me included which makes me think this is going to become a trend and most importantly gameplay is still garbage they boosted the defending ai so much it feels like pifa 
almost everyone parks the buss and counters on the wings and spamms crosses 0 skill 0 ball knowledge

#####

whens master league launched

#####

oops wrong game


 are you winning son

 
 

 
 
 
 

 






#####

worst pes game ever simple as that

#####

dreadful absolutely dreadful id rather eat my own shit and then shit it out and eat it again this is game should be classified as psychological horror please save your time and not download this

#####

efootball 2023

#####

only good thing about this are the memes

#####

its worse than playing a game from mid 00s graphics are alright but the gameplay is horrendous its like playing with sticks 0 movement 0 reaction speed not the great game that it used to be

#####

final review the game is very bad after giving it 3 chances this is my final verdict a completely paytowin game a disaster in the matchmaking limited to no end in its game modes being in division 9 just starting they match you with guys in division 1 with special cards that you wouldnt manage to get playing obviously you have to put money into the game if you want to have a more than decent team i do not recommend it even if they paid me for this infernal swill this game will simply die sucking fifas feet a disaster everywhere you look thanks konami for killing the pes saga i will never install this garbage again

#####

with the marketing strategy shifted towards free 2 play model and mobile games konami focused only on dream team  the poor man ultimate team from fifathe absence of other game modes is just sad

maybe one day we will get back the glory years 20012006 but not this yearim afraid the rivalry between fifa and pes is over let just hope they will bounce back 

however being a f2p game surely gained some hearths and fans

pros

dream team
f2p

cons

 not enough single player content

my review score

story         1 sorry dream team is not enough
gameplay 7  
graphics   7
sound       6 

overall      525

a disappointing dive into efootball 2024

as an avid gamer and a fan of football simulation games i couldnt help but feel let down by efootball 2024 konami had an opportunity to elevate the gaming experience with this release but unfortunately they missed the mark on multiple fronts

first and foremost the graphics are a significant letdown in an era where gaming visuals are reaching new heights efootball 2024 looks like it belongs to a bygone era the player models lack the realism and detail that are standard in modern sports simulations its as if the developers took a step back in time and not in a nostalgic charming way

the gameplay itself is where efootball 2024 truly stumbles the controls feel clunky and unresponsive making it frustrating to execute even basic moves the artificial intelligence of both teammates and opponents is laughably inconsistent teammates seem to have no awareness of the game situation often making baffling decisions that no professional footballer would ever make

the muchtouted online multiplayer experience is plagued by connectivity issues and lag making matches a chore rather than an enjoyable experience its disappointing that in an age where online gaming should be seamless efootball 2024 struggles to provide a stable and enjoyable online environment

the lack of licensing for major teams and leagues is another glaring issue while other football games have secured licensing deals that immerse players in the authentic world of football efootball 2024 falls short generic team names and kits may work for some but for many fans it diminishes the overall experience and immersion in the game

to add insult to injury the microtransaction model in efootball 2024 is predatory at best unlocking basic features and obtaining decent player cards often requires an investment that feels disproportionate to the value received its disheartening to see a game prioritize monetization over providing a fulfilling and fair gaming experience

in conclusion efootball 2024 is a disappointing entry into the football simulation genre with lackluster graphics frustrating gameplay connectivity issues licensing problems and a problematic microtransaction system its hard to find redeeming qualities in this release i would strongly advise football gaming enthusiasts to explore other more polished titles on the market

#####

want to give this a fair try but it doesnt really work on steam deck despite been variefied

#####

holy f
i rather play winning eleven 5 from 2 decades ago than this piece of shat

#####

before i played efootball 2022 i had a small wee wee no friends no boyfriend and absolutely no will to live none of these things have changed but the game is pretty gay

#####

the retarted version of fifa

#####

konami why

#####

tragic

#####

this is the big fifa killer eh

#####

bro what the fuck is this i used to play pes but this is not it i still have pes 17 in my old laptop and its still better than this

#####

this is the absolute worst football game ever made grats konami

#####

efootball has been receiving some negative reviews from angry fifa fans but in reality the game is actually decent and worth playing while it may not be comparable to fifa titles it still offers a solid soccer experience that can be enjoyed by fans of the sport

one of the biggest advantages of efootball is that it is free and fifa titles dont have that making it a great option for players who cannot afford the latest fifa release the game still offers a decent level of graphics sound and game play mechanics which may surprise some players who are expecting a poorquality game based on the reviews

the game has received criticism for lacking some of the features that players have come to expect from fifa games such as a fully licensed roster of teams and players however efootball still offers a decent selection of teams and players and the games mechanics are still enjoyable and challenging

ultimately efootball may not be the best soccer game on the market but it is certainly not a bad game like some of the reviews may suggest players who are looking for a budgetfriendly alternative to fifa titles may find that efootball is a solid option that offers a good soccer experience at the price point of free

#####

usually i dont write any reviews but what konami did with pes forced me to do it

as i heard they plan to make pes free to play i was excited because i saw the potential in it since years i refuse to buy every year the same game only with a squad update

so here is the new pes called efootball they advertised it as the new football experience with more realisitc gameplay and so on konami never mentioned really how the release will be and with what content it will start first time i started the game i thought i downloaded any kind of a demo but it was the full game you had a hand full of clubs to select from and thats all you couldnt change any important game settings so all games where 5 min long the player looked like from games 10 years ago the menu is anoying and unnecessary big not to mention all the bugs in the game and the not working ai

sorry konami i would love to see that game fullfill all the wishes any soccer player would love to see but until you change the core of the game efootball is the last soccer game i will play

#####

to many network cheater

#####

h1efootball has more bpotential in terms of actual gameplayb on fieldh1

icomparing to b70 counterpartb available on marketi








ibplease keep up the development work of efootball i wish it to be the next big thing in football games erabi

#####

after 998 hrs of struggling playing this cheap game i can confirmed you this game is not a trash but a garbage
ai is terrible especially when playing with any players that buy a lot of coins  those stat strategy is all useless against those

#####

the lag is comming again hate about the delay


#####

for a free game yeah its good but no worth of buying this shit load of game 

#####

trash

#####

the gameplay is quite different than previous years not perfect not the worst but quite different
at least it is less pay to win than the last online games

#####

with recent updates this game so much improve
great dribbling control and challenging defending harder than before update
still waiting for co op event and master league updates

thank you konami for improving this game

#####

awful

#####













#####

h1it seems to me or should developers pay players to play such rubbish no person in the world in their right mind would play this voluntarily those who leave good reviews blink if you are being held hostage ill call the fbi

#####

i saw the negative reviews before i downloaded the game and thought its probably just fifa fanboys but after i played the game i realised the game is just ass theres only 2 gamemodes in the free version and the gameplay feels clunky and unfinished it runs in 20fps and drops to 10 during cutscenes which is horrible considering i get 180 in fifa the only positive i found while playing was the commentary and the detail it went into and how they explained me trying to hard press with my strikers overall not worth sadly i was looking forward to all the features they promised

#####

degraded revert back to the old pes

#####

i tried it so hard but pes is truly dead
deep passes are inconsistent  try doing a long pass between the lines it is not going to work either high or below unless the defense is disorganized it also doesnt help that forward who are fast cannot gain advantage again any defender in a run really without the deep pass from pes13 or 15 what is the point of them being fast
somehow defending in this game is worse than in fifa almost every time pressing o guarantees you a yellow card or a penalty inside the box slide tackle is fine thought no complaints there
inconsistency in intercepting a pass  this one is annoying sometimes my player can intercept passes other times they let it go even though it is within their interception zone and considering the players i have at my disposal one being 97over and the other 95over they should be able to at least be consistent
passing needs to be faster  this game needs to be faster in terms of passing go and play older pes games and you will see that they may not be realistic but they are more enjoyable as it makes those games fastpace and dynamic
faster move set  the same as the above the game needs to be faster and the players need to move faster when doing passes running shooting etc most of the time it feels too slow
goalkeeping  i dont have any criticism other than the fact that someone scored a goal from a 45m freekick seriously fix that realistic or not you shouldnt be punished by something like that
need more tactics customization  in order to give you the options of how to tackle a difficult match you are losing winning or when youre about to start it could make the gameplay more fun to experience as the players will behave differently and i am aware this stop existing since pes13
i dont get how the point system works in divisions 13
look i know this game is simulating football but it is a game and games should be fun not necessarily realistic i get enough of that in real life the same is happening to fifa they kind of forgot that part of what makes them special was how the gameplay feels unrealistic but rewarding however it is free so only your time will be spent and this is just my opinion about the game for what it offers it makes sense why konami made it free to play

#####

its a big joke
wrost game ever i seen
rest in peace pes

#####

slow unexciting game to play menus are difficult to navigate was willing to give it a go but just didnt find myself enjoying it at any point

#####

ovo je najvece govno ikad napravljeno i onda updejt i jos vece govno jebem vam mater u picku dve hiljade dvadeset i dva puta

#####

if you wanna make it good please just bring back create player

#####

scripted game no matter how much you spend time and work on your skills and passing and all that that makes a game good for competition with other players the game decides if you will win or not by making your players complete amateurs that have never played football no matter of their grades

#####

as much as i despise ea and fifa this game has thought me to appreciate fifa once again this cancerous piece of garbage this trashy scripted piece of shit is the most cancerous and broken and braindead game i have ever played so thanks you braindead developers thanks for making me appreciate fifa once again because no matter how bad fifa is and it is really bad it is still lightyears better than this embarrassment of a game i dont know why any self respecting human being would ever play this utterly distugusting piece of shit game

#####

very good paytowin business model
multiplayer with friends doesnt work

#####

total dog poop

#####

what a rotten way to die

#####

absolute pay to win dog shit it is not only that when you meet full legendary team playing against you that they are better your team lose brain players forget that they have legs and its like having 11 retarded dogs without legs playing in your team it is also matching up much higher rank than yours but that is least of a problem with this game save nerves and skip

h1abandon all hope ye who enterh1



#####

the controls are jank you cant choose your team for the first match and they have an obsession with ronaldo 

several times when people would commit fouls none of them applied the entire game only four were called 

this game sucks fix the game

#####

what can i say about e football 2022 great frustration messi and ronaldo are like they came out of resident evil the ball is so heavy as if you are kicking a stone team rights nonexistent handling as if you are playing a 2004 game normally should konami to get the prize of the golden raspberry and not to make e football again

#####

call of duty is a more realistic football game

#####

pes has been in decline since 20 years now i steadily turned from the best game ever into a mediocre game

 it is now a software just made to manipulate you into spending on microtransactions
 it still has the awful midfield positioning so that you can play 5 defenders 5 strikers and be fine just ignore the midfield this is not the best tactic but it shouldnt even be possible
 features other than microtransactions have been stripped down even more now we need to make groups outside of the game to even play coop at all

that being said the game is still great compared to the likes of pes 6 2013 even 2018 it is a joke though sadly so i cannot give a thumbs up it feels like a bunch of greedy basta4rds have now taken over a great game and profit from the hard work of the folks that made the real pes

#####

dont waste your money on this game or fifa 23 keep your money until someone come up with a nice football game konami does same stupid things like ea

#####

why removed myclub mode  and master league 

#####

this game is terrible the graphics look like a mobile game i fancied a football game never liked the fifa games so checked the review sites and thought pes2021 looked good so i came to steam to give konami my money but it seems they no longer sell their pro evolution games on steam they are not selling their old games in favour of pushing a sub par mobile game which they allow you to see how bad it is for free once they realised this game was a flop why didnt they put their old games back up for sale seems like the executives running the football games at konami dont have a clue what they are doing they are clearly not in the business of making money from their products i managed to bag a copy of pro evolution soccer 2018 from a third party retailer for pennies and then installed the storm patch which brought the game right up to season 2022 that is my football fix sorted and konami out of pocket for a sale of one of their newer games absolutely backwards thinking 

#####

this is the worst thing that human have ever created  i cant imagine how the human still play this shitty game i felt like im playing ps2

#####
