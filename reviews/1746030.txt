Completed the whole game in Chinese, 6 Chapter and about 20 hours of game time. Definitely very "Ace Attorney", with it's concept of investigation, debating, finding contradictions and presenting evidences. 

Things i like:
- Very good music and atmosphere, you can already feel it when the game starts. Almost after every chapter, your steam ship will also move through the Yangtze River to other parts of the country, which shows beautiful "hand drawn" landscape follow by Chinese poem that describe the view.

- Great voice acting, China is a very big country with lots of diversity. Even though they might speak the same common tongue (Pu Tong Hua). Different part of the country has their own accent and slang. Even the British accent is there.

- Interesting story and cases, some involve Chinese folklore and superstitious, some has twist towards the end.

- Get to learn a few interesting history facts of that era, a bit of their lifestyle and even interesting laws under "Qing" dynasty.

Things i feel can improve:
- Like most detective game, some parts of it just don't make sense or hard to understand. Sometimes really don't know what evident they were asking you to present. Ended up just trial and error. Or maybe it's just me.

- I play in Chinese so not really affected, but what i saw from the trailer and ending credits. Most if not all of the characters has English name like John, Will, Katherine, Dan, Edgar etc. i can understand if the character study aboard and has English name, but common Chinese folks in that era should't be having English name at all. It's very immersion breaking.

All in all a very good game, anyone who enjoys "Ace Attorney" series should definitely try it.
really fun game and im so excited for the full release.
 the only criticism i have is that for a game set in retro china and a big theme already shown in the demo- the conflict with westerners and their growing influence in china- it's a very [b][i] interesting [/i][/b] choice to give every character a western first name. very bad localization, takes you out of the story seeing JOHN SHEN whenever your character speaks, or to see someone trying to fight the western influence in china named harry or lawrence or smth.
really hoping that's just an unfortunate try in the demo and it doesn't stick in the full game.
继生化危机4以后第一个一口气打穿的游戏，酣畅淋漓意犹未尽

6个案件环环相扣，一个主线贯穿始终，没有一个滥竽充数的案子，没有一个可有可无的人物，(批评一下严重水时间浪费生命的的逆转裁判56)，结尾又有伏笔让人期待续作

背景设定在历史上最精彩纷呈，百花齐放的晚清。虽然封建却又十分自由的社会氛围营造的很好，没有宏大叙事，没有民族大义，只是展示给了玩家一个个的人，编剧水平不输走向共和。最后一案子跌宕起伏，堪比逆转裁判3的最后一个案子

玩法杂糅了很多游戏，主要是逆转裁判，但是删除了冗余的法庭威慑，简化了调查举证，很符合现在这个时代的游戏节奏。推理上也不把玩家当傻子，每一个证据的选择，都是需要动脑筋思考的，一些显而易见的矛盾，都会直接说出，非常尊重玩家。还有小知识和史实收集，涨知识

制作也可圈可点，从第一章，到第6章能，能明显的感觉到立绘，场景，配音，文本，都在进步

2024目前最好玩的游戏，没有之一
I mean... this good game should have a english version

First case is really good. Definitely a worthy spiritual successor of the Ace Attorney series. Reminds me of Ace Attorney Investigations somewhat.

Will update if my opinion changes later in the game. 

Some notes:

* [b]English translation is found under the 2nd button on the main menu, the 4th button on the next menu, and the 3rd item (drop-down box) on the Settings menu.[/b]
* The translation is so far fairly good for a small team from China. Plenty of places where the translation could be improved but IIRC the game has something like 800,000 words. Hopefully the team commits a bit more time to improving the translation further, but it is playable at this stage in the game.
* Controller support is 7/10. Sometimes things feel unintuitive. For example, some text uses the left stick to scroll through, and others use the right stick. That said, the controls do the job once you get a hang of them.
* Graphics aren't very buttery. Everything feels stretched at 1440p.
* Really appreciating the insight into the late-Qing era as a Westerner.
* The end of the first case reveals a set up for the greater story. It's very well done, but puts a large expectation on the ending, but other reviews seem to indicate it pays off. I'm excited.

If you purchase this game, I hope you enjoy it as well.
This is a review of the whole game, played with the English language setting.

The good:
- Beautiful soundtrack that skillfully combines Chinese instrumental music with BGMs you'd expect to find in an Ace Attorney-style game. Very atmospheric while still fitting the detective side of the game.
- Fantastic voice acting, all voices fit the characters and the actors seem to be skilled professionals, a joy to listen to. I particularly enjoyed the segments where the characters swap between Chinese and English; the British accents were surprisingly good. Also, A-Fu's English was adorable. 
- Character designs, animation and art is of high quality; love how expressive some of the characters are. This might be a personal preference, but I found the character designs lovely and was looking forward to meeting new characters in each case. The main cast looks great as well and the extra outfits you can choose from are a nice touch.
- The cases are very fun and well thought out. There are some good twists and some moments were exciting to go through. Can't say too much to avoid spoilers, but the reveals "make sense" and are logical.
- The setting is interesting and provides a lot of background information for the historical/cultural elements of the era. The build-in glossary of important terms and events is a really nice touch and the background artwork sometimes feels like classical Chinese paintings.
- The price is surprisingly cheap for the quality and length of the game.

Things that could use some improvement:
- The translation overall is good when it comes to conveying the meaning, but needs another round of polish. I think the translation team decided to change the naming convention of the characters midway through translating so you can still spot some leftover "old" names here and there, especially in some evidence items. I spotted a few grammatical and punctuation errors as well, but for an indie Chinese game the translation is definitely above average. Considering the sheer amount of text in the game it was a very good effort and the English translation actually got delayed once so they could work on it more - great to see that the team cares about the quality of their game.
- The voice recording quality for some characters is worse than the others - I suppose some actors might have used their personal hardware for recording? The performances are all great so it doesn't detract from the game too much.

Overall I enjoyed the game a lot, and even for the full asking price it's a steal. I hope the dev team will have a chance to work on a sequel, as I would love to spend more time with the main cast, solving the cases & enjoying the atmosphere crafted by the team. It's fantastic to see games like this being released also for the English-speaking audiences - kudos to the developers for sharing their vision and Chinese culture with worldwide players.
I'd recommend this just for the soundtrack, but everything about it is excellent. If you liked The Great Ace Attorney, you need to play this too.

Runs wonderfully on Linux/Proton and on the Steam Deck as well!
Great game. Not a lot of puzzle games can combine mystery solving and history telling such well.
满分100分我想给150分的佳作！！！ 剧本完美，跌宕起伏悬疑感拉满，逻辑严密没有任何牵强刻意的地方。细节非常丰富，查案，对证，质证，和辩驳的过程沉浸感十足，真的是完美探案流程一步一步反复引导玩家思考每个角落和每种可能性，步步为营的感觉很刺激很爽！

整个背景设定在鸦片战争之后，整个游戏里介绍的史实小知识还有办案中用到的专业术语也是一大亮点，有种上了一学期中国近代史课程的感觉。了解像“磕肥”，“陶高能”这些清末百姓生活风物的小知识都很有趣！在洋务运动的大背景下阿福作为一个崇尚格物致知的角色非常巧妙地融入到主线剧情里。人物立绘都很精美，唯一不足的地方感觉是PC优化方面，偶尔会有点小卡顿但是几乎不影响体验。

推荐所有喜欢推理探案或是visual novel的朋友玩！！！希望不久就能玩到下一部！
Great story, great execution, such a good game. The developers probably spent all their budget into the game that the marketing presence of this game is too little for its quality. I would've paid $30 for it happily instead of 15.
Chinese version Ace Attorney with very special art styles, and great music.
I've only arrived in chapter 2, but it's actually a pretty good game so far.
It's a detective story that takes place during the final years of the Qing dynasty.
Subtitles are available in English, but the audio is exclusively in Chinese.
While this was admittedly unfamiliar at first, now I think that this fact actually adds to the overall authenticity of the game.
John Shen will always have a fan. Me.
I just started chapter 2 and this game is incredible. If you are a murder mystery and ace attorney fan, this game will meet and exceed your expectations. One thing that really sticks out to me is the great pacing. Just when things are starting to slow down, they pick right back up.
This game is beautifully crafted from start to end. The story telling is amazing with its timing and combination of graphics, music and voice acting. Gameplay is also really good with the game starting you off with the basics of how case solving works and then simultaneously increasing the difficulty along with development of plot and introduction of backstories. There are only 6 cases but feels like more considering the amount of time spent on actual deduction compared to investigation and discovering of clues. It's also based on real events and people from early 20th century China so you also get a free history lesson that doesn't feel forced.

One criticism would be that the game is rather unforgiving if you are stuck on any part and have to constantly restart, compared to Ace Attorney games where if you get a puzzle wrong multiple times the game will start to prompt you in the right direction. This is compensated with its quick loading access so its a rather minor issue. 

Highly recommend for all players who enjoy detective and puzzle games.
