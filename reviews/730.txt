This community is so nice i got a lot of tips on how to uninstall the game and kill myself
HACKERS EVERYWHERE!!!!
This game has made me racist, 10/10
too many hackers. None actions has been taken. Every games at least there is one wallers.
Don't be overconfident with what you see and hear. The enemy is a bit closer than expected.
Too many damn cheaters. Wait until they decide to actually fix the game's anti-cheat.
prolly Valve never reads this but oh my goood... what an absoulute f**ing pice of TRASH this game is... only cheaters every single Fu**ing game :) . For past 12 years you can only make new garbage skins and other stupid pointless sh**t BUT NO F***ng PROPER ANTI-CHEAT!? f**ng REALLLY? Valve GO FUC** yourself. really just kys trash company.
I love Counter-Strike. It has a great competitive experience and the gameplay is phenomenal. But Valve really messed up with this one. No official porting tools were created for the community gamemodes, so the maps are extremely limited. Valve went and ruined the server browser, and then made the original CS:GO almost impossible to access, killing the community servers and custom gamemodes made there. To top it all off, the main gamemode, Competitive is completely filled with cheaters from Silver 1 rank all the way up to Global Elite. You can't play a game without a cheater and you're lucky if he's rage hacking so that it's obvious. Most of the time, you'll be upset with yourself for not being good until you see them using ESP/aimlock in the game demo. Surf has become completely unplayable due to "surf bugs" that kill all momentum, and bhop maps are slowly released since there is no streamlined porting process made by Valve.

Valve needs to step their game up and better support the community with a better anti-cheat and more mapper support. First they ruined TF2 and now they ruin CS...
Lots of cheaters ):
laaaaaaaaag and a ton of hackers
Too many Russians and Turks.
This game is in a horrible state still. Even months after release. 
-Full of cheaters with no way of stopping them. 
-Stutters and lags when I see and enemy to the point that it's almost unplayable (w/ a good PC) 
-10 years to build a game that is 90% the same as the last meanwhile raking in hundreds of millions of dollars from the in- 
  game skin trading/selling & sale of skin case keys. (And I thought Call Of Duty was bad)
-Incredibly poor matchmaking and unrewarding ranking system.
-God awful ping tolerance, can't play unless the server is in your back yard. (Max playable ping ~30-40, down from 70-90 
  in CSGO).

Been playing CSGO since early 2013 until CS2 release and spent years in CS 1.6/Source yet the progress has only gone backwards. Valve has out-lazied the laziest of game developers with this "masterpiece" of a game. 
Wasting everyone's time playing a broken game. 
So far, Valve, all that the players hear from you is talk... barely. Do better. This has truly become exhausting even for casual players like myself. 
Time to take this seriously because so far, this has been nothing but a huge letdown for most of the player base.

Every second game you face a cheater on this game. You lag, disconnect randomly and freeze sometime. So if you spend time having fun and not frustrated, dont play this game, its unplayable.

Community is not very helpful or patient with beginners.
The CS2 Update nuked the unranked normal game mode, so there's no way for a beginner to learn playing the game in a realistic environment. You're forced to play either the competitive Premier mode, in which you only get assigned a skill group after winning 10 matches, or the generic ranked mode in which, again, you need to win 10 matches on each map to be assigned the respective map's skill group.
Since you're matched up against players with thousands of hours of experience until you get a skill group, you're probably going to lose a lot more than you win. This leads to you having to play a frustrating amount of games with unfair skill disparities between teams.
There's not even a lot you can learn from playing against much better opponents other than "Guess I should aim better." and "Maybe I shouldn't have been here.".
On top of the enemy probably ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on your head every game, your team mates will flame and even kick vote you out of the game if your performance can't keep up with the rest.
You really need a thick skin if you want to pick this game up as a solo player, especially when this is your first FPS game.
A CS veteran's heartbreak – this isn't Counter-Strike anymore

I've been playing CS since the 1.6 and Source days – over 1,200 hours logged between the two. The raw gameplay, the gritty maps, the incredible community mods – that was CS.  CS:GO was already a step in the wrong direction, and CS2 feels like they kicked the franchise while it was down.

Where's the modding soul? No custom maps, no crazy community servers? CS used to be a playground for creativity, now it's a sterile corporate product.

Microtransactions killed the vibe: Paying for weapon skins that used to be FREE community creations? Paying for map packs that would've been awesome workshop additions? It's insulting.

Gameplay feels... off: I can't put my finger on it, but the movement, the gunplay, it doesn't have that classic CS tightness. Like they tried to copy the "modern shooter" feel and ruined the formula.

No respect for the legacy: Where's the respect for the iconic maps, the old-school game modes, the history of this series? Feels like they just want to milk a familiar name.

Bottom Line:  If you loved the old-school CS, this ain't it. It's a soulless, cash-grabbing imitation that misses the whole point of what made Counter-Strike special.
I play this game on Steam Deck with a joystick.
You ruined this game. Bring back CSGO.
After multiple manifestations of nefarious nexuses between cs competitive mode and my local electricity company ended in me getting kicked out of games or if I got delayed enough, having a competitive lockdown on me I decided to write this review.
Don’t let the 250 hours fool you. They are representative more of how bad my aim is. I hope to become aware of how bad my gamesense is by the time I reach 1000 hours. 
So far, I have mainly played 2 maps Dust 2 and Mirage. 
Dust 2 is easy to play even with my poor gamesense and aim. Mirage, not so much. It is full of 200 IQ moves. 
Other maps I played were Nuke, Inferno and one unfortunate day, Overpass. Every time I played them, I felt as if I was playing them for the first time (which, I was). It is hard to find casual matches for these maps, so my knowledge of them was lacking.
Specially Inferno. Inferno is a great name for this map as it will allow to descend to depths of toxicity I thought were impossible. It also acts as a great tester of one’s friendship with friends. As while we got lambasted again and again by randoms, we found solace in the fact that we all sucked. 

I was fortunate enough to have half decent rig by the time I started playing cs2. The game still has micro-stutters, and packet loss. And at the time of launch you would have to wait for shaders or stuff to compile every time you started a new map, meanwhile the game would stutter. 
A lot of people with potato and potato adjacent systems got straight up locked out of the game.
We got cool volumetric smokes out of it though.

The game still is good. And with right set of people it is enjoyable. There is pretty high skill ceiling (I should know, I haven’t even breached from hell to the skill floor yet).

If you have a dedicated group of friends, or have a thick skin this game is an easy recommendation for you. For solo play, I would suggest trying out the casual mode first (casual mode has more toxic players in my experience, which is weird)
PS: The game still has a hacker problem. You won’t find them in every match, but you WILL find them.
I will update this review once I become more enlightened about the workings of Counter Strike.
